    abstract = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications related to agriculture have recently gained in use and attention. They are indeed valuable tools for interpreting data, improving production chains, and optimizing the use of natural resources. Among AI models, the most recent and promising area is represented by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI). After an initial description of its general model architectures, this work aims to review its practical uses and potentials in the following individual sectors: agriculture, precision farming, and animal farming, as well as interdisciplinary applications. The literature search was carried out using the SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. GAI holds immense potential for revolutionizing agriculture, offering solutions ranging from precision farming to pest management and supply chain optimization. Though some applications can extend beyond efficiency gains, and hallucinations occurrence i.e. false output information presented as fact, remains an open issue, GAI can be decisive for tasks like improving training datasets, refining models, and facilitating time series analysis. This review extensively describes the vital importance of these tasks for agriculture, precision and animal farming, caused by the rise of new technologies. As a result, by embracing and responsibly implementing GAI applications, it is possible to create a more sustainable and resilient future for agriculture and precision farming. GAI have the capacity to extract specific information from big data systems, offering huge potential to meet a growing global population demand and consequent environmental challenges for the future."

However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate."

Renowned for its advanced natural language processing capabilities, generative AI has shown promise in psychological counseling, emotional support, and clinical interventions. However, its application alongside neuroscience and physiology in psychiatry remains underexplored. We propose that generative AI can facilitate translations and adaptive explanations, streamline experimental preparation, enhance multi-modal data analysis, and improve clinical applications through real-time communication, content generation, and data synthesis. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI, as a specialized application of deep learning, can identify new biomarkers and construct neurophysiological models of psychiatric symptoms. We also discuss the synergistic relationship between neuroscience and AI development, particularly in improving AI's emotional recognition and learning mechanisms. While acknowledging the potential benefits, we address the challenges and risks associated with generative AI in psychiatry, including data reliability, privacy concerns, and resource constraints. This perspective advocates for a balanced approach to leveraging AI's capabilities while safeguarding mental health."

Routine care data (laboratory results, medication orders, progress notes) and research-generated datasets now fuel state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) pipelines that sharpen diagnosis, prognosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and, by combining both sources, accelerate drug discovery. In diagnostics, deep networks that now flag pneumonia or tuberculosis on chest images are increasingly able to identify—and localize—virtually more infectious processes throughout the body, while simultaneously predicting pathogen identity and antimicrobial resistance from routine microbiology. Prognostic models trained on Electronic Health Records surpass traditional scores in anticipating clinical deterioration or postoperative sepsis, enabling earlier targeted interventions. Predictive analytics can also personalize antimicrobial dosing by fusing real-time drug-monitoring data. Large language models (LLMs) build upon these advances by transforming unstructured clinical narratives into structured phenotypes suitable for predictive modeling, automatically summarizing patient encounters, generating synthetic cohorts for rare conditions, and providing real-time conversational decision support at the patient’s bedside. Despite rapid progress, real-world deployment faces hurdles: high computational and licensing costs, vendor-specific implementation constraints, limited cross-site model transferability, and fragmented governance of safety, bias, and cybersecurity risks. Rigorous, lifecycle-based evaluation frameworks—covering external validation, cost-effectiveness analysis, and post-deployment monitoring—are required to ensure safe, equitable, and sustainable AI adoption. This review synthesizes current applications, evidential strengths, and unresolved challenges, and proposes a translational roadmap aligning technical innovation with clinical and regulatory realities."

    abstract = "Background Health care chatbots can be used to support patients and their families with everyday decision-making. While there is some research on integrating artificial intelligence into pediatric care, no study has focused on the opportunity of implementing a generative artificial intelligence chatbot for pediatric rheumatology. Pediatric rheumatology conditions require intense family input, which can often leave families struggling to navigate disease flares, pain, fatigue, medication side effects and adherence, and support of their child, often when pediatric rheumatology departments are shut. Understanding how we can support families better, without the need for increased personnel, will have implications for the health care systems. Objective The study aimed to explore parental and children and young people’s acceptance of chatbot use in a pediatric context, and understand how a chatbot could be specifically used for managing a child’s chronic health condition. Methods This study was a mixed methods design, using both a family workshop and a subsequent questionnaire. Results In total, 22 participants contributed to the qualitative design using the world café methodology at a workshop, and 47 participants (36 parents and 11 children and young people) completed quantitative data via a questionnaire. Participants expressed their likelihood of using chatbot technology, including ChatGPT, due to its accessibility. However, participants had significantly greater intention (parents: P<.001; children and young people: P=.006) to use a specific chatbot over ChatGPT, due to increased trust, credibility, and specificity in design. Children and young people and parents should be distinguished as 2 user groups in chatbot design, reflecting their specific needs in chatbot features and personalization. Conclusions Overall, the study reinforced the need for a specialized and trusted chatbot designed with input from health professionals to assist families in managing complex chronic health conditions to support families in between appointments and complement existing face-to-face care. Future research should evaluate users’ engagement with a functional prototype to investigate its usefulness and explore its implementation into families’ everyday lives. Importantly, the current findings have broader implications for the field of pediatric health care, as similarly tailored chatbot interventions could benefit families who are managing other chronic health conditions."

Objective This study aims to examine whether digital agents constructed using fast-evolving generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to improve consultations, adherence to treatment, and health literacy. We interviewed patients and physicians to obtain their opinions about 3 digital agents—a silent digital expert, a communicative digital expert, and a digital companion (DC). Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with 25 patients and 22 physicians from a purposeful sample, with the patients having a wide age range and coming from different educational backgrounds and the physicians having different medical specialties. Transcripts of the interviews were deductively coded using MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH) and then summarized according to code and interview before being clustered for interpretation. Results Statements from patients and physicians were categorized according to three consultation phases: (1) silent and communicative digital experts that are part of the consultation, (2) digital experts that hand over to a DC, and (3) DCs that support patients in the period between consultations. Overall, patients and physicians were open to these forms of digital support but had reservations about all 3 agents. Conclusions Ultimately, we derived 9 requirements for designing digital agents to support consultations, treatment adherence, and health literacy based on the literature and our qualitative findings."

We also identify conceptual debates within the SDT literature and between SDT and other literatures, and discuss their relevance with respect to PA. We particularly focus on tripartite conceptualizations of interpersonal styles and psychological needs, whether there are more than three basic psychological needs, and the use of financial incentives and competition to promote PA.

Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming. Objective This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data. Methods We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability. Results Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results. Conclusions Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support."

    abstract = "Aim To assess the clinical reasoning capabilities of two large language models, ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0, compared to those of neonatal nurses during neonatal care scenarios. Design A cross-sectional study with a comparative evaluation using a survey instrument that included six neonatal intensive care unit clinical scenarios. Participants 32 neonatal intensive care nurses with 5–10 years of experience working in the neonatal intensive care units of three medical centers. Methods Participants responded to 6 written clinical scenarios. Simultaneously, we asked ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 to provide initial assessments and treatment recommendations for the same scenarios. The responses from ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 were then scored by certified neonatal nurse practitioners for accuracy, completeness, and response time. Results Both models demonstrated capabilities in clinical reasoning for neonatal care, with Claude-2.0 significantly outperforming ChatGPT-4 in clinical accuracy and speed. However, limitations were identified across the cases in diagnostic precision, treatment specificity, and response lag. Conclusions While showing promise, current limitations reinforce the need for deep refinement before ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 can be considered for integration into clinical practice. Additional validation of these tools is important to safely leverage this Artificial Intelligence technology for enhancing clinical decision-making. Impact The study provides an understanding of the reasoning accuracy of new Artificial Intelligence models in neonatal clinical care. The current accuracy gaps of ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 need to be addressed prior to clinical usage."

Robust biosafety and bioethics evaluations are therefore required to address potential risks such as immune reactions, cellular pathway disruptions, and environmental persistence. We systematically analyse the computational frameworks underpinning this revolution and highlight the capability of de novo proteins to act as a modular toolkit for synthetic biology. Looking forward, we envision integrating closed-loop validation with multi-omics profiling for comprehensive risk assessments along with a hierarchical design framework for advancing the future of synthetic biology – from the creation of tailored de novo functional protein modules and structure-guided rational genetic circuits design to the development of full-synthetic cellular systems, thereby establishing a scalable path from protein design to system-level implementation."

However, little is known about the variables driving the acceptance of these gadgets and the willingness of older adults in China to use them. Objective This study aims to explore the factors that affect the use of mobile health (mHealth) devices by older adults in China, focusing on individual, social, and family influences. Methods The Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents survey database provided the data for this study. The survey was conducted in 148 Chinese cities between June 20 and August 31, 2022. The parameters linked to older persons’ desire to use mobile medical devices were determined by this study using a combination model of multiple stepwise linear regression and a classification and regression tree decision tree. Results In total, 4085 older adults took part in the poll. On a scale of 0 to 100, the average score for willingness to adopt mHealth devices was 63.70 (SD 25.11). The results of the multiple stepwise linear regression showed that having a postgraduate degree and higher (β=.040; P=.007), being unemployed (β=.037; P=.02), having a high social status (β=.085; P<.001), possessing high health literacy (β=.089; P<.001), demonstrating high self-efficacy (β=.043; P=.02), not living with children (β=.0340; P=.02), having a household per capita monthly income of >Y4000 (US $550) (β=.048; P=.002), experiencing high perceived social support (β=.096; P<.001), reporting a high quality of life (β=.149; P<.001), having higher levels of family communication (β=–.071; P<.001), having an identity bubble (β=.085; P<.001), not having chronic diseases (β=.049; P=.001), and experiencing mild depression (β=–.035; P=.02) were associated with older adults’ willingness to use mHealth devices. The classification and regression tree decision tree model’s findings demonstrated that the primary determinants of older adults’ desire to use mHealth devices are quality of life, identity bubble, social status, health literacy, family health, and perceived social support. Conclusions This study uses the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model to investigate the effects of demand variables, enabling resources, and predisposing traits on older persons’ propensity to use mHealth devices. These results offer reference data for the marketing and use of mHealth devices for older individuals in the future. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to create a balanced and harmonious integration of technology and humanistic care."

The Girdlestone procedure, also known as resection arthroplasty, was originally described for native hips but has since been adopted as a salvage option for complex and recurrent prosthetic infections. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in treating prosthetic hip infections in this context. Materials and methods Eighty-eight patients (91 hips) who underwent femoral resection arthroplasty for refractory hip prosthesis infection between March 2004 and August 2019 were retrospectively included and analyzed as part of a single-center study with a minimum follow-up of two years. The primary outcome was infection eradication. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of treatment failure and the nature of postoperative complications. Risk factors for failure were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. Bacteriological data and functional outcomes were also reported. Results Out of 91 hips, infection eradication was achieved in 65 cases (71\%) following Girdlestone procedure. Six postoperative deaths related to infection occurred (6/88, 7\%). In 20 out of 91 hips (22\%), one or more revision surgeries were performed for persistent infection after implant removal. Among these, infection control was achieved in 10/20 (50\%). Multivariate analysis identified corticosteroid use (HR = 6; p < 0.01), preoperative fever (HR = 4.12; p < 0.01), and polymicrobial infection (HR = 2.5; p < 0.05) as independent risk factors for failure. The mean limb shortening was 5.7 (±1.7) cm, and the average walking distance was 175 (±350) meters. The mean Merle d’Aubigné and Postel score at final follow-up was 9.3 (±2.2) out of 18. Conclusion Definitive removal of the hip prosthesis remains a viable therapeutic option in refractory infections, despite a substantial complication rate. It should be considered, particularly when the prosthesis is no longer functional. Level of evidence IV; Retrospective case series."

    abstract = "Purpose To assess the ability of ChatGPT-4 and Gemini to generate accurate and relevant responses to the 2022 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Methods Responses from ChatGPT-4 and Gemini to prompts derived from all 15 AAOS guidelines were evaluated by 7 fellowship-trained orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons using a structured questionnaire assessing 5 key characteristics on a scale from 1 to 5. The prompts were categorized into 3 areas: diagnosis and preoperative management, surgical timing and technique, and rehabilitation and prevention. Statistical analysis included mean scoring, standard deviation, and 2-sided t tests to compare the performance between the 2 large language models (LLMs). Scores were then evaluated for inter-rater reliability (IRR). Results Overall, both LLMs performed well with mean scores >4 for the 5 key characteristics. Gemini demonstrated superior performance in overall clarity (4.848 ± 0.36 vs 4.743 ± 0.481, P = .034), but all other characteristics demonstrated nonsignificant differences (P > .05). Gemini also demonstrated superior clarity in the surgical timing and technique (P = .038) as well as the prevention and rehabilitation (P = .044) subcategories. Additionally, Gemini had superior performance completeness scores in the rehabilitation and prevention subcategory (P = .044), but no statistically significant differences were found amongst the other subcategories. The overall IRR was found to be 0.71 (moderate). Conclusions Both Gemini and ChatGPT-4 demonstrate an overall good ability to generate accurate and relevant responses to question prompts based on the 2022 AAOS CPG for ACLR. However, Gemini demonstrated superior clarity in multiple domains in addition to superior completeness for questions pertaining to rehabilitation and prevention. Clinical Relevance The current study addresses a current gap in the LLM and ACLR literature by comparing the performance of ChatGPT-4 to Gemini, which is growing in popularity with more than 300 million individual uses in May 2024 alone. Moreover, the results demonstrated superior performance of Gemini in both clarity and completeness, which are critical elements of a tool being used by patients for educational purposes. Additionally, the current study uses question prompts based on the AAOS CPG, which may be used as a method of standardization for future investigations on performance of LLM platforms. Thus, the results of this study may be of interest to both the readership of Arthroscopy and patients."

Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV \& Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability.

However, studies have shown that these materials often exceed the recommended sixth-grade reading level, making them difficult for many patients to understand. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to simplify PEMs into more readable educational content. Objective We sought to evaluate whether 3 LLMs (ChatGPT [OpenAI], Gemini [Google], and Claude [Anthropic PBC]) can optimize the readability of PEMs to the recommended reading level without compromising accuracy. Methods This cross-sectional study used 60 randomly selected PEMs available online from 3 websites. We prompted LLMs to simplify the reading level of online PEMs. The primary outcome was the readability of the original online PEMs compared with the LLM-simplified versions. Readability scores were calculated using 4 validated indices Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Index. Accuracy and understandability were also assessed as balancing measures, with understandability measured using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool-Understandability (PEMAT-U). Results The original readability scores for the American Heart Association (AHA), American Cancer Society (ACS), and American Stroke Association (ASA) websites were above the recommended sixth-grade level, with mean grade level scores of 10.7,10.0, and 9.6, respectively. After optimization by the LLMs, readability scores significantly improved across all 3 websites when compared with the original text. Compared with the original website, Wilcoxon signed rank test showed ChatGPT improved the readability to 7.6 from 10.1 (P<.001); Gemini, to 6.6 (P<.001); and Claude, to 5.6 (P<.001). Word counts were significantly reduced by all LLMs, with a decrease from a mean range of 410.9-953.9 words to a mean range of 201.9-248.1 words. None of the ChatGPT LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate, while 3.3\% of Gemini and Claude LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate. Baseline understandability scores, as measured by PEMAT-U, were preserved across all LLM-simplified versions. Conclusions This cross-sectional study demonstrates that LLMs have the potential to significantly enhance the readability of online PEMs while maintaining accuracy and understandability, making them more accessible to a broader audience. However, variability in model performance and demonstrated inaccuracies underscore the need for human review of LLM output. Further study is needed to explore advanced LLM techniques and models trained for medical content."

Objective This study aims to quantify ChatGPT’s ability to consistently follow formatting instructions and create simulations for preclinical medical student learners according to principles of medical simulation and multimedia educational technology. Methods Using ChatGPT-4 and a prevalidated starting prompt, the authors ran 360 separate simulations of an acute asthma exacerbation. A total of 180 simulations were given correct answers and 180 simulations were given incorrect answers. ChatGPT was evaluated for its ability to adhere to basic simulation parameters (stepwise progression, free response, interactivity), advanced simulation parameters (autonomous conclusion, delayed feedback, comprehensive feedback), and medical accuracy (vignette, treatment updates, feedback). Significance was determined with χ² analyses using 95\% CIs for odds ratios. Results In total, 100\% (n=360) of simulations met basic simulation parameters and were medically accurate. For advanced parameters, 55\% (200/360) of all simulations delayed feedback, while the Correct arm (157/180, 87\%) delayed feedback was significantly more than the Incorrect arm (43/180, 24\%; P<.001). A total of 79\% (285/360) of simulations concluded autonomously, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in autonomous conclusion (146/180, 81\% and 139/180, 77\%; P=.36). Overall, 78\% (282/360) of simulations gave comprehensive feedback, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in comprehensive feedback (137/180, 76\% and 145/180, 81\%; P=.31). ChatGPT-4 was not significantly more likely to conclude simulations autonomously (P=.34) and provide comprehensive feedback (P=.27) when feedback was delayed compared to when feedback was not delayed. Conclusions These simulations have the potential to be a reliable educational tool for simple simulations and can be evaluated by a novel 9-part metric. Per this metric, ChatGPT simulations performed perfectly on medical accuracy and basic simulation parameters. It performed well on comprehensive feedback and autonomous conclusion. Delayed feedback depended on the accuracy of user inputs. A simulation meeting one advanced parameter was not more likely to meet all advanced parameters. Further work must be done to ensure consistent performance across a broader range of simulation scenarios."

However, violence against sex workers (VASW) is underreported, and sex workers hesitate to report to the police because they are frequently punished; therefore, an alternative for reporting is needed. Sex workers also face stigmatization from health care workers, further discouraging help-seeking behavior or reporting in health care facilities. Sex workers have been recipients of services from nongovernmental organizations, typically related to HIV and sexual transmission of infections, but violence remains underaddressed. Objective This study aims to apply human-centered design methods to adapt ReportVASW for use in the Middle East and North Africa and to evaluate the usability of the prototype interface and identify opportunities for improvement. Methods Evaluation methods included cognitive walkthrough and System Usability Scale by 9 potential end users, and heuristic evaluation by 2 informatics professionals and 2 service providers. Results This study explores ways to improve the trilingual prototype of ReportVASW, with particular attention to ways to improve the data collection tool. Multiple methods identified multiple issues to address. Heuristic analysis revealed 2 serious issues to address, with scores over 2.5 out of 4 in the tool used. The most serious problems identified in heuristic analysis were related to language, particularly the Arabic version. Translation issues were addressed before end user testing. End users were enthusiastic about the idea of a mobile tool to document VASW, provided it led to change. They gave ReportVASW a System Usability Scale of 91.4, above the 68 considered good. Even as end users were enthusiastic, they offered suggestions for improvement. Conclusions Many opportunities to improve the interface were identified. Most changes are not overly complex, and the majority involve adapting the language used and improving the translation. Development of the trilingual ReportVASW data collection tool for the Middle East and North Africa region is worth pursuing."

It has the potential to support people’s desires for health, along with the potential to nudge or push people to behave in a certain way.To understand these potentials, we must see AI in the light of social developments that have brought about changes in how medicine’s role, in a given society, is understood.The trends of ‘privatisation of medicine’ and ‘public-healthisation of the private’ are proposed as a contextual backdrop to explain why AI raises ethical concerns different from those previously caused by new medical technologies, and which therefore need to be addressed specifically for AI."

    abstract = "Backgrounds Children undergoing orthopedic procedures often present numerous risk factors for thromboembolism. A recent survey, conducted by the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA), indicates that pediatric orthopedic surgeons are unaware of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention protocols and feel that certain procedures should require thromboprophylaxis. The aim of this systematic review was to properly assess the incidence of VTE in pediatric orthopedics. By using a thorough and broad search of the literature, the incidence according to different subspecialties of pediatric orthopedics was evaluated. Methods A systematic review on VTE in pediatric orthopedics was conducted. Four databases were searched for articles reporting these events. Three major search concepts: “pediatrics”, “orthopedic surgery/trauma” and “VTE complications” were used and broken down in MeSH, EmTree and their free vocabulary synonyms for proper literature review. Two independent authors screened 8467 titles and abstracts. Seventy articles reporting VTE in children treated by orthopedic surgeons were selected for data extraction. We reported median incidences by orthopedic subtypes and by study characteristics with a semi-quantitative review model. Results The 70 articles yielded a total of 845,010 participants. Spine articles (33/70) provided 25,2\% of the children included in the review. Trauma studies (16/70) accounted for 47.5\% of the participants. The overall VTE median incidence was 0.16\% [95\% CI: 0.0–1.01\%]. Musculoskeletal infections had a noticeably higher median incidence of 3.5\% [CI: 0.0–13.8\%]. Small variations were seen for the other subtypes: trauma, spine and elective surgeries. Subgroups by article characteristics did not differ significantly either. Conclusion Thrombotic complications are rare events in pediatric orthopedics, but knowledge epidemiologic is important because its potential severity. In this review, VTE median incidence for all orthopedic subtypes was around 0.16\% [CI: 0.0–1.01\%]. According to subspecialty assessment, musculoskeletal infections were associated with greater risk of VTE occurrence. Level of evidence III – Systematic review."

    abstract = "This study aims to investigate which factors influence third-party developers' choice of metaverse platforms. As the metaverse has garnered considerable attention, many metaverse platforms have explosively launched. The intensified competition among metaverse platforms is increasing the value of third-party developers, who play a role of complementors in platform ecosystems as creating virtual properties. Despite the significant role of developers in the sustainability of these nascent metaverse platforms, our understanding of their choice of platforms remains sparse. The study employed an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is widely recognized for its efficiency in evaluating and ranking criteria at various levels within a hierarchical structure, aiding in systematic decision-making. The study scrutinizes not only the weights of three evaluation criteria (market attractiveness, technological readiness, and platform readiness), which have been commonly used in research on platform complementors, along with their sub-criteria, but also probes into developers' ultimate choice of specific platforms. Findings show that while user size, a sub-criterion of market attractiveness, emerges as the most crucial factor, the support of the developer community is less significant, differing from previous research findings. The study not only significantly enhances our understanding of the contemporary metaverse ecosystem, but also enriches knowledge of platform complementors."

    abstract = "ABSTRACT Fasting prior to percutaneous cardiac procedures is common, despite a lack of high-quality evidence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety of a nonfasting strategy. Online databases Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were searched. Quantitative analysis was performed using R software (Version 4.1.2) with meta package. Analyzed outcomes included nausea, vomiting, aspiration, intubation, hypoglycemia, hypotension, acute kidney injury, patient satisfaction score, and length of hospital stay. Eight randomized controlled trials were included with 3,382 patients. There was no significant difference between fasting and nonfasting for nausea/vomiting odds ratio (OR) 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.68-1.45), hypoglycemia OR 1.28 (95\% CI, 0.75-2.18), aspiration OR 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.36-1.43), acute kidney injury OR 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.38-1.23), and hypotension OR 1.57 (95\% CI, 0.47-5.30). No patient in either group underwent endotracheal intubation. Additionally, there was no difference in patient satisfaction score and length of hospital stay with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.23 (95\% CI, -0.62 to 1.07) and 0.0 (95\% CI, -0.6 to 0.7) respectively. Sub-group analysis, however, showed increased odds of nausea/vomiting in the fasting group compared to nonfasting OR 1.20 (95\% CI, 1.04-1.39) and decreased odds of acute kidney injury in fasting compared to nonfasting group OR 0.50 (95\% CI, 0.28-0.89). In conclusion, this analysis shows no significant difference in most safety outcomes between a fasting and a nonfasting strategy with potential increase in nausea/vomiting and decrease in acute kidney injury with fasting. More studies are needed to better understand these differences."

    abstract = "Backgrounds Magnetic controlled growing rods (MCGRs) have been proven to be effective in controlling early onset neuromuscular scoliosis but no study has evaluated the combination with a sacro-bi-iliac construct. The aim of our study is to report surgical management of early onset non-walkers neuromuscular scoliosis correction using MCGRs associated with a sacro-bi-iliac “T-construct” and its mid-term outcomes. Our hypothesis was that this set-up provided well correction of the pelvic obliquity and that this correction was maintained over time. Methods A retrospective single-center study was conducted including all consecutive neuromuscular early onset scoliosis who underwent spinopelvic fixation using “T-construct” with two MCGRS. Four millimeters lengthening was performed every 4 months during outpatient clinics sessions. All children had a low-dose biplanar stereoradiography in EOS-Chair at pre/postoperative phase, each outpatient clinic appointment and last follow-up. Results Eighteen patients were included and 17 analyzed at the last follow-up. The mean age at surgery was 9.5 (range from 5 to 12 years), the mean follow-up was 4,7 years (range from 2.5 to 6.6 years) and 8 patients had a Risser stage above four. The global complication rate was 35\% (N = 6/17 patients) including three medical and three mechanical complications related to “T-construct”, while the reoperation rate was 18\% (N = 2 patients for wound debridement and one for iterative pelvic fixation). Cobb angle and pelvic obliquity were significantly improved by surgery (mean correction was 33.2 ° (55\%) and 11 ° (77\%) respectively; p < 0.001). At the last follow-up, we noted a loss of frontal Cobb angle correction (p < 0.01) whereas we did not observe any significant loss of pelvic obliquity (p > 0.9). Conclusions Although the global complication rate was 35\% (half of which are mechanical complications), the treatment combining pelvic T-construct and MCGRs provides satisfactory correction of pelvic obliquity correction, good maintenance in the medium term and may be a procedure to consider for the surgical treatment of early onset neuromuscular scoliosis.

Addressing the current lack of guidance in this area, the paper conceptualizes how AI agents can be specifically tailored to foster creativity in young learners. Drawing upon theoretical foundations and empirical evidence, it proposes a “Creative Project Approach” that integrates generative AI and robotics in ECE. A pedagogical framework is developed, consisting of five key steps: (1) identifying learning needs, (2) facilitating child-robot interaction with teacher guidance, (3) situating AI and robot use in various learning contexts, (4) determining the appropriate level of automation and creativity, and (5) evaluating learning outcomes. The paper suggests that leveraging generative AI and robotics within the Creative Project Approach holds significant promise for fostering engagement and creativity in AI-native children."
