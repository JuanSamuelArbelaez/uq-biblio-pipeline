abstract = {Summary
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, with approximately 5 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019. Tackling AMR requires a multifaceted and cohesive approach that ranges from increased understanding of mechanisms and drivers at the individual and population levels, AMR surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, improved infection prevention and control measures, and strengthened global policies and funding to development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic strategies. In this rapidly advancing field, this Review provides a concise update on AMR, encompassing epidemiology, evolution, underlying mechanisms (primarily those related to last-line or newer generation of antibiotics), infection prevention and control measures, access to antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship, AMR surveillance, and emerging non-antibiotic therapeutic approaches. The Review also discusses the potential roles of artificial intelligence in addressing AMR, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, AMR surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnosis, and antimicrobial drug discovery and development. This Review highlights the urgent need for addressing the global effects of AMR and for rapid advancement of relevant technology in this dynamic field.}

abstract = {Many online collaborative projects such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap organize collaboration among their contributors sequentially. When engaging in sequential collaboration, one contributor creates an initial entry which is then consecutively adjusted or maintained by the following contributors. Thereby, only the latest version of this entry is presented to subsequent contributors. Sequential collaboration was recently examined as a method for aggregating numerical judgments compared to averaging independently provided judgments (i.e., wisdom of crowds). Sequential collaboration was shown to yield increasingly accurate judgments that result in estimates that are at least as accurate as those obtained from aggregating independent judgments. However, sequential collaboration differs from simply aggregating independent judgments in the sequential nature of the process of providing judgments and in the possibility of contributors to opt out of providing a judgment by maintaining it. How these different features contribute to the accuracy of provided judgments is still unknown. In two experiments, we found that the most accurate judgments were provided by participants who engaged in standard sequential collaboration (with an opt-out option), whereas participants who performed sequential collaboration without opt-out gave less accurate judgments; and independent judgments were least accurate. Thus, both the sequential-collaboration process per se as well as the possibility to opt out and not provide a judgment contribute to the accuracy of contributions. These two features come together in a typical sequential-collaboration paradigm. Allowing contributors to use sequential collaboration in collaborative online projects or at least implement some features of sequential collaboration can be beneficial for the resulting entries and information.}

abstract = {Background
Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sALL) is rare in patients diagnosed with antecedent multiple myeloma (MM). This study aimed to elucidate the clinical features and outcomes of patients with sALL after MM.
Methods
We conducted this population-based study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and retrospectively reviewed patients with sALL following MM treatment at our institution. Cox regression analysis was performed to investigate the prognostic factors for survival in patients with sALL.
Results
We identified 64,629 cases of MM (including 18 sALL from the SEER Plus 9 database, and three sALL from our institution). Younger patients with MM and those who received chemotherapy were at a higher risk of developing sALL. The novel agent era witnessed an increased incidence of sALL (post-novel agent era vs. pre-novel agent era: 0.31% [10/32,640] vs. 0.25% [8/31,989]) and shorter latency time (post-novel agent era vs. pre-novel agent era [median]: 51.5 vs. 74.5 months, P = 0.516), though the difference was not significant. The median age at sALL onset was 65 (range: 47–78) years. Significant cytopenia and absence of BCR/ABL fusion genes were common features in this patient population. The treatment of sALL is complicated by old age and poor performance status. The median survival of patients with sALL is 18 months, whereas those who received chemotherapy had significantly prolonged survival.
Conclusions
Patients with sALL combined with an antecedent MM, especially those with long-term exposure to immunomodulatory agents such as thalidomide or lenalidomide, should be cautiously evaluated and managed with a comprehensive approach.}

Despite the outstanding achievements, mRNA vaccines still face challenges such as stringent storage requirements, insufficient antigen expression, and unexpected immune responses. Since the intrinsic properties of mRNA molecules significantly impact vaccine performance, optimizing mRNA design is crucial in preclinical development. In this review, we outline four key principles for optimal mRNA sequence design: enhancing ribosome loading and translation efficiency through untranslated region (UTR) optimization, improving translation efficiency via codon optimization, increasing structural stability by refining global RNA sequence and extending in-cell lifetime and expression fidelity by adjusting local RNA structures. We also explore recent advancements in computational models for designing and optimizing mRNA vaccine sequences following these principles. By integrating current mRNA knowledge, addressing challenges, and examining advanced computational methods, this review aims to promote the application of computational approaches in mRNA vaccine development and inspire novel solutions to existing obstacles.}

However, existing DiffGP approaches often overlook the uncertainty in kernel hyperparameters by treating them as fixed and time-invariant, which degrades the model’s predictive performance and neglects the posterior distribution. In this work, we introduce a fully Bayesian framework that models kernel hyperparameters as random variables and utilizes coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to jointly learn their posterior distributions alongside those of inducing points. By incorporating the estimation uncertainty of hyperparameters, our method significantly enhances model flexibility and adaptability to complex dynamic systems. Furthermore, we employ a black-box adaptive SDE solver with a neural network to achieve realistic, time-varying posterior approximations, thereby improving the expressiveness of the variational posterior. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and other key performance metrics. This work not only provides a robust Bayesian extension to DiffGP models but also validates its effectiveness in handling intricate dynamic behaviors, thereby advancing the applicability of Gaussian process models in diverse real-world scenarios.}

abstract = {Introduction
Simulation based education (SBE) and creatively designed placements are becoming increasingly well established in radiography pedagogy and allow a more efficient use of clinical resources in the training of new radiographers to meet workforce demands. Student radiographers have expressed concern about striking a balance between providing patient centered care and developing their radiographic competency. A co-designed simulated placement was developed with a focus on these two aspects of radiography education aiming to increase the competence and confidence of level 4 students while incorporating patient centred care (PCC) into their practice.
Methods
A multidisciplinary approach was used to develop a nine-day simulation where activities were scaffolded to help student radiographers to learn, develop and revisit critical skills. The students completed a reflective journal during this placement, the contents of which were thematically analysed.
Results
Students reported a statistically significant improvement in perceived confidence levels related to both radiographic and broad-based skills after simulation sessions. Several additional themes emerged from the reflective data related to communication skills, preparation for practice, perceptions of simulation and an empowered identity as a student radiographer. The students’ reflective diaries also explored students’ perceptions of their roles in the promotion patient centred care and they reported that the addition of realistic stressors inspired by the clinical environment, allowed them to practice dealing with these situations in a safe space.
Conclusion
: SBE effects students’ perceptions of their competence and confidence in the clinical environment. By providing a safe space, SBE empowers students to respond to some stressors that might be encountered in clinical practice. A carefully scaffolded, multidisciplinary approach to simulated placement is good for confidence and competence building.
Implications for practice
The multi-professional dynamic partnership enabled effective collaboration to deliver a positively evaluated simulation package. Students were motivated to deliver enhanced PCC and had a strong desire to drive change, to guarantee patient safety and high-quality care.}

Purpose
To examine the effectiveness of evaluating widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for detecting glaucoma progression compared with conventional circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFLT) measurements.
Design
Longitudinal study.
Participants
One-hundred and fifty-six eyes with glaucoma from 115 participants.
Methods
This study included individuals seen over ≥2 visits that were 12 months apart, and who were also scheduled for retest visits within ≤1 month at the baseline and 12-month visits. A circumpapillary circle scan on spectral-domain OCT and a widefield 15×15 mm OCT volume scan was acquired from each eye at each visit. A total of 286 and 284 unique visit pairs were thus available where OCT scans were obtained 12 months and ≤1 month apart respectively, serving as the case and control groups respectively. Widefield OCT scans from these visit pairs were evaluated by two graders, who assessed the ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness and thickness difference maps for glaucoma progression, masked to the time difference between the two scans.
Main Outcome Measures
Percentage of eyes deemed as progressing at 95% specificity.
Results
Evaluation of widefield OCT scans identified >2 times as many eyes as progressing over a 12-month period (Grader 1 = 36.7%, Grader 2 = 38.1%) than cpRNFLT measurements from spectral-domain OCT (16.8%; P<0.001 for both) at 95% specificity. For the subset of 96 (62%) eyes with a baseline visual field mean deviation (MD) ≥-6 dB, evaluation of widefield OCT scans identified ≥3 times as many eyes as progressing (Grader 1= 41.1, Grader 2 = 46.3%) compared to cpRNFLT measurements (13.6%; P<0.001 for both). There was substantial between-grader agreement for the eyes identified as progressing on widefield OCT imaging (Gwet’s first-order coefficient [AC1] = 0.76). Evaluation of widefield OCT scans in a two-arm trial seeking to detect a ≥30% treatment effect in one study eye with 80% power was estimated to reduce sample size requirements by 69% compared to cpRNFLT measurements, or by 80% when only including eyes with an MD ≥-6 dB.
Conclusions
Qualitative evaluation of widefield OCT scans showed an enhanced detection rate for structural progression than cpRNFLT measurements in glaucoma eyes.}

abstract = {Introduction
Cutaneous traction is used to temporize lower extremity fractures and relies on friction between the skin and surrounding material to apply a longitudinal force. This circumferential compressive force can lead to pressure sores, skin sloughing, or compressive neuropathies. These complications have been reported in up to 11% of patients when the cutaneous traction relies on adhesive tapes, plaster, and rubber bandages being in immediate contact with the skin. The rates of these complications are not well documented when using modern foam boots.
Methods
A retrospective chart review was performed on all orthopedic trauma patients who suffered pelvic or lower extremity injuries between March 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2021 at a single Level-1 trauma center. We included all patients with femoral fractures, axially unstable pelvic ring and/or acetabular fractures, and unstable hip dislocations temporized with the use of cutaneous traction. All patients had intact skin and lower extremity nerve function prior to application.
Results
There were 138 patients identified with 141 lower extremities. The average patient age was 50.7 (6–100) years. Mean traction weight of 9.8 (5–20) pounds. Average traction duration was 20.9 (2.3–243.5) hours. At the time of traction removal, there was 1 (0.7%) new skin wound and 0 nerve palsies. The new skin wound was a stage one heel pressure sore and did not require further treatment.
Conclusion
Cutaneous traction with a modern foam boot was found to have a skin complication rate of 0.7% and a nerve palsy complication rate of 0% for an overall complication rate of 0.7%, which has not been previously established and is lower than historically reported complication rates of 11% when utilizing adhesive and plaster directly on skin. Foam boot Cutaneous traction may be considered a safe option for traction placement.}

abstract = {Background
Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most prevalent cancer and the sixth most common cause of cancer-related mortalities worldwide. Camrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated moderate efficacy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Lactobacillus paracasei, a probiotic bacterium, has a complementary effect in immunotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the combination of camrelizumab and L. paracasei for advanced ESCC.
Methods
This single-arm, single-center, exploratory trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. Eligible patients received 200 mg camrelizumab biweekly and two bags of L. paracasei twice daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs).
Results
From May 2020 to October 2022, ten patients with advanced ESCC who did not respond to first-line therapy were admitted. At the data cutoff date (August 9, 2023), the median follow-up duration was 12 months. Two of 10 (20%) achieved objective responses. The median survival was 7.5 months and the median OS was not reached. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in two of the 10 patients (20%). No serious treatment-related AEs or deaths occurred.
Conclusions
Camrelizumab combined with L. paracasei showed favorable anticancer activity and may be a viable second-line treatment for patients with ESCC.

abstract = {Background
There are limited data comparing the effectiveness of multidisciplinary severe asthma clinics (SACs) with that of conventional single-discipline clinics (SDCs) for pediatric severe asthma.
Objective
Our aim was to compare asthma outcomes between SACs and SDCs clinics and examine longitudinal health outcomes for patients with severe asthma who were followed in SACs.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing pediatric asthma outcomes among patients with severe asthma between 2018 and 2022 who were treated at the multidisciplinary Arkansas Children's SAC with those of patients with severe asthma treated at SDCs. The primary outcome was acute health care utilization, including hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Secondary outcomes included systemic corticosteroid prescriptions and controller medications. For SAC enrollees, longitudinal outcomes including health care utilization, symptom control, and spirometry were evaluated 12 months before and after enrollment. Data sources included the electronic health record and SAC patient registry.
Results
The study population included 280 patients with severe asthma, aged 5 to 18 years, from the SAC (n = 56) and SDCs (n = 224). The SAC patients were more likely to be Black (79% vs 52% [P = .0002]), be non-Hispanic (100% vs 88% [P = .01]), have had at least 1 hospitalization (21% vs 10% [P = .04]), and have received at least 2 prescriptions for a systemic corticosteroid (34% vs 17% [P = .01]). Longitudinal outcomes among patients for the 12 months before SAC enrollment versus 12 months after SAC enrollment demonstrated significant reductions in acute exacerbations (from 35 to 8 [P < .001]), hospitalizations (from 21 to 1 [P < .001]), and intensive care unit admissions (from 8 to 1 [P = .02]).
Conclusions
The study highlights significant morbidity among predominately Black pediatric patients with severe asthma, particularly those followed in a SAC versus in SDCs at a tertiary care referral center. The findings demonstrate the value of targeted multidisciplinary approaches to reduce asthma utilization and improve outcomes among high-risk patients.}

Avoiding unnecessary radiotherapy (RT) in patients with limited life expectancy requires accurate selection. Traditional survival models based on structured data often lack precision. Large language models (LLMs) offer a novel approach to structuring unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, potentially improving survival predictions by integrating comprehensive clinical information.
Materials and methods
We analyzed structured and unstructured data from 34,276 RT-treated patients at Yonsei Cancer Center. An open-source LLM structured unstructured EHR data using single-shot learning. External validation included 852 patients from Yongin Severance Hospital. We compared the LLM’s performance against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models using statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning approaches incorporated both structured and LLM-structured data.
Results
The open-source LLM structured unstructured EHR data with 87.5 % accuracy, outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM (35.8 %). Larger LLMs were more effective in structuring clinically relevant features, such as general condition and disease extent, which correlated with survival. Incorporating LLM-structured features improved the deep learning model’s C-index from 0.737 to 0.820 (internal validation) and from 0.779 to 0.842 (external validation). Risk stratification was also enhanced, with clearer differentiation among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (p < 0.001). Additionally, models became more interpretable, as key LLM-structured features aligned with statistically significant predictors traditionally identified from structured data.
Conclusion
General-domain LLMs, despite not being fine-tuned for medical data, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHRs, significantly improving survival prediction accuracy and model interpretability. The RT-Surv framework highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance clinical decision-making and optimize RT treatment.}

abstract = {Objectives
To examine the optimal range of steps for an individual based on the dose-response relationship of the number of steps taken with disability incidence and all-cause mortality stratified by age and physical frailty.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
Setting and Participants
8664 community-dwelling older adults.
Methods
The daily number of steps was measured using an accelerometer. Disability incidence and mortality were prospectively determined over 60 months. Participants were stratified using a nonlinear restricted cubic spline based on age ≥75 or <75 years and physical frailty, per the revised Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria.
Results
The study cohort's median age was 74 years [interquartile range (IQR) range 71-78), and 54.0% were female. Incidental disability and death were observed in 1373 (15.8%) and 529 (6.1%) participants, respectively. The median steps per day were 5514 (IQR 3878-7616). Daily steps were nonlinearly associated with disability incidence and mortality. The optimal cutoff points for frail and nonfrail participants were, respectvely, 2168 [hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98] and 7459 (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-0.99) steps for disability incidence and 2593 (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.98) and 3282 (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98) steps for all-cause mortality. The optimal cutoff points for participants >75 and <75 years were, respectively, 6066 (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) and 8573 (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-0.99) steps for disability incidence and 1824 (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98) and 4128 (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99) steps for all-cause mortality.
Conclusions and Implications
Participants ≥75 years and frail participants required lower daily steps for preventing disability incidence and all-cause mortality than those <75 years and nonfrail participants, indicating that lower targets may still provide health-promoting benefits. Thus, the optimal step number should be considered based on individual characteristics, including age and frailty.}

The 21st Century Cures Act final rule requires that patients have real-time access to their radiology reports, which contain technical language. The objective of this study to was to use a novel system called RadGPT, which integrates concept extraction and a large language model (LLM), to help patients understand their radiology reports.
Methods
RadGPT generated 150 concept explanations and 390 question-and-answer pairs from 30 radiology report impressions from between 2012 and 2020. The extracted concepts were used to create concept-based explanations, as well as concept-based question-and-answer pairs for which questions were generated using either a fixed template or an LLM. Additionally, report-based question-and-answer pairs were generated directly from the impression using an LLM without concept extraction. One board-certified radiologist and four radiology residents rated the material quality using a standardized rubric.
Results
Concept-based LLM-generated questions were of significantly higher quality than concept-based template-generated questions (P < .001). Excluding those template-based question-and-answer pairs from further analysis, nearly all (>95%) of RadGPT-generated materials were rated highly, with at least 50% receiving the highest possible ranking from all five raters. No answers or explanations were rated as likely to affect the safety or effectiveness of patient care. Report-level LLM-based questions and answers were rated particularly highly, with 92% of report-level LLM-based questions and 61% of the corresponding report-level answers receiving the highest rating from all raters.
Conclusions
The educational tool RadGPT generated high-quality explanations and question-and-answer pairs that were personalized for each radiology report, unlikely to produce harmful explanations, and likely to enhance patient understanding of radiology information.}

abstract = {Background
Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae. Reliable susceptibility testing is critical but challenging due to colistin’s complex pharmacodynamics and testing limitations. This study evaluates the performance of the Colistin Agar Test (CAT) against the gold standard Broth Microdilution (BMD) method.
Methods
Study was conducted after confirming stability of colistin in agar plate. A total of 150 non-duplicate clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae (103 colistin intermediate, 47 resistant) were tested using both BMD and CAT. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of these isolates was performed using VITEK-2. Quality control was ensured using CLSI-recommended strains. Statistical parameters including Categorical Agreement (CA), Essential Agreement (EA), Major Error (ME), Very Major Error (VME), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Cohen’s Kappa were calculated using BMD as reference.
Results
MICs ranged from 0.125-16 µg/mL (BMD) and 0.125–8 µg/mL (CAT). CA and EA for CAT were 96 % and 87.3 % respectively. ME and VME were 4.8 % and 2.1 %. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CAT were 97.9 %, 95.1 %, 90.1 %, and 98.9 % respectively. Cohen’s Kappa showed almost perfect agreement (0.91).
Conclusion
CAT demonstrated high agreement with BMD and showed promise as a screening tool for colistin susceptibility in K. pneumoniae. While BMD remains the gold standard, CAT offers a feasible alternative for routine use, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, resistant results by CAT should be confirmed with BMD to avoid false resistance reporting and potential therapeutic exclusion of colistin.}

abstract = {Background
Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population. However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology.
Objective
This study aims to design the IoT-based management of infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous infectious disease surveillance.
Methods
The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to achieve the intended goals.
Results
We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5) transforming patient information into surveillance information.
Conclusions
The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions, we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance, and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems, providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.}

Oligo(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether) resins are commonly used owing to their low dielectric constant and high thermal resistance; however, further reduction in dielectric loss tangents is needed for future communication networks. Materials with excellent dielectric properties typically exhibit low polarity and high flammability, presenting a trade-off between dielectric performance and flame retardancy. PMPS-V exhibits thermosetting behavior and an extremely low dielectric-loss tangent (<0.001 at 10 GHz). Owing to its polyphenylene sulfide backbone, PMPS-V meets the UL-94 V-0 flame retardancy standard. Long-term heat resistance testing at 150 °C confirmed minimal degradation in dielectric properties, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. In addition, PMPS-V has a high glass transition temperature and favorable solubility in common solvents such as toluene, making it suitable for printed wiring board applications. These results indicate that PMPS-V is a promising candidate for next-generation low dielectric materials.}

The objective of this study was to assess the complication and re-operation rates, evaluate the risk of non-union, and describe the functional outcomes at last follow-up in children and adolescents after lower-limb malignant tumour resection and reconstruction using the induced-membrane technique.
Hypothesis
Weight-bearing resumption 6 weeks after the second stage of the induced-membrane procedure promotes bone healing.
Material and methods
The study included 13 patients (9 with osteosarcoma, 3 with Ewing's sarcomas, and 1 with alveolar sarcoma) managed between 2000 and 2020 by oncological femoral or tibial resection followed, at a distance from adjuvant chemotherapy, by reconstruction using the induced-membrane technique. Non-union was the primary outcome measure and the MusculoSkeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) lower-limb functional score was the secondary outcome measure. Mean follow-up was 6.1 years (range, 2.0–12.7). At last follow-up, mean age was 18.1 years (range, 11.0–26.0) and the mean MSTS score was 66.6% (37.0–93.0%).
Results
After the second reconstruction stage, 8 complications developed in 6 patients (46%). Either a complication or limb-length inequality required 12 re-operations in 8 patients (61.5%). Non-union occurred after reconstruction in 5 (38.5%) patients. Early resumption of 50% weight-bearing 6 weeks after reconstruction was associated with bone healing (p=0.02).
Conclusion
The non-union rate was 38.5%. Partial, 50% weight-bearing with two elbow crutches and an orthosis, if allowed by construct stability, may promote bone healing.

Therefore, in this study, we developed an automated one-step multigene assembly method for constructing an expression-tunable library based on in vivo homologous recombination. We optimized the shuttle vector for in vivo homologous recombination to improve the assembly efficiency. We also scaled down the whole assembly method for a high-throughput gene assembly.

abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory condition characterised by the formation of granuloma in organs. It can cause end-organ damage and is associated with an elevated risk of mortality [1, 2]. Despite its clinical importance, the epidemiology of sarcoidosis in England is poorly characterised, with a notable lack of published data on its prevalence, and estimates of incidence and mortality that were last calculated two decades ago [3, 4].
Objectives:
This study's objective was to explore contemporary trends in the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of sarcoidosis in England.
Methods:
This research utilised a population-based approach, using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), linking primary care records with secondary care data and death registrations from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Adults aged 18 years or older who contributed data between 2003 and 2023 were included. Sarcoidosis cases were identified through diagnostic codes in primary care records. Age- and sex-standardised incidence and prevalence were calculated. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to compare mortality rates with those of the general population. A control cohort without sarcoidosis was matched within the CPRD, and negative binomial regression was applied to assess differences in all-cause mortality rates between individuals with incident sarcoidosis and their matched counterparts.
Results:
A total of 56,287 patients had a diagnostic code for sarcoidosis between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st 2023. The age and sex-standardised incidence of sarcoidosis was 6.65 per 100,000 person-years in 2003 and 7.73 per 100,000 person-years in 2023 (Figure 1a). Regression demonstrated an annual increase in incidence of 0.10 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 0.06 to 0.14) over the study period. Notable rises in new diagnoses were observed among males and individuals over 60 years old. The prevalence of sarcoidosis using at least one diagnostic code, standardised by age and sex, increased from 168 per 100,000 in 2003 to 231 per 100,000 in 2023. This increase appeared consistent across the study period (Figure 1b). The age-and-sex-standardised all-cause mortality rate among the prevalent population was 9.5 per 1,000 patients in 2003 and 12.2 per 1,000 patients in 2023 (Figure 1c). Over the study period, there was an annual increase in mortality of 0.07 per 1,000 patients (95% CI 0.02 to 0.12). Elevated mortality rates were observed in males [SMR: 1.8 (95% CI: 1.7 to 1.8)] and females [SMR: 2.0 (95% CI: 2.0 to 2.1)], particularly among those aged 30–70 years. Regression models showed significantly higher all-cause mortality in the incident sarcoidosis cohort compared to matched controls [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.73 (95% CI: 1.63 to 1.83)] Figure 1Age and sex standardised incidence, prevalence and mortality of sarcoidosis in England
Conclusion:
The incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis are rising in England, with notable rises amongst males and individuals aged 60 and older. Younger patients with sarcoidosis are at increased risk of death compared to matched controls. Acknowledging the growing burden of this disease, along with shifting demographic trends, is crucial for optimising healthcare policies and ensuring the effective allocation of healthcare resources.

abstract = {The integration of teledermatology and artificial intelligence (AI) marks a significant advancement in dermatologic care. This study examines the synergistic interplay between these two domains, highlighting their collective impact on enhancing the accuracy, accessibility, and efficiency of teledermatologic services. Teledermatology expands dermatologic care to remote and underserved areas, and AI technologies show considerable potential in analyzing dermatologic images and performing various tasks involved in teledermatology consultations. Such integration facilitates rapid, precise diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and data-driven insights. Our explorative study involved designing a GPT-based chatbot named “Dr. DermBot” and exploring its performance in a teledermatologic consultation process. The design phase focused on the chatbot's ability to conduct consultations autonomously. The subsequent testing phase assessed its performance against the backdrop of current teledermatologic practices, exploring the potential of AI and chatbots to simulate and potentially enhance teledermatologic health care. Our study demonstrates the promising future of combining teledermatology with AI. It also brings to light ethical and legal concerns, including the protection of patient data privacy and adherence to regulatory standards. The union of teledermatology and AI not only aims to enhance the precision of teledermatologic diagnoses but also broadens the accessibility of dermatologic services to previously underserved populations, benefiting patients, health care providers, and the overall health care system.}

abstract = {The addition of heavy rare earth elements to sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets through grain boundary diffusion techniques can significantly improve the coercivity of magnets with minimal reduction in remanence. The diffusion depth and distribution of the diffusion source are critical metrics for evaluating the efficiency of the diffusion process. Glow discharge mass spectrometry can sequentially strip layers of the magnet within a limited region to measure the concentration of the diffusion source at various depths. However, the accuracy is compromised by the multiphase nature of the base magnet material and the inhomogeneous distribution of the diffusion source. In contrast, electron probe microanalysis enables direct observation of the diffusion depth and distribution by analyzing diffusion cross-sections of the magnet. Coupled with digital image processing techniques, electron probe microanalysis allows high-throughput analysis of images to calculate concentration across depth intervals, establish depth-concentration relationships, and predict the concentration of heavy rare-earth elements at specific depths. Describing the distribution of diffusion sources presents a significant challenge. In this work, a probabilistic denoising diffusion model is proposed for the first time to quantify the distribution of the diffusion source. EPMA images were segmented into 3,700 distinct positions for model training. The trained model can generate diffusion images with the same distribution of heavy rare-earth elements at any position. By training on microscopic images of various magnets, the model establishes a profound correlation between magnet performance and microstructure, providing practical guidance for optimizing magnets or diffusion sources.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, and newly developed models have demonstrated promising potential, yet their diagnostic performance for critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings remains underexplored. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy, differential diagnosis quality, and response quality in critical illness cases of four newly developed LLMs.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, four newly developed LLMs—ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-V3, and DeepSeek-R1—were evaluated using 50 critical illness cases in ICU settings from published literature. Diagnostic accuracy and response quality were compared across models.
Results
A total of 50 critical illness cases were included. ChatGPT-o3 achieved the top diagnosis accuracy at 72 % (36/50; 95 % CI 0.600–0.840), followed by DeepSeek-R1 at 68 % (34/50; 95 % CI 0.540–0.800), ChatGPT-4o at 64 % (32/50; 95 % CI 0.500–0.760), and DeepSeek-V3 at 32 % (16/50; 95 % CI 0.200–0.460). ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT-4o all significantly outperformed DeepSeek-V3, with no significant differences among the three. The median differential quality score was 5.0 for ChatGPT-o3 (IQR 5.0–5.0; 95 % CI 5.0–5.0), DeepSeek-R1 (IQR 5.0–5.0; 95 % CI 5.0–5.0), and ChatGPT-4o (IQR 4.0–5.0; 95 % CI 4.5–5.0), and 4.0 for DeepSeek-V3 (IQR 3.0–5.0; 95 % CI 4.0–5.0). ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 scored significantly higher than DeepSeek-V3; ChatGPT-4o showed a non-significant trend toward better performance.All models received high Likert ratings for response completeness, clarity, and usefulness. ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT-4o each showed a trend toward better response quality compared to DeepSeek-V3, although no significant differences were observed among the models.
Conclusions
The newly developed models, especially the reasoning models, demonstrated strong potential in supporting diagnosis in critical illness cases in ICU settings. With further domain-specific fine-tuning, their diagnostic accuracy could be further enhanced. Notably, the open-source reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 performed competitively, suggesting strong potential for scalable deployment in resource-limited settings.}

Personal protective equipment is essential to protect healthcare workers when exposed to aerosol-generating procedures in patients with airborne respiratory pathogens.
Aim
This study aimed to provide information regarding the level of airborne protection offered to nursing staff and other healthcare workers in Australian and New Zealand intensive care units (ICUs) 1 year into the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
Methods
In this cross-sectional survey, ICUs in Australia and New Zealand were asked to participate in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group Point Prevalence Program in June 2021. Sites were asked to contribute to questions regarding airborne protection offered to nursing staff and other healthcare workers.
Results
There were 51 participating sites. Negative-pressure bed space availability within participating ICUs included 24 with more than two, 15 with two, eight with one, and one ICU that did not have any. The median (interquartile range) number of different models and sizes of N95/P2 masks available to ICU staff was 6 (4–7). Of the 1018 nursing staff working that day in the units, 799 (78.5%) had at least one fit-tested N95/P2 mask in the correct size available. A total of 712 patients (461 medical and 251 surgical) were cared for by 700 bedside nurses in these ICUs. Overall, adequate airborne protection preparedness (airborne personal protective equipment training and fit-testing since the pandemic) was present in 548 (78.3%) bedside nurses.
Conclusions
Over a year into the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, airborne protection provided to nursing and other healthcare staff in Australia and New Zealand was often inadequate.}

Recent advancements in multimodal AI have shown the potential to solve such complex tasks. This research uses ChatGPT, a type of multimodal AI, to validate the recognition performance of weather map images and proposes prompt engineering for more accurate recognition. Weather map recognition is a problem that is also featured in the Common University Entrance Test. If weather maps can be recognized, automatic grading and question generation become possible, leading to learning support. Furthermore, it is expected that weather commentary text can be automatically generated from weather maps. Therefore, weather map image recognition is an important task, but it requires not only recognizing time-series changes in local weather data but also recognizing information on large-scale weather patterns such as pressure pattern and making future predictions. In this research, we use ChatGPT4-Vision, a multimodal AI, to validate the recognition performance of weather map images. We investigate whether it can answer questions about weather maps from university entrance exams and generate weather commentary text from weather map images. By conducting multiple experiments with varying tasks and information in the prompts, and evaluating the accuracy of the generated commentaries, we propose and validate improvements in reading performance through prompt engineering.}

abstract = {Background
Rural community patients with acute stroke fhave worse outcomes compared to those in urban communities. This study determined the associations between agency type (rural, suburban, urban), patient care (compliance with American Heart Association [AHA] guidelines), and patient outcomes (discharge disposition).
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of patients with prehospital impression of suspected stroke and a final diagnosis of an acute stroke or TIA between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022. Prehospital agencies were classified by rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) score: urban (RUCA 1), suburban (RUCA 2-3), rural (RUCA 4-10). Descriptive statistics characterized the cohort. Multivariable regression analysis tested the association between agency type and discharge disposition while controlling for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, initial NIHSS, in-hospital intervention, and receiving facility type.
Results
Urban-, suburban-, and rural-based agencies varied in compliance with the AHA recommendations. Rural agencies had the lowest proportion of encounters with full compliance (2.0 %) compared to suburban (7.0 %) and urban agencies (11.0 %) (p < 0.01). Compared to patients transported by urban agencies, patients transported by suburban agencies had almost twice (1.78 times; 95 % CI, 1.19-2.65) the odds of discharge to hospice or death and 0.56 times (95 % CI, 0.38-0.84) the odds of discharge home after controlling for covariates.
Conclusions
Rural EMS agencies had the lowest proportion of full compliance with AHA prehospital stroke guidelines. Acute stroke patients transported by suburban EMS agencies were less likely to be discharged home and more likely to be discharged to death compared to patients transported by urban-based EMS agencies.}

The affected fish displayed symptoms including fin ulcers and white spots, which were confirmed through clinical testing conducted at Dalian Ocean University. Microscopic examinations revealed a substantial presence of black dot-like unicellular parasites on the gills of the diseased fish. Further analyses, including methyl green-pyronine staining, optical microscopy, and biological scanning electron microscopy, facilitated the identification of the parasite as Amyloodinium ocellatum. Additionally, bacterial isolation and culture, Gram staining, physiological and biochemical testing, 16S rDNA sequence analysis, phylogenetic tree, and drug sensitivity experiments were performed on the organs of the affected fish. The results identified two dominant bacterial strains, Vibrio scophthalmi and Vibrio harveyi, present in the spleen and kidney of the infected fish. Antibiotic sensitivity tests indicated that V. scophthalmi is susceptible to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, and enrofloxacin, while V. harveyi showed sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, and ofloxacin. In conclusion, this case was determined to be a combined infection involving both parasites and bacteria. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for the prevention and control of epidemics affecting Takifugu rubripes.}

abstract = {Objective
Despite an expanding scope of practice, uptake of advanced clinical services is hindered by pharmacists’ self-efficacy in high-stakes decision-making. Traditional experiential learning builds confidence but is constrained by preceptor shortages, scheduling conflicts, and travel requirements. This study evaluates an artificial intelligence-enabled virtual clinical training program designed to replace in-person warfarin-management rotations.
Methods
This mixed-methods study assessed the impact of the Management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy course on learners’ confidence and satisfaction. The course combines online modules with a virtual clinic that simulates a full clinical rotation, including patient encounters, therapeutic decisions, documentation, and structured feedback. Surveys administered after the online modules and again after completing the virtual clinic captured confidence (5-point Likert) and program satisfaction; free-text responses underwent content analysis.
Results
Of 287 participants (96.9% pharmacists), mean confidence on a 5-point Likert scale increased from baseline (1.92) to post-modules (3.85) and further after the virtual clinic (4.24). Approximately 40% experienced additional gains following simulations. Virtual simulations were ranked the most valuable component (69%). Qualitative analysis yielded 4 themes: experiential consolidation of learning, virtual experience comparable to in-person training, complementary role of preparatory materials, and technical refinements needed.
Conclusion
The artificial intelligence-enabled virtual clinic effectively replaced traditional clinical rotations and enhanced confidence in warfarin care. Graduates’ patients later achieved the highest time in therapeutic range reported in Canadian general practice, supporting real-world impact. The Management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy model may mitigate preceptor shortages and deliver standardized experiential training; broader validation across therapeutic areas and learner groups is warranted.}

A case study is conducted to construct the knowledge graph of BHR under rainstorms in Hong Kong. The performance of the proposed LLMs-empowered knowledge extraction is also validated based on natural language processing metrics and LLMs-based Evaluation (LLMs-Eval). BHR knowledge graph indicates the potential relations between disasters, factors, response actions, and the health status of the building and occupants, and provides insight to guide the BHR enhancement. The superiority of the proposed LLMs-empowered automated knowledge graph construction approach is proven, implying LLMs have great potential in knowledge graph construction, not only for BHR but also for other concepts that require structured knowledge for further explorations and analyses.}

abstract = {Background
Currarino syndrome is a rare congenital condition characterized by a triad of anorectal malformation, sacral agenesis, and presacral mass, often a teratoma. Comparative outcomes of sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) in Currarino versus non-syndromic cases are not well defined.
Methods
A multicenter retrospective review of pediatric SCT resections from 2010 to 2020 was conducted across 11 institutions in the Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of Currarino syndrome. Demographic, surgical, pathologic, and long-term outcome data were analyzed. The primary outcome was tumor recurrence.
Results
Of 203 patients, 25 (12.3 %) had Currarino syndrome. Currarino patients were more often diagnosed postnatally (80 % vs. 25 %, p < 0.001) and had predominantly Altman type IV tumors (87 % vs. 17 %, p < 0.001). All tumors in the Currarino cohort were mature teratomas, while 27 % of non-Currarino tumors were immature and 12 % were malignant (p < 0.001). Tumors in Currarino patients were significantly smaller in size (median 3.3 cm vs. 8.0 cm, p < 0.001). Recurrence rates were low and comparable (4 % Currarino vs. 10 % non-Currarino, p = 0.18). Currarino patients had higher rates of urinary incontinence (44 % vs. 28 %, p = 0.048) and constipation (76 % vs. 32 %, p < 0.001). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a trend toward improved recurrence-free survival in Currarino patients, though not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Pediatric patients with Currarino-associated SCTs have excellent long-term outcomes, with low recurrence rates likely attributable to benign tumor histology and high rates of complete resection. These findings suggest that surveillance strategies may be tailored for Currarino patients to reduce unnecessary imaging and long-term follow-up burden.

keywords = {Endodontic education, Large language models, Multimodal knowledge base, Retrieval Augmented Generation},
abstract = {Background
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge in medical education. In dental specialties such as endodontics, effective learning requires access to both textual clinical evidence and visual procedural demonstrations. However, generic LLMs often produce content that lacks clinical accuracy, contextual grounding, or pedagogical clarity, thereby limiting their applicability in specialized training environments.
Objective
To develop and evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced LLMs framework that addresses the challenge of integrating domain-specific knowledge in AI-driven endodontic education.
Method
We present Endodontics-KB, a multimodal knowledge integration platform that combines evidence-based dental literature (e.g., textbooks, clinical guidelines) with visual instructional materials (e.g., procedural videos) through a hierarchical RAG architecture. The system’s core component, the EndoQ chatbot, utilizes LLMs augmented with multimodal dental datasets to enable context-aware clinical reasoning. Benchmarking was conducted against three general-purpose LLMs: GPT-4, Qwen2.5, and DeepSeek R1, using a structured question bank comprising 11 expert-validated endodontic questions. Two domain experts performed a blinded evaluation across five performance dimensions: clinical accuracy, contextual relevance, completeness, decision-making professionalism, and communication fluency.
Results
The framework integrated 2,200 multimodal knowledge units through dynamic semantic indexing. EndoQ demonstrated statistically significant improvements across all evaluation metrics compared to general purpose LLMs: accuracy (4.45 ± 0.96), clinical relevance (4.59 ± 0.8), completeness (4.27 ± 0.83), professionalism judgment (4.45 ± 1.06), and language fluency (4.86 ± 0.47), as measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
Conclusion
This proposed framework improves educational outcomes through precise and context-aware knowledge delivery. Furthermore, it represents a scalable and transferable model for AI-enhanced clinical training across medical specialties, significantly advancing competency-based pedagogy in dental education.}

Today’s students seek education that is flexible, personalized, and closely aligned with their career goals. Curricular flexibility supports learner-centered education, promotes adaptability, and empowers students by shifting some decision-making from faculty to learners. Important nuances must be considered, including the type of flexibility applied and the degree to which learning can be made accessible and adaptable. Literature highlights several benefits, such as fostering self-reflection, promoting engagement, supporting well-being, and encouraging greater accountability for learning. However, barriers exist, including concerns about increased faculty workload, limited direct evidence of positive student outcomes, and the possibility of creating academic entitlement. The purpose of this commentary is to describe elements of curricular flexibility and present examples from higher education and health professions literature that can be implemented at the program level or within individual courses. Successful implementation requires thoughtful consideration of where structure remains essential and where intentional opportunities can be introduced to foster learner accountability and autonomy. Curricular flexibility is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and faculty should assess the feasibility and support provided at the institutional and program levels. Research within pharmacy education is needed to clarify the impact of flexible learning and identify additional ways to overcome the barriers described. By balancing flexibility with academic rigor and professional standards, educators can better prepare learners to work in a society that values autonomy and adaptability and offers multiple paths to success.}

abstract = {Background
Managing symptoms of chronic pancreatitis (CP) remains a significant challenge. Korean Red ginseng (KRG), a well-known herbal supplement, has shown potential benefits in various health conditions, prompting its investigation in CP patients.
Methods
We conducted a single-arm, prospective clinical trial to evaluate the effect of KRG on quality of life in CP patients exhibiting mild symptoms, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score of 0 or 1. 40 patients were enrolled and assessed at baseline, as well as at 30, 90, and 180 days. The primary outcome was an improvement in CGI scores, with secondary outcomes including changes in Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency Questionnaire (PEI-Q) scores.
Results
A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study, and 39 participants were analyzed. Results showed significant improvements in CGI scores at all examined intervals (days 0–30, 0–90, 0–180; p < 0.05). The PEI-Q score also significantly improved from day 0 to day 180 (p < 0.05). Two adverse events (AEs) probably related to KRG were reported, and all AEs were improved with conservative managements.
Conclusion
KRG supplementation significantly improves quality of life in CP patients with mild symptoms. These findings suggest that KRG may be a beneficial adjunct therapy in this patient population. Further research is needed to explore KRG’s pharmacological mechanisms, its use in combination with other treatments, and its effects in patients with more severe symptoms.

Against the backdrop of explosive growth in galaxy observation data, how to quickly identify the number of spiral arms has become an important issue in the study of spiral galaxies. The research is based on the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey) dataset and studies the ResNet (Residual Networks) model's method of identifying the number of spiral arms from spiral galaxy images. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the ResNet32 model is 83%, which is the best compared to network models such as ViT (Vision Transformer), EfficientNet, and DenseNet. In terms of recognition of different numbers of spiral arms, there is a strong relationship between recognition accuracy and the number of training samples. There are 6800 images with 2 spiral arms, with an F1-Score value of 0.9, while there are only 237 images with 4 spiral arms, with the lowest F1-Score value. The experiment further analyzed the recognition effect of fused traditional galaxy image features and found that the role of fused traditional galaxy image features in improving the recognition of spiral arms is limited.}

Its scope in treating patients with colorectal cancer is reviewed. A search was performed to include a breadth of digital technologies, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), mobile health, and simulation. Many digital roles were identified in the 60 studies included. These were clinician-facing or patient-facing throughout the patient’s journey (screening, preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative) and involved the broader team (trainees, oncology, pathology). Colorectal cancer screening was improved via the use of digital technology, including virtual health assistants. Preoperative patient-facing VR enhances consent and reduces perioperative anxiety. For surgeons, enhanced awareness of vascular and visceral anatomy relative to the tumour helped with surgical planning, with the emerging concepts of ‘virtual colectomy’ and ‘digital clone’. Pathologically, AI more accurately predicts lymph node metastasis following endoscopic polyp cancer excision, thus reducing over-treatment with surgery, and assesses the response to neoadjuvant treatment to guide selective surgery. Intraoperatively, AI facilitates real-time detection of anatomical landmarks, including autonomic nerves, ureters, and areolar tissue, to indicate the dissection plane. These intraoperative studies lacked a control group and outcome reporting (intraoperative, clinical, oncological, or functional), highlighting that this technology requires further development and study. There is a paucity of evidence regarding AR, such as intraoperative holographic overlay. Postoperative patient-facing digital technology can promote enhanced recovery, improve physical activity, and reduce sick-role maladaptation. For clinicians, AI can predict the short-term (complications) and long-term (survival) patient prognosis. VR could play an increasing role in training, with some evidence from validated virtual curricula. In summary, digital surgery has potential applications throughout the patient journey and along the virtuality continuum, showing advantages over conventional approaches in the preoperative and postoperative phases. Intraoperative, AI and AR methods have not yet been shown to have clinically significant advantages. As its scope grows, there are emerging implications for training, regulation, and ethics.}

abstract = {Background
Rural individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) experience challenges to anticoagulation adherence and self-management of the condition. We tested an intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, quality of life, and health care utilization in rural individuals with AF.
Methods
We randomized rural patients with AF receiving anticoagulation to receive a smartphone-based relational agent (for disease education and adherence guidance) and a heart rate and rhythm monitor for 4 months or a smartphone-based health education app. Adherence was determined with 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC), and secondary outcomes of quality of life and health care utilization from interviews and health records.
Results
The trial randomized 270 individuals 1:1 (median [IQR] age 73.1 [67.5–78.6]; 163 [60.4 %] female sex). Over the 4-month intervention, intervention participants used the relational agent a median of 101 (IQR: 72, 110) days. In an intention-to-treat analysis there was no significant difference in 12-month PDC between the intervention and control groups (median [IQR]: intervention 0.97 [0.89–1.00] versus control 0.97 [0.92–1.00]) or in PDC ≥0.80. Intervention participants were more likely to self-report anticoagulation adherence than control at 4 and 8 months (95.7 % vs 88.4 % and 93.0 % vs 78.8 %, respectively) but not at 12 months. There were no significant differences by assigned intervention for the other secondary outcomes.
Conclusions
Randomization to the relational agent intervention was not associated with improved PDC at 12-months but with greater interim self-reported adherence compared to a control. This study demonstrates the successful use of a smartphone-based agent to address adherence among rural individuals with AF.}

abstract = {Introduction
Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) of the prostate uses ultrasound to thermally coagulate tissue under real-time MRI guidance. Real-time feedback from closed-loop MRI thermometry automatically controls treatment parameters to match tissue response in the prescribed ablation volume. The pivotal study of TULSA (“TACT”, NCT02766543), which included a low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) population, has reached the end of the 5-year follow-up duration. Here we report the safety and efficacy outcomes at 5 years
Methods
The TACT study enrolled 115 patients across 13 sites in 5 countries. Eligibility criteria included stage ≤ T2b, PSA ≤ 15 ng/mL, and Grade Group (GG) 1-2 disease. The protocol prescribed a single whole-gland TULSA treatment sparing the prostatic urethra and urinary sphincter, and repeat TULSA was not allowed. The primary endpoints were PSA reduction and adverse events, both assessed at 1 year. Histologic control on 10-core biopsy, and prostate volume reduction on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) were also assessed at 1 year. Other secondary endpoints, assessed to 5 years, included adverse events, quality of life, PSA, and the rate of salvage treatment.
Results
Baseline (median [IQR]) age and PSA were 65 (59-69) years and 6.3 (4.6-7.9) ng/mL, with ≥GG2 disease in 72/115 men. At 1y, median prostate volume decreased from 37.3 to 2.8 cc (92%); 94/111 (85%) were free of ≥GG2 disease. By 5y, median (IQR) PSA decreased to 0.6 (0.18-1.9) ng/mL (n=68); 25 (21.7%) received salvage treatment (10 prostatectomy, 11 radiotherapy, 3 ADT, 1 surgery+radiation) without unexpected complications. Early predictors of treatment failure by 5 years included 1y PSA (OR=3; CI[1.7,5.4]) and visible lesion on 1y mpMRI (OR=12; CI[4.4,34]) (both p≤0.001). Failure modes include undertreatment due to patient selection or targeting error, and misalignment caused by intraprocedural swelling/motion. By 5 years, 61/66 (92%) recovered pad-free continence; 80/92 (87%) preserved erections sufficient for penetration. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 12 men (10%), with no Grade≥4 event or rectal injury.
Conclusions
Effective disease control is durable to 5 years after a single TULSA procedure, with a favorable safety profile. Favorable preservation of genitourinary quality of life is also durable to 5 years. Treatment failure modes include screening and intraprocedural factors. While the pivotal study represents early experience with TULSA, the risk of failure is mitigated by modern protocols. Such protocols include best practices for screening for intraprostatic calcifications that can lead to undertreatment, refined strategies for device positioning, and thermal dose escalation to address undertreatment that is visible on intraprocedural imaging. Factors from intraprocedural imaging and early clinical follow-up can predict salvage therapy by 5 years.}

Per current resuscitation guidelines, patients with initial core temperatures <30 °C were considered hypothermic; temperatures between 35 °C and 38 °C were classified as normothermic. We excluded patients with initial temperatures recorded >30 min after arrival. We compared survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge and survival with good neurologic status (i.e., Modified Rankin Scale ≤2) for hypothermic and normothermic patients. Sensitivity analyses explored alternate hypothermia cut-points (< 35 °C; 28 °C).
Results
The primary analysis included 22 hypothermic and 416 normothermic patients. Outcomes for hypothermic and normothermic patients did not significantly differ: survival to hospital admission was 13.6 % vs. 28.6 % (difference −15 %, CI: −30.0 %; +0.01 %); survival to hospital discharge was 4.6 % vs. 3.1 % (difference + 1.4 %, CI: −4.2 %; +13.3 %); survival with good neurologic status was 4.6 % vs. 1.2 % (difference + 3.4 %, CI: −5.4 %; +12.1 %). Using alternative cut-points to define hypothermia did not meaningfully alter the results.
Conclusion
In this analysis, outcomes did not differ for hypothermic and normothermic adult OOHCA patients “found down” following unwitnessed OOHCA who required continued chest compressions in the ED.}

The study of complex adaptive systems, pioneered in physics, biology, and the social sciences, offers important lessons for artificial intelligence (AI) governance. Contemporary AI systems and the environments in which they operate exhibit many of the properties characteristic of complex systems, including nonlinear growth patterns, emergent phenomena, and cascading effects that can lead to catastrophic failures. Complex systems science can help illuminate the features of AI that pose central challenges for policymakers, such as feedback loops induced by training AI models on synthetic data and the interconnectedness between AI systems and critical infrastructure. Drawing on insights from other domains shaped by complex systems, including public health and climate change, we examine how efforts to govern AI are marked by deep uncertainty. To contend with this challenge, we propose three desiderata for designing a set of complexity-compatible AI governance principles comprised of early and scalable intervention, adaptive institutional design, and risk thresholds calibrated to trigger timely and effective regulatory responses.}

However, stable bone fixation is crucial for successful fusion and to prevent complications like non-union. While early approaches focused on minimally invasive techniques to preserve the fibula's vascular network, stable internal fixation has become favored in preventing complications. This article aims to systematically describe bone fixation options for vascularized fibula grafts in the upper limb based on extensive experience, recommending internal fixation over external methods, such as long plates for humerus reconstruction. Different osteotomy techniques are discussed, including intramedullary, transverse, and step cut, with considerations for biomechanics and patient demographics.

Creative problem-solving methods, in particular, present an intriguing means of researching AI’s capacity to identify problems within ambiguous situations, while also generating relevant, useful solutions that respond to authentic, real-world issues in a meaningful way. This paper examined the performance of three separate AI entries generated by GPT-4o as compared with 68 human team entries from students in grades 7–9 within the competitive World Solutions Challenge offered by the Future Problem Solving Program International (FPSPI). The three entries were blind-scored by trained human evaluators for measures of effectiveness, impact, humaneness, creative strength, and development of action plan. Though all three AI entries scored in the top 15 % for all measures, including achieving the top scores for effectiveness, impact, humaneness, development of action plan, and overall performance, the AI entries were not found to be significantly different than the student control group on the measure of creative strength. The results suggest that AI models like GPT-4 may approach human-like abilities on certain aspects of creative performance during a more comprehensive creative process than divergent thinking alone, providing new insight into the current creative strengths—and limitations—of existing AI models.}

Literature examining the impact of obesity on burn injury remains mixed. Previous examination of the National Burn Repository, now the BCQP, in obesity-related burn research is limited. The aim of this work was to provide an assessment of the BCQP dataset to examine the effect of obesity on burn-related outcomes.
Materials and Methods
A retrospective review of the BCQP dataset from 2015–2018 was conducted. The primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcomes included overall length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and total hospital costs. Patients were grouped as obese or non-obese and were further stratified by total body surface area burned (TBSA) for comparison purposes. Multiple logistic regression (MLG) was used to compare the effect of several independent variables on mortality, ICU LOS > 7days, hospital LOS > 10 days, and total hospital costs > $200,000.
Results
Of 41,031 patients in the analysis, 3845 (9.37 %) were obese. Obese patients had a higher mean TBSA (p = 0.01), longer overall LOS (p < 0.001), ICU LOS (p < 0.001), and total hospital costs (p < 0.001). MLG found obesity to be an independent predictor of ICU LOS > 7 days, hospital LOS > 10 days, and total hospital costs > $200,000. Obesity was not an independent predictor of mortality in burn patients, even when stratified by burn size.
Conclusions
The presence of obesity in this dataset was not found to be a predictor of mortality for any burn size, but was a predictor of overall LOS, ICU LOS, and total hospital costs. Including obesity-related variables in databases may improve analysis in obesity-related burn research.}

abstract = {Purpose
Hand and wrist trauma is a frequent cause of emergency room (ER) visits. However, hospitals often lack immediate hand specialist coverage. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms like ChatGPT in aiding in the diagnosis and patient management of upper extremity trauma.
Methods
Ten clinical vignettes depicting common hand and wrist emergency clinical situations were created by the senior author to represent a broad range of common upper extremity injuries. These were presented to plastic surgery residents and ChatGPT (version 4.0). The responder was tasked to provide a diagnosis, ER management, and definitive treatment plans for each vignette. Responses were collected and scored by two attending plastic surgeons, blinded to the source, on a scale of 0 (poor) to 30 (excellent). Univariate and linear regression models were utilized for analysis.
Results
A total of 16 resident responses (9 junior and 7 senior) and 16 ChatGPT responses were collected for each of the 10 clinical scenarios. ChatGPT had significantly higher total average scores (mean = 26.6 vs. 22.7, p < 0.05) and ER management scores (mean = 9.9 vs. 6.7, p < 0.05) when compared to residents. We did not find any notable differences in diagnosis or definitive treatment scores between residents and ChatGPT responses. However, the study was not sufficiently powered to detect smaller effect sizes in these areas. No apparent correlations between scores and resident year of training were observed.
Conclusions
ChatGPT provided clinically accurate diagnosis and management plans for upper extremity trauma. Implementing AI in trauma management has the potential to improve the management of hand and wrist trauma in emergency settings by serving as a diagnostic and clinical reference tool for emergency medical providers. However, their integration into clinical practice should be carefully evaluated and focused on complementing, and not replacing, traditional consults. Ultimately, these tools could alleviate the burden placed on ERs and limit reliance on hand consults.}

In modern industrial and technological applications and collaborative edge intelligence, control systems are crucial for ensuring efficiency and safety. However, deficiencies in these systems can lead to significant operational risks. This paper uses edge intelligence to address the challenges of achieving target speeds and improving efficiency in vehicle control, particularly the limitations of traditional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in managing nonlinear and time-varying dynamics, such as varying road conditions and vehicle behavior, which often result in substantial discrepancies between desired and actual speeds, as well as inefficiencies due to manual parameter adjustments. The paper uses edge intelligence to propose a novel PID control algorithm that integrates Backpropagation (BP) neural networks to enhance robustness and adaptability. The BP neural network is first trained to capture the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. The trained network is then combined with the PID controller to form a hybrid control strategy. The output layer of the neural network directly adjusts the PID parameters (kp, ki, kd), optimizing performance for specific driving scenarios through self-learning and weight adjustments. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our BP neural network-based PID design significantly outperforms traditional methods, with the response time for acceleration from 0 to 1 m/s improved from 0.25 s to just 0.065 s. Furthermore, real-world tests on an intelligent vehicle show its ability to make timely adjustments in response to complex road conditions, ensuring consistent speed maintenance and enhancing overall system performance.}

The purpose of this study was to reconstruct 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images from single anteroposterior (AP) postoperative total hip arthroplasty (THA) X-ray images using a deep learning algorithm known as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and to validate the accuracy of cup angle measurement on GAN-generated CT.
Methods
We used 2 GAN-based models, CycleGAN and X2CT-GAN, to generate 3D CT images from X-ray images of 386 patients who underwent primary THAs using a cementless cup. The training dataset consisted of 522 CT images and 2,282 X-ray images. The image quality was validated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index measure. The cup anteversion and inclination measurements on the GAN-generated CT images were compared with the actual CT measurements. Statistical analyses of absolute measurement errors were performed using Mann–Whitney U tests and nonlinear regression analyses.
Results
The study successfully achieved 3D reconstruction from single AP postoperative THA X-ray images using GANs, exhibiting excellent peak signal-to-noise ratio (37.40) and structural similarity index measure (0.74). The median absolute difference in radiographic anteversion was 3.45° and the median absolute difference in radiographic inclination was 3.25°, respectively. Absolute measurement errors tended to be larger in cases with cup malposition than in those with optimal cup orientation.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of GANs for 3D reconstruction from single AP postoperative THA X-ray images to evaluate cup orientation. Further investigation and refinement of this model are required to improve its performance.}

abstract = {Background
Limited evidence is available comparing the modified transtibial (MTT) and transportal (TP) techniques in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and their impact on returning to sports participation. The objective was to analyze the outcomes after arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL in recreational athletes with a 2-year postoperative follow-up, comparing the MTT and TP techniques, based on the method used to drill the femoral tunnel.
Hypotesis
The rate of return to sport would be comparable regardless of the surgical technique used.
Material and methods
A retrospective study was conducted with 66 patients who underwent arthroscopic monofascicular ACL reconstruction between September 2016 and March 2020. Patients aged between 16 and 50 years old, recreational athletes at Tegner levels 6 and 7, with a 2-year follow-up were included. Groups were established for comparative analysis (MTT vs TP) based on the method for drilling the femoral tunnel. The main outcome variable was the return to sport at the same level. Secondary variables included patient satisfaction evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and knee function according to the Lysholm scale.
Results
At 2 years of postoperative follow-up, the return to sport rate was 30.3 % in the MTT group and 33.3 % in the TP group (p = 0.791). There were no significant differences between both groups in patient satisfaction (p = 0.664) and knee function (p = 0.113).
Conclusion
Drilling the femoral tunnel with the MTT and TP techniques did not influence the rate of return to sport, patient satisfaction, and knee function in recreational athletes with 2 years of postoperative follow-up.

This study examines whether artificial intelligence promotes shared prosperity among service industry enterprises based on microdata of listed companies in the Chinese service industry from 2008 to 2022. The main research results indicate that the application of artificial intelligence in the service industry significantly reduces enterprises' labor income share. The main mechanisms of action include the employment structure effect of squeezing out low-educated and frontline workers and the wage-productivity effect that improves labor productivity but benefits capital income, leading to an unequal income distribution. Research has found that improving the integration of regional labor markets and workers' bargaining power can help alleviate the negative effects of artificial intelligence applications on the share of labor income in the service industry. This study helps developing countries, such as China, manage the impact of the widespread application of artificial intelligence on the labor market in the service industry and provides important policy insights for achieving common prosperity.}

Systematic reviews require substantial time and effort. This study compared the results of conducting reviews by human reviewers with those conducted with Artificial Intelligence (AI). We identified 11 AI-tools that could assist in conducting a systematic review. None of the AI-tools could retrieve all articles that were detected with a manual search strategy. We identified tools for deduplication but did not evaluate them. AI screening tools assist the human reviewer in presenting the most relevant article on top, which could reduce the number of articles that need to be screened on title and abstract and on full text. There was a poor inter-rater reliability to evaluate risk of bias between AI-tools and the human reviewers. A summary table created by AI-tools differs substantially from manually constructed summary tables. This study highlights the potential of AI-tools to support systematic reviews, particularly during screening phases, but not to replace human reviews.}

However, the rapid evolution of Agentic AI, including Generative AI (GenAI) agents, has outpaced a cohesive understanding of its applications, challenges, and strategic implications. This narrative review explores the role of Agentic AI in shaping an intelligent future, focusing on its key attributes—autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and learning ability—and its potential to transform organizational performance. We identify a research gap in synthesizing the diverse capabilities of Agentic AI (e.g., multimodal processing, hierarchical architectures, and machine learning outsourcing) and providing actionable strategies for adoption. The paper examines how Agentic AI enables autonomous decision-making, automates processes, and enhances efficiency through tools like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and AutoGPT. It highlights the transition from assisted ("Copilot") to autonomous ("Autopilot") models and the importance of hierarchical agent structures for system coordination. Key contributions include a framework for organizations to formulate GenAI strategies, addressing business needs, tool selection, human resource training, and risk management. Findings reveal that Agentic AI significantly improves productivity, reduces costs, and drives innovation, though challenges such as privacy, security, and ethical concerns remain. Future research should focus on industry-specific case studies to deepen understanding, explore the ethical and social impacts (e.g., privacy, data security, labor market effects), and investigate the integration of Agentic AI with emerging technologies like quantum computing. This review provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners to leverage Agentic AI effectively while addressing its limitations and opportunities.}

Children and young people (CYP) with cerebral palsy (CP) may have multiple associated co-morbidities, including sleep disorders. Sleep disorders, including sleep disordered breathing, are more prevalent among CYP with CP compared to typically developing children due to several contributory factors. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) collectively represents several different pathologies, namely obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), central sleep apnoea (CSA), and hypoventilation. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to each of these pathologies. Sleep studies (either as polysomnography or cardiorespiratory polygraphy) allow the detection of effort and apnoea, with contemporaneous measurement of oxygen saturations (SpO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcpCO2). Together these enable the diagnosis of SDB, and the delineation of OSA, CSA and/or hypoventilation. The multifactorial component of SDB among CYP with CP may require intervention ranging from conservative measures (e.g. nasopharyngeal airway, soft collar), surgical options (e.g. adenotonsillectomy), or the initiation of respiratory support. Respiratory support, delivered as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), has a key role in the management of SDB in children with CP though the journey can often be turbulent with a high failure rate. Nonetheless, CYP with CP are being increasingly commenced on respiratory support, often for reasons others than SDB, for example aiding airway clearance in order to reduce the frequency of lower respiratory tract infections. Open discussions between the parents and healthcare professionals are important in setting shared goals for CYP with CP, guided by the primary aim of improving quality of life.}

Recent work suggests that human use of personalized AI models, trained on a user's past work, can increase credit attributions to the human user for achieving beneficial text-based outputs. We investigated whether this effect extends to visual artistic outputs and further examined the relationship between credit attribution and aesthetic appreciation. Across two studies (N=774), UK participants evaluated identical paintings that were described as being created either by hand, with a standard text-to-image generative AI system, or with an AI system personalized to the artist. Personalization significantly improved both achievement credit and authorship attribution towards the human user compared to standard AI use. However, it failed to enhance either aesthetic appreciation of the image itself or willingness to categorise the output as "true art"—revealing a striking disconnect between judgments of artistic contribution and artistic value. Our findings suggest that although personalized AI may help bridge the "achievement gap" in credit attribution not only for written works, as demonstrated previously, but also for artistic visual images, it cannot overcome fundamental barriers to aesthetic appreciation of AI art. This challenges assumptions about the relationship between artistic input and aesthetic value, with implications for understanding art categorization and human-AI cooperation in creative pursuits.}

Traditional manual design process is costly and time-consuming, while optimization methods heavily depend on expert knowledge. Recent advancements in deep generative models present promising alternatives. However, their application to the generation of prefabricated construction site layouts is hindered by several challenges, including limited datasets, significant overlap between facilities, and the necessity to generate layouts based on fixed facilities with specific attributes such as minimal transportation costs. These challenges constrain the efficacy and applicability of the generated layouts. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative automated generative design system for prefabricated construction site layouts, leveraging a novel Transformer-based conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). The data preparation module of the system collects and augments layout data for training. The CSLGAN module is designed to generate layouts that conform to spatial constraints and desired attributes, with minimal facility overlap. Furthermore, this study establishes benchmarks in terms of model capacity and specialized performance metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in automated construction site layout generation.}

abstract = {Importance
Large language models (LLMs) hold potential in clinical decision-making, especially for complex and rare disease diagnoses. However, real-world applications require further evaluation for accuracy and utility.
Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of four LLMs (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, ERNIE, and Llama-3) using real-world inpatient medical records and assess the impact of different prompt engineering methods.
Method
This single-center, retrospective study was conducted at Peking University International Hospital. It involved 1,122 medical records categorized into common rheumatic autoimmune diseases, rare rheumatic autoimmune diseases, and non-rheumatic diseases. Four LLMs were evaluated using two prompt engineering methods: few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting. Diagnostic accuracy (hit1) was defined as the inclusion of the first final diagnosis from the medical record in the model’s top prediction.
Results
Hit1 of four LLMs were as follows: GPT-4omini (81.8 %), GPT-4o (82.4 %), ERNIE (82.9 %) and Llama-3 (82.7 %). Few-shot prompting significantly improved GPT-4o’s hit1 (85.9 %) compared to its base model (p = 0.02), outperforming other models (all p < 0.05). Chain-of-thought prompting showed no significant improvement. Hit1 for both common and rare rheumatic diseases was consistently higher than that for non-rheumatic disease. Few-shot prompting increased costs per correct diagnosis for GPT-4o by approximately ¥4.54.
Conclusions
LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrate promising diagnostic accuracy on real medical records. Few-shot prompting enhances performance but at higher costs, underscoring the need for accuracy improvements and cost management. These findings inform LLM development in Chinese medical contexts and highlight the necessity for further multi-center validation.}

Several fields including e-commerce, education, and hospitality are increasingly exploring GPT tools to study user reviews and gain critical insights to improve their service quality. However, massive user-review data and imprecise prompt engineering lead to biased, irrelevant, and impersonal search results. In addition, exposing user data to these search engines may pose privacy issues. Motivated by these factors, we present ChatReview, a ChatGPT-enabled natural language processing (NLP) framework that effectively studies domain-specific user reviews to offer relevant and personalized search results at multiple levels of granularity. The framework accomplishes this task using four phases including data collection, tokenization, query construction, and response generation. The data collection phase involves gathering domain-specific user reviews from public and private repositories. In the tokenization phase, ChatReview applies sentiment analysis to extract keywords and categorize them into various sentiment classes. This process creates a token repository that best describes the user sentiments for a given user-review data. In the query construction phase, the framework uses the token repository and domain knowledge to construct three types of ChatGPT prompts including explicit, implicit, and creative. In the response generation phase, ChatReview pipelines these prompts into ChatGPT to generate search results at varying levels of granularity. We analyze our framework using three real-world domains including education, local restaurants, and hospitality. We assert that our framework simplifies prompt engineering for general users to produce effective results while minimizing the exposure of sensitive user data to search engines. We also present a one-of-a-kind Large Language Model (LLM) peer assessment of the ChatReview framework. Specifically, we employ Google’s Bard to objectively and qualitatively analyze the various ChatReview outputs. Our Bard-based analyses yield over 90% satisfaction, establishing ChatReview as a viable survey analysis tool.}

When reflow soldering was performed for a relatively long time, coarse solder microstructures and interfacial intermetallic compound (IMC) grains were formed. Laser and IPL soldering, which have rapid heating/cooling times, formed fine solder microstructure and thin interfacial IMCs. Then, it was confirmed that Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs were formed at the SAC305/OSP (organic solderability preservative) interface and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, Ni–Sn–P, and Ni3P were formed at the SAC305/ENEPIG (electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold) interface. An observation of the IMC grain morphology under various soldering conditions revealed that (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was formed on the ENEPIG substrate, which was polygonal and smaller than on the OSP substrate. The shear strength of the joint increased in the order of reflow, laser, and IPL soldering. Additionally, ductile fractures occurred under all conditions. The IPL soldering joint had a thinner IMC compared to reflow soldering, and moderate interface roughness and bonding area compared to laser soldering. Based on the obtained results, a next-generation IPL soldering method is proposed to improve the properties of Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder joints.}

This study evaluated the accuracy and comprehensibility of responses from three large language models (LLMs)—ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot—when addressing patient queries about myopia. Accurate, understandable information is crucial for effective patient education and management of this common refractive error.
Methods
Sixty questions across six categories (definition, etiology, symptoms and diagnosis, myopia control, correction, and new treatments) were presented to ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot. Responses were assessed for accuracy by two experienced ophthalmologists using a 3-point Likert scale. Quality and reliability were evaluated using the DISCERN and EQIP scales, while readability was measured with the Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Coleman-Liau Index. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.
Results
ChatGPT-4 provided the most accurate responses in the defsinition, symptoms, and diagnosis categories, with a 75 % overall success rate. Copilot had a similar success rate of 73.3 % but the highest inaccuracy rate (6.7 %). Gemini had a 71.7 % success rate. Copilot scored highest in reliability (DISCERN 76) and readability (Flesch Reading Ease 46.74), followed by ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. No significant differences in accuracy were found among the LLMs across categories.
Conclusions
All three LLMs performed well in providing myopia-related information. Copilot excelled in readability and reliability despite a higher inaccuracy rate. ChatGPT-4 and Copilot outperformed Gemini, likely due to their advanced architectures and training methodologies. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in patient education and the need for ongoing improvements to ensure accurate, comprehensible AI-generated health information.}

Although groundbreaking performances of large language models (LLMs) have inspired many researchers to consider an LLM as a potential BIM control method using natural language, a specific method of utilizing LLMs for automated BIM model detailing has not yet been proposed. This paper proposes an LLM-BIM chaining framework to enable architectural design detailing using natural language, instead of using menu-based user interfaces, named “Natural-language-based Architectural Detailing through Interaction with AI (NADIA)”. The NADIA framework is based on three main approaches: 1) separating the specification of the wall layers from the creation of the wall layers; 2) appropriate instruction prompting to guide the LLM to minimize irrational responses and produce engineering rational details; and 3) LLM-BIM chaining to seamlessly link a BIM authoring tool and an LLM. The effectiveness of NADIA was validated based on two main aspects: its accuracy in generating details that adhere to specified design requirements from users—as a design assistant—and its compliance with general engineering requirements—as a design consultant. The validation was achieved through tasks that involved generating 240 and 1,920 exterior wall details, respectively. NADIA achieved an average accuracy of 83.33% in generating logically coherent details in line with the required design conditions. For thermal performance requirements, it demonstrated a mean accuracy of 98.54% in complying with the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 20.1–2019 standard. Despite being in its early stages, NADIA’s potential for developing and refining architectural details through natural language-based interactions between architects and machines is promising.}

Patients
Adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS treated with an ECMO system in our center between March 2020 and March 2023.
Interventions
Retrospective collection of variables during hospital admission and follow-up.
Main Variables of Interest
Demographic variables, clinical history, variables related to ECMO therapy, COVID-19 wave number, in-hospital mortality, adverse events, ICU and hospital length of stay, and functional status at follow-up were collected.
Results
Eighty-one patients were included. Of these, 61 patients (75%) died during hospitalization. Patients who died were older and had more comorbidities. During the second, third, and sixth waves, mortality was higher. In the multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of mortality was age (OR 1.24 95% CI (1.027–1.5, P = 0.025). After discharge, 40% of patients had difficulties returning to normal life due to respiratory failure requiring oxygen and arthropathies.
Conclusion
In-hospital mortality increased during the pandemic. Older age was the only independent predictor of mortality. After discharge, no deaths were recorded during the first 18 months of follow-up, although 40% of surviving patients had respiratory and motor sequelae making it difficult for them to return to a normal life.
Resumen
Objetivo
Analizar nuestra experiencia con la terapia de soporte con membrana de oxigenación extracorpórea (ECMO) para tratar el síndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo (SDRA) durante la pandemia de COVID-19.
Diseño
Estudio retrospectivo y observacional de un único centro.
Ámbito
Hospital de tercer nivel en España.
Pacientes
Pacientes adultos con COVID-19 tratados con sistema ECMO por SDRA en nuestro centro entre Marzo 2020 y Marzo 2023.
Intervenciones
Recogida retrospectiva de variables durante el ingreso y el seguimiento.
Variables de interés principales
Se recogieron variables demográficas, antecedentes clínicos, variables relacionadas con la terapia ECMO, numero de ola de COVID-19, mortalidad hospitalaria, eventos adversos, duración de estancia en UCI y en hospital y estado funcional en el seguimiento.
Resultados
Se incluyeron 81 pacientes. De ellos 61 pacientes (75%) fallecieron durante la hospitalización. Los pacientes que fallecieron tenían más edad y más comorbilidad. Durante la segunda, tercera y sexta olas la mortalidad fue mayor. En el análisis multivariante, el único predictor independiente de mortalidad fue la edad (OR 1.24 IC 95% (1.027–1.5, P = 0.025). Después del alta, el 40% de los pacientes presentaban dificultades para retornar a una vida normal por insuficiencia respiratoria que precisaba de oxígeno y artropatías.
Conclusión
La mortalidad hospitalaria aumentó durante la pandemia. Tener mayor edad fue el único predictor independiente de mortalidad. Tras el alta, ningún paciente falleció durante los primeros 18 meses de seguimiento, aunque el 40% de los pacientes supervivientes presentan secuelas respiratorias y motoras que dificultan su regreso a una vida normal.}

In an age where technology is evolving at a sometimes incomprehensibly rapid pace, the liver community must adjust and learn to embrace breakthroughs with an open mind in order to benefit from potentially transformative influences on our science and practice. The Journal of Hepatology has responded to novel developments in artificial intelligence (AI) by recruiting experts in the field to serve on the Editorial Board. Publications introducing novel AI technology are no longer uncommon in our journal and are among the most highly debated and possibly practice-changing papers across a broad range of scientific disciplines, united by their focus on liver disease. As AI is rapidly evolving, this expert paper will focus on educating our readership on large language models and their possible impact on our research practice and clinical outlook, outlining both challenges and opportunities in the field. “To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” ― Winston S.

abstract = {Background
The importance of patient education has become increasingly apparent in recent years. A prominent patient education tool in neurosurgery is the Neurosurgical Conditions and Treatments page provided by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). This study aimed to investigate the readability of this resource page as many new articles have been incorporated in the past decade.
Methods
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease scores were calculated for each article. One-way analysis of variance and Scheffé, Tukey-Kramer, Bonferroni, Fisher least significant difference, and Dunnett test post hoc analyses were conducted to determine differences between each category with respect to their mean grade level and reading ease scores.
Results
Overall mean (SD) Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score was 40.2 (12.24), and overall mean (SD) Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score was 7.48 (1.26). Significant differences were found between mean reading ease scores between each categorization by the AANS (P = 0.014). No significant differences were found between mean grade level score for each categorization (analysis of variance, P = 0.154).
Conclusions
As compared to a single previous investigation conducted 10 years ago, the readability of articles has changed modestly, and the reading grade level remains well above the recommendations by the American Medical Association and National Institutes of Health. The 6 new articles introduced in the past decade have demonstrated similar readability, presenting a persistent challenge in the realm of patient education in neurosurgery.}
