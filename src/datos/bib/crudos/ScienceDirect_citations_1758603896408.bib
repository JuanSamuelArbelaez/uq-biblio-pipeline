Introducción y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial (IA) generativa permite preguntar, a través de los cuadros de diálogo, sobre patologías médicas. Nuestro objetivo fue analizar la calidad de la información acerca de las patologías urológicas más comunes en los chatbots ChatGPT de OpenIA, BARD de Google y Copilot de Microsoft.
Material y método
Se realizó un análisis de la información aportada por IA sobre las siguientes patologías y sus tratamientos: cáncer de próstata, cáncer renal, cáncer de vejiga, litiasis urinarias e hipertrofia benigna de próstata (HBP). A través de cuadros de diálogo se formularon preguntas estructuradas en inglés y en español, recopilando las respuestas para analizarlas posteriormente con cuestionarios DISCERN y sobre la idoneidad global de la respuesta. Los tratamientos quirúrgicos se realizaron con cuestionario de consentimiento informado.
Resultados
Las respuestas obtenidas a través de los tres chatbots explicaron la patología, detallaron los factores de riesgo y describieron los tratamientos. La diferencia radica en que BARD y Copilot aportan citas de información externa, algo que ChatGPT no realiza. Las puntuaciones DISCERN más altas, en números absolutos, se obtuvieron en Copilot; sin embargo, en la escala de idoneidad se objetivó que sus respuestas no fueron las más apropiadas. Las mejores puntuaciones de tratamientos quirúrgicos fueron obtenidas por BARD, seguido de ChatGPT y finalmente de Copilot.
Conclusiones
Las respuestas obtenidas de la IA generativa sobre enfermedades urológicas dependieron de la formulación de la pregunta. La información proporcionada presentó sesgos importantes, dependiendo de la patología, del idioma y, sobre todo, del cuadro de diálogo consultado.
Introduction and objective
Generative artificial intelligence makes it possible to ask about medical pathologies in dialog boxes. Our objective was to analyze the quality of information about the most common urological pathologies provided by ChatGPT (OpenIA), BARD (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft).
Methods
We analyzed information on the following pathologies and their treatments as provided by AI: prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, urinary lithiasis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Questions in English and Spanish were posed in dialog boxes; the answers were collected and analyzed with DISCERN questionnaires and the overall appropriateness of the response. Surgical procedures were performed with an informed consent questionnaire.
Results
The responses from the three chatbots explained the pathology, detailed risk factors, and described treatments. The difference is that BARD and Copilot provide external information citations, which ChatGPT does not. The highest DISCERN scores, in absolute numbers, were obtained in Copilot; however, on the appropriacy scale it was noted that their responses were not the most appropriate. The best surgical treatment scores were obtained by BARD, followed by ChatGPT, and finally Copilot.
Conclusions
The answers obtained from generative AI on urological diseases depended on the formulation of the question. The information provided had significant biases, depending on pathology, language, and above all, the dialog box consulted.}

abstract = {This case series explores the efficacy of freestyle perforator flaps, including the newly introduced suprascapular artery perforator flap (SSAP), in reconstructing trunk defects. Over a five-year period, 24 perforator flap procedures were performed on 19 patients, primarily for defect reconstruction after skin tumor and ulcer resections. Flap design was customized using preoperative doppler ultrasound and they were then transferred to defects in a V-Y or propeller fashion. The most frequently utilized flaps were the dorsal intercostal artery perforator (DICAP) flap and the lumbar artery perforator (LAP) flap. Notably, SSAP flaps were successfully employed for shoulder defects resulting from squamous cell carcinoma resections. Complications occurred in 29 % of cases, including seroma evacuation, hematoma, and wound dehiscence, with one patient experiencing severe liver failure post-surgery. The versatility of perforator-based reconstruction was demonstrated through the combination of DICAP and LAP flaps for large trunk defects. Additionally, internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) and lateral thoracic artery perforator (LTAP) flaps were utilized for parasternal and infraclavicular defects, respectively. The introduction of the SSAP flap expands the options for dorsal shoulder area reconstruction, offering faster healing and superior cosmetic results compared to traditional methods like secondary intention healing or skin grafting. Although this study showcases promising outcomes, further research is warranted to validate the effectiveness of SSAP flaps and to explore their applications in a broader patient population.}

abstract = {The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI)–based mental health chatbots, such as those on platforms like OpenAI’s GPT Store and Character. AI, raises issues of safety, effectiveness, and ethical use; they also raise an opportunity for patients and consumers to ensure AI tools clearly communicate how they meet their needs. While many of these tools claim to offer therapeutic advice, their unregulated status and lack of systematic evaluation create risks for users, particularly vulnerable individuals. This viewpoint article highlights the urgent need for a standardized framework to assess and demonstrate the safety, ethics, and evidence basis of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts. Drawing on clinical expertise, research, co-design experience, and the World Health Organization’s guidance, the authors propose key evaluation criteria: adherence to ethical principles, evidence-based responses, conversational skills, safety protocols, and accessibility. Implementation challenges, including setting output criteria without one “right answer,” evaluating multiturn conversations, and involving experts for oversight at scale, are explored. The authors advocate for greater consumer engagement in chatbot evaluation to ensure that these tools address users’ needs effectively and responsibly, emphasizing the ethical obligation of developers to prioritize safety and a strong base in empirical evidence.}

abstract = {Introduction
ASSORT (AI-based Symptom Stratification in Ophthalmology for Rapid Triage) is a GPT-4-based triage tool designed to assess ophthalmic emergencies using a three-tier color-coded system. This study compares ASSORT to the Rescue triage method, using the ophthalmologist’s final assessment as the reference standard.
Materials and methods
A prospective study was conducted at the Créteil University Hospital from April to June 2024. Each patient underwent triage using ASSORT, followed by the Rescue triage method. Both tools used the same color-coding system to stratify severity: yellow for emergency cases, green for urgent cases, and white for non-urgent cases. An examining ophthalmologist in their final year of residency performed the final assessment. Concordance between the ophthalmologist and each of the tools was analyzed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient, alongside precision and recall metrics.
Results
Fifty-one patients were included. Case severities were distributed as follows: 22/51 white, 27/51 green, and 2/51 yellow, with conjunctivitis (17.5 %) and corneal abrasions (12.5 %) being the two most common presentations. ASSORT demonstrated moderate agreement with the ophthalmologist (κ = 0.54), whereas Rescue showed stronger concordance (κ = 0.85). ASSORT tended to overestimate urgency, assigning more yellow codes than the ophthalmologist. McNemar’s test confirmed significant misclassification by ASSORT (p = 0.0156), while Rescue showed no significant deviation (p = 0.5).
Conclusion
While the small sample size limits generalizability, ASSORT shows potential for AI-driven ophthalmic triage but currently overestimates severity compared to the ophthalmologist. Further refinements such as reinforcement learning and multimodal input, as well as large-scale validation are needed to improve accuracy and reduce unnecessary emergency classifications before clinical implementation.}

abstract = {Generative AI with stronger responsiveness and emergent abilities has triggered a global boom and is facing challenges such as data compliance risks during the pretraining process and risks of generating fake information, which has raised concerns among global regulatory authorities. The European Union, United States, United Kingdom, and other countries and regions are gradually establishing risk-based, scenario-based, and outcome-based governance models for generative AI. China recently introduced new regulations for the management of generative AI, which adopt a governance model focusing on generative AI service providers. It suggests that China is continuing the principle of primary responsibility in Internet governance, which encompasses legal responsibility, contractual obligations, and ethical responsibility. However, the governance model based on primary responsibility emphasizes the accountability of generative AI model service providers, with relatively limited regulation on other important entities such as users and large-scale dissemination platforms, which may not be conducive to achieving China's regulatory goals for the AI industry. In comparison, the Meta-Regulation model could be an ideal alternative for China. As a classic theory explaining the public-private relationship, the ‘Meta-Regulation’ aligns with the generative AI governance requirements. Based on the Meta-Regulation theory, the governance of generative AI in China should move towards a direction of emphasizing safety, transparency, collaborative governance, and accountability. In line with this, it is necessary to include users and large-scale dissemination platforms within the regulatory scope and establish overarching governance objectives that ensure the responsible distribution of duties among stakeholders, with regulatory authorities assuming ultimate oversight responsibility and technical coordination. At the level of specific improvement measures, it is possible to integrate the three stages of model development, usage, and content dissemination of generative AI. During the model development stage, generative AI providers have specific transparency obligations. In the usage stage, a self-regulatory system centered around platform autonomy should be constructed. In the content dissemination stage, the proactive notification obligations of the dissemination platforms should be clearly defined. Additionally, the enforcement of technical interoperability requirements is necessary, thereby promoting the orderly development of generative AI applications.}

Furthermore, the paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the existing challenges in integrating AI with TCM, including the underdeveloped standardization system, insufficient foundational data, lack of model transparency and interpretability, and the urgent need for improved ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks. These limitations hinder the deep integration of AI into TCM. Only through a comprehensive understanding and effective resolution of these issues can AI be fully embedded into TCM practices, fostering innovation in the field and contributing Chinese wisdom and solutions to global health initiatives.}

abstract = {Background
The persistence of diagnostic errors, despite advances in medical knowledge and diagnostics, highlights the importance of understanding atypical disease presentations and their contribution to mortality and morbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative pre-trained transformers like GPT-4, holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, but requires further exploration in handling atypical presentations.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ChatGPT in generating differential diagnoses for atypical presentations of common diseases, with a focus on the model’s reliance on patient history during the diagnostic process.
Methods
We used 25 clinical vignettes from the Journal of Generalist Medicine characterizing atypical manifestations of common diseases. Two general medicine physicians categorized the cases based on atypicality. ChatGPT was then used to generate differential diagnoses based on the clinical information provided. The concordance between AI-generated and final diagnoses was measured, with a focus on the top-ranked disease (top 1) and the top 5 differential diagnoses (top 5).
Results
ChatGPT’s diagnostic accuracy decreased with an increase in atypical presentation. For category 1 (C1) cases, the concordance rates were 17% (n=1) for the top 1 and 67% (n=4) for the top 5. Categories 3 (C3) and 4 (C4) showed a 0% concordance for top 1 and markedly lower rates for the top 5, indicating difficulties in handling highly atypical cases. The χ2 test revealed no significant difference in the top 1 differential diagnosis accuracy between less atypical (C1+C2) and more atypical (C3+C4) groups (χ²1=2.07; n=25; P=.13). However, a significant difference was found in the top 5 analyses, with less atypical cases showing higher accuracy (χ²1=4.01; n=25; P=.048).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 demonstrates potential as an auxiliary tool for diagnosing typical and mildly atypical presentations of common diseases. However, its performance declines with greater atypicality. The study findings underscore the need for AI systems to encompass a broader range of linguistic capabilities, cultural understanding, and diverse clinical scenarios to improve diagnostic utility in real-world settings.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
Hepatorenal syndrome – Acute Kidney Injury (HRS-AKI) is a severe complication of decompensated cirrhosis that is challenging to predict. Large language models are robust for natural language processing. We aimed to determine if clinical sentiment in unstructured text can be derived by LLMs and used to improve prediction of Hepatorenal syndrome – Acute Kidney Injury (HRS-AKI) over traditional predictors alone.
Methods
Cohort study consisting of adult patients admitted to a single academic medical center with decompensated cirrhosis and AKI. We used Microsoft Azure OpenAI GPT-4o to derive a sentiment score ranging from 0 to 1 for HRS-AKI, and conduct natural language processing (NLP) extraction of clinical terms associated with HRS-AKI in admission notes. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) was compared in logistic regression models incorporating structured variables with versus without sentiment scores and NLP-extracted clinical terms.
Results
In our cohort of 314 participants, median age was 60, 48% were female, median MELD was 31. Higher sentiment score was associated with the diagnosis of HRS-AKI (OR 1.52 per 0.1, 95% CI 1.12-2.14) in multivariate models. AUROC using structured clinical covariates alone was 0.63. With the addition of GPT-4o derived sentiment score and clinical terms to structured covariates, the final model yielded an improved AUROC of 0.79 (p<0.01).
Conclusion
Clinical texts contain data that are difficult to extract using standard methodologies. Sentiment analysis and NLP-based variable derivation with GPT-4o in clinical application is feasible and can improve the prediction of HRS-AKI over structured data alone.}

Anaesthesia for cases involving quadruplets or higher order pregnancy is poorly described: literature review identified only nine cases detailing the conduct of anaesthesia. We present a case of spontaneous quad-chorionic quad-amniotic pregnancy in a 34-year-old patient with two prior CDs, who underwent elective CD at 30 + 5 weeks’ gestation under combined spinal epidural (CSE) anaesthesia with a reduced-dose intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 2.0 mL and diamorphine 300 μg. Key clinical considerations include aortocaval compression and spinal hypotension, heightened risks of haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, eclampsia, preterm delivery and perinatal morbidity. Despite pregnancy induced hypertension, surgery proceeded uneventfully, with an operating time of 46 minutes and 350 mL blood loss. Four live neonates (weighing 1300–1345 g) were delivered and admitted to the neonatal unit without major morbidity. No additional intraoperative analgesia or epidural anaesthesia top-up was required, and the patient reported high satisfaction with anaesthetic management. Postoperative recovery was complicated by maternal hypertension, managed with oral therapy, with hospital discharge on the 4th postoperative day. At 10 months post-delivery, the quadruplets continue to meet age-adjusted developmental milestones. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which low dose CSE anaesthesia was provided for a quadruplet or higher-order CD. The case description highlights the challenges associated with high-order multiple gestation pregnancy, and considerations for the anaesthetist in such cases.}

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate genetic parameters and perform a haplotype-based genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions associated with indicator traits for endoparasite resistance in Santa Ines sheep. Haplotype GWAS was performed using linkage disequilibrium blocks (haploblocks) defined by the Haploview software. Records from 1725 animals for Famacha© (FAM, N = 5560), packed cell volume (PCV, N = 5135), total plasma protein (TPP, N = 4356), and fecal egg count (FEC, N = 4248) were used for analysis. The pedigree file contained information from 4821 animals; of these, 638 animals were genotyped using the Ovine SNP50 Genotyping BeadChip. Heritability estimates were moderate for FAM (0.26), PCV (0.26), TPP (0.16), and log-transformed FEC (0.19). Genomic regions that explained more than 0.3 % of the total additive genetic variance of the traits were defined as significant. These regions overlapped with quantitative traits loci associated with eosinophil number, fecal egg count, hematocrit, and immunoglobulin levels. In the top regions for the traits evaluated we found genes individually involved in inflammatory response, immunity, macrophage function in host-pathogen interactions, and other biological functions. All indicator traits for resistance to gastrointestinal parasites evaluated in this study exhibited sufficient genetic variability to respond to selection and can be used to improve the health and consequently the production of Santa Ines sheep.}

As ChatGPT is trained on published material, allowing it to find and parse relevant literature about prompted targets, it in theory is an ideal way to make literature reviews more efficient. As more academics use the tool, gauging the accuracy of the information gathered by this automation becomes important. Our research aims to assess the accuracy of literature found by ChatGPT when performing a systematic review. We searched PubMed for recent systematic reviews on chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and hypertension) published before November 2022. Two researchers extracted aims and inclusion/exclusion criteria from each review. Using these criteria, we prompted ChatGPT to find 10 relevant articles. Researchers then cross-referenced ChatGPT’s results with Google Scholar, PubMed, and Tulane Library’s database. We categorized ChatGPT’s results as fake, real but not in the review, or matched with the review. If ChatGPT provided 10 real articles, we prompted it for another set. We calculated the rates of each outcome. Nine systematic reviews were selected to assess ChatGPT’s ability to conduct literature reviews. In total, ChatGPT found 90 articles after 9 sets of 10 articles each of 90 articles, 58% of articles were real but 38 (42%) of citations were for articles that did not exist. Additionally, of the 90 articles, only 16 (18%) matched articles in the systematic reviews. 38 (42%) were fake, 16 (18%) were real articles that matched the target review, and 36 (40%) were real articles but did not match the reviews. Furthermore, we never achieved 10/10 real articles in a single query. ChatGPT is a tool that can demonstrably make healthcare research tasks more efficient. However, healthcare decision and policy makers cannot yet rely on pure generative AI output without knowing whether humans were involved in the entire research process. And so, there appears to exist an ability ceiling above which the current ChatGPT algorithms cannot reach.}

abstract = {Purpose
Through a systematic content analysis, this paper aims to examine the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the services of the top 100 US university libraries and explores the key factors that influence the adoption of this technology. It seeks to provide actionable strategic recommendations for library administrators. These recommendations aim to help libraries accelerate their intelligent service transformation while maintaining their academic resource advantages and humanistic traditions, and to establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors analyse the current status of libraries adopting AI technologies and applying them to patron services, which include intelligent retrieval services, intelligent reference services, intelligent guided tour services and intelligent ID recognition services, among others. Firstly, the authors visit the official websites of the top 100 US university libraries to collect information. Subsequently, the prevalence of AI technologies is statistically analysed, and several excellent practice cases are selected. Finally, based on the data obtained from the content analysis, the impact of university rankings on the adoption of AI technologies in US university libraries is analysed.
Findings
The study finds that AI technologies are widely applied in the services of US university libraries, but there are differences in the adoption rates across different services. Almost all libraries have adopted intelligent retrieval and recommendation technology (99%). In terms of intelligent reference services, more than half of the libraries have used AI technologies (53%). Intelligent guided tour technology is also widely adopted (95%). The application of intelligent ID recognition technology in libraries is equally common (98%). Furthermore, more than half of the libraries have begun to explore generative AI technologies (61%). Additionally, the study further discovers that there is a significant negative correlation between university rankings and the number of AI technologies adopted by libraries. This indicates that top-ranked universities are more likely to introduce a variety of AI technologies in their library services.
Research limitations/implications
The study’s implications include constructing an analytical framework to assess AI in library services and identifying key adoption factors. It explores AI’s impact on service diversity and the popularity of different services. Notably, it finds a link between university rankings and AI adoption, offering insights into the relationship between tech adoption and institutional reputation.
Originality/value
This paper provides the latest statistical data on the use of AI technologies in US university libraries. It aims to help librarians understand the overall application situation and best practices. With these insights, librarians can develop corresponding plans to better use AI to serve patrons.}

Workflows, advantages and limitations are identified through a comprehensive practical comparison example. The results show many similarities regarding generative capabilities and highlight several advantages of Text-to-Image AI models, including an easier way of capturing product grammars and a wider and more immediate range of further applications. In contrast, Shape Grammars approach proved more solid in aspects related to exploration workflows and cognitive stimulation.

The proposed workflow was implemented using GD-embedded software, Fusion (Autodesk Inc.), and tested by designing PSIs for one Le Fort I osteotomy case and one genioplasty case. The performance of the GD workflow was assessed through the time required for design and the basic properties of the GD PSIs. The hands-on time for the design was 94 min for the Le Fort I fixation plate and 45 min for the genioplasty plate. The maximum von Mises stress was 227.63 MPa for the Le Fort I fixation plate and 237.31 MPa for the genioplasty fixation plate. The GD-based workflow simplified and accelerated the design of PSIs for orthognathic surgery. Biomechanical analysis indicated the feasibility of generative designed patient-specific implants for clinical practice.}

abstract = {For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the planning of manual assembly activities represents a significant cost and resource factor, requiring precision and meticulous organization. To ensure a stable competitive and economical production, the steps involved in manual assembly must be optimized. In today’s digital era, Artificial Intelligences (AI) offer innovative approaches and opportunities to streamline processes. In addition to LLM AIs, AI image generators are currently attracting a lot of attention as they generate very realistic and detailed images based on a given description. Images or visualisations of the situation are often used to make work instructions in manual assembly easier to understand. AI image generators can be used to visualise assembly process steps for automatically generated work instructions. In this research, a quantitative measure is proposed that can be used to rate how correctly the actual situation is depicted by highlighting incorrect or false objects and operations and assessing the accuracy of the context. The measure is validated by qualitatively evaluating images created with DALL-E 3 in an user study by both workers and planning experts from industry and comparing them with the quantitative measure. This will enable further research in the field of automated work planning and the comparison of different AI image generation tools for use in assembly planning.}

This study examines the impact of global supply chain pressure on Chinese business and consumer confidence from February 2000 to September 2024. It employs Quantile-on-quantile (QQ) regression, which helps to understand how varying levels of global supply chain pressure influence different levels of Chinese business and consumer confidence, providing insights beyond what can be gauged via a mean-based regression. The main results show the following: Firstly, Chinese business confidence is negatively associated with supply chain pressure across all upper, middle, and lower quantiles, reflecting a homogenous adverse impact irrespective of the levels of both variables. Secondly, Chinese consumer confidence is impacted heterogeneously by the magnitude of supply chain pressure, indicating the relevance of the quantile distribution of both variables to their association. The results remain valid after applying a Wavelet Quantile Correlation approach, indicating their robustness. Our findings offer crucial insights to Chinese policymakers and other stakeholders, suggesting that Chinese businesses do not tolerate pressure in the global supply chain, whereas Chinese consumers tend to switch to local products and services during lapses in the global supply chain.}

abstract = {Background
Symptom checker apps (SCAs) are layperson-facing tools that advise on whether and where to seek care, or possible diagnoses. Previous research has primarily focused on evaluating the accuracy, safety, and usability of their recommendations. However, studies examining SCAs’ impact on clinical care, including the patient-physician interaction and satisfaction with care, remain scarce.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the effects of an SCA on satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction in acute care settings. Additionally, we examined its influence on patients’ anxiety and trust in the treating physician.
Methods
This parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted at 2 emergency departments of an academic medical center and an emergency practice in Berlin, Germany. Low-acuity patients seeking care at these sites were randomly assigned to either self-assess their health complaints using a widely available commercial SCA (Ada Health) before their first encounter with the treating physician or receive usual care. The primary endpoint was patients’ satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction, measured by the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ). The secondary outcomes were patients’ satisfaction with care, their anxiety levels, and physicians’ satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction. We used linear mixed models to assess the statistical significance of primary and secondary outcomes. Exploratory descriptive analyses examined patients’ and physicians’ perceptions of the SCA’s utility and the frequency of patients questioning their physician’s authority.
Results
Between April 11, 2022, and January 25, 2023, we approached 665 patients. A total of 363 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome (intervention: n=173, control: n=190). PSQ scores in the intervention group were similar to those in the control group (mean 78.5, SD 20.0 vs mean 80.8, SD 19.6; estimated difference –2.4, 95% CI –6.3 to 1.1, P=.24). Secondary outcomes, including patients’ and physicians’ satisfaction with care and patient anxiety, showed no significant group differences (all P>.05). Patients in the intervention group were more likely to report that the SCA had a beneficial (66/164, 40.2%) rather than a detrimental (3/164, 1.8%) impact on the patient-physician interaction, with most reporting no effect (95/164, 57.9%). Similar patterns were observed regarding the SCA’s perceived effect on care. In both groups, physicians rarely reported that their authority had been questioned by a patient (intervention: 2/188, 1.1%; control: 4/184, 2.2%). While physicians more often found the SCA helpful rather than unhelpful, the majority indicated it was neither helpful nor unhelpful for the encounter.
Conclusions
We found no evidence that the SCA improved satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction or care in an acute care setting. By contrast, both patients and their treating physicians predominantly described the SCA’s impact as beneficial. Our study did not identify negative effects of SCA use commonly reported in the literature, such as increased anxiety or diminished trust in health care professionals.

The second experiment required the AI tools to design a headphone holder stand from scratch, further assessing their capabilities in CAD, but also their abilities in product design. The experiments found that these technologies show great potential in the area of engineering design.

However, within its dedicated communities, there is recognition of a persistent gap in transitioning these innovations from laboratory-scale success to widespread industrial adoption. Scaling up PI technologies is far more complex than simply replicating laboratory conditions on a larger scale. Challenges such as the integration with existing units and processes, proving economic viability, and navigating regulatory requirements often impede the practical implementation of PI innovations. This paper aims to identify the key enablers for scaling up PI technologies by presenting a roadmap to bridge the gap between concept and commercialization. While robust engineering design frameworks and advanced modeling tools are crucial, interdisciplinary collaborations and lab-to-market partnerships (or integrated scaling collaborations) are equally critical to drive the successful adoption of PI at the industrial scale.}

According to this theory, a human can claim authorship when they are guided by artistic imagery thinking and manifest individual creativity throughout the entire creation process from conception to execution. In the HAIC model, the unpredictable nature of the AI black box does not impede the recognition of users’ control, as users possess the capability for artistic imagery thinking to direct the entire creation process. If their contribution meets the originality standard, they qualify as the author of the AIGC. Current prevailing views that evaluate AIGC’s originality on the basis of either the final form of expression or the users’ prompts in the initial stage overlook the dynamic nature of the creative process.}

abstract = {Introduction
The effect of gender on teaching satisfaction in clinical medicine has been mixed. While earlier studies often reported that female physician educators receive lower evaluation scores than their male counterparts, particularly in traditionally male-dominated fields such as surgery, more recent evidence suggests a shift, with female faculty receiving comparable or even higher ratings. We hypothesised that female faculty in Orthopaedic surgery, a predominantly male specialty, would receive lower teaching satisfaction scores due to potential biases arising from the male-dominated nature of the field and societal norms.
Methods
A retrospective review of an electronically administered post-lesson teaching evaluation from students from two undergraduate and one postgraduate medical school in the field of Orthopaedic surgery. Evaluations were based on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 on “overall satisfaction” and “educational relevance”. Free text feedback for the educators were also obtained. The data was collected over a three-year period (Academic Years 2021–2024).
Results
A total of 3358 student evaluations from 653 teaching sessions were identified. Male faculty delivered 602 teaching sessions with 3110 evaluations. Female faculty delivered 51 teaching sessions with 248 evaluations. A total of 44 male surgeons and 4 female surgeons were involved in education. Female faculty received higher mean satisfaction scores (4.87 ± 0.24) compared to males (4.73 ± 0.47) (p = 0.035). Relevance scores were not significantly different (female 4.87 ± 0.27, male 4.79 ± 0.38, p = 0.16). “Clear” and “engaging” were the top two most frequently used adjectives to describe the teaching characteristics for both genders. The third-ranked adjective was “interactive” for males and “helpful”, “encouraging”, and “interactive” for females in a three-way tie.
Conclusions
Female Orthopaedic faculty achieved higher teaching satisfaction scores compared to male counterparts, dispelling possible negative gender stereotypes in both the male-dominated field and within the broader Southeast Asian social context.}

abstract = {Generative AI (genAI) tools have involved rapid and broad uptake since their wide release in late 2022, including among teachers. We investigated several factors that play a role in teachers’ motivation and engagement to harness genAI in teaching and learning. We examined contextual factors (in-school support to apply genAI, time pressure, disruptive student behavior) as predictors of motivation (genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e., genAI integration in teaching-related work and student learning activities) over the course of one school term. Among 368 Australian primary and secondary school teachers, our findings revealed that genAI support was associated with greater genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing. Time pressure was also linked with greater genAI valuing, whereas disruptive student behavior was not linked with the genAI motivation or engagement variables. In turn, genAI self-efficacy was linked with greater levels of both types of genAI integration. GenAI valuing was associated with greater genAI integration in teaching-related work only. Our results provide knowledge about factors relevant for supporting genAI and its application among teachers in Australia—and also hold relevance to teachers in other countries.}

In this study, to explore the structural mechanics mechanism, virtual models are performed based on the physical data of the soil and structure, and are compared to the on-site photos of the same scenarios. The basic mechanics is inspected by three Generative AI models in 73 tests to explore the mechanisms by text outputs. The physical-based simplified mechanics models are calculated on the first two supports scenarios to offer some guides and knowledge to the following data mining work. The structural physical mechanics is also numerical simulated to offer some further physical guides. The structure monitoring data of the support axial force and the diaphragm wall deformation in the deep excavation is explored with the time and excavating depths varying, and the relationship of the dual heterogeneous mechanics performance are qualitative discussed by a three-dimension demonstration method. Furthermore, a novel index, the ratio of the force to the deformation, is proposed on the data-driven sight. The relationship is calculated quantitatively on the proposed index in different construction stages, and the probability distribution is inspected. In summary, three physical-based models are performed and investigated to offer physical guides for data-driven dual heterogeneous mechanics mechanism on an underground excavation case in Metro construction, and the qualitative and quantitative exploring are performed based on the three-dimension data demonstrations and on a proposed index. The mechanism exploring methods can be synthetical integrated for the future engineering expert systems in engineering, and for the coming intelligence construction.}

As novel technologies arise or existing ones further develop, it becomes increasingly challenging to balance leveraging these advancements and safeguarding personal data. By relying on firsthand accounts of professionals in the field, the paper identifies how these challenges, which appear to be applicable to data controllers and Data Protection Authorities, are substantially connected with ensuring a sound interpretation of the law through time. The paper examines the leading foresight and anticipation techniques and explores their possible data protection applications by reviewing existing initiatives that attempt to implement foresight in the context of data protection. Section 2 delves into the evolving regulatory landscape, emphasising the need for a foresight-based approach to tackle the complexities arising from data-intensive technologies and the changing European regulatory framework. Section 3 introduces foresight as a discipline, its history and evolution, and leading techniques. Section 4 presents practical examples of foresight in data protection, detailing initiatives by the authors and other actors in the data protection space. In conclusion, the paper underscores the initial consensus on the benefits of anticipatory approaches in addressing current data protection challenges. Anticipation techniques, as a flexible concept, can be tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders, fostering a collaborative and practical approach to data protection. However, a gap in consolidated methodologies persists, necessitating further research to design and implement practical foresight approaches.}

abstract = {Background
Over 70% of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) present with a non-shockable initial rhythm, asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), which is associated with lower survival than a shockable initial rhythm. Advanced airway management and oxygen delivery are important OHCA interventions, but their impact based on different presenting rhythm groups are incompletely defined. Our objective was to determine if advanced airway strategy is associated with outcomes in shockable, PEA and asystolic OHCA.
Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of data collected from the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART), which assigned adults with OHCA to a strategy of either endotracheal intubation (ETI) or laryngeal tube (LT) for initial advanced airway management. We stratified patients by initial cardiac rhythm: shockable (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT), AED shock), PEA or asystole. We excluded AED non-shockable and unknown rhythms. The primary outcome was 72-h survival. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at emergency department arrival, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with good neurological function (modified Rankin score ≤3). We used general estimating equations to determine the associations between airway strategy initial arrest rhythm and outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, witnessed status, and bystander CPR.
Results
There were 3004 patients in the parent trial of which 2847 were included in this analysis. Of these 575 (20.2 %) were shockable, 671 (23.6 %) were PEA, and 1601 (56.2 %) were asystole. Compared with ETI, LT airway use was not associated with improved 72-h survival in shockable rhythms (adjusted [AOR] 1.30 (0.91, 1.67)), PEA (AOR 0.97 (0.65, 1.45)), or asystole (AOR 1.13 (0.79, 1.64)). Similarly, we noted no significant interaction between airway strategy and initial rhythm for the secondary outcomes of ROSC, survival to discharge, and survival to discharge with good neurological function.
Conclusion
Prehospital advanced airway management strategy (ETI vs. LT) was not significantly associated with outcomes regardless of initial cardiac rhythm.}

To address this, a method is proposed that automates the generation of these relationships from the debate comments, classifying them into positive and negative using sentiment analysis, namely with the Large Language Model. A new operator is introduced that weights these comments to calculate preference relations. Furthermore, modification of the relationships is allowed if the experts so wish. Moreover, another operator is incorporated that adjusts the weight of each expert according to his or her active participation in the discussion, assigning more weight to those who contribute more comments. Finally, this innovative method promotes coherence and equal participation in group decision-making by employing an innovative sentiment analysis detection system.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is used increasingly in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). However, the true role, utility, advantages, and limitations of AI tools in POCUS have been poorly understood.
Aim
to conduct a scoping review on the current literature of AI in POCUS to identify (1) how AI is being applied in POCUS, and (2) how AI in POCUS could be utilized in clinical settings.
Methods
The review followed the JBI scoping review methodology. A search strategy was conducted in Medline, Embase, Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and AI POCUS manufacturer websites. Selection criteria, evidence screening, and selection were performed in Covidence. Data extraction and analysis were performed on Microsoft Excel by the primary investigator and confirmed by the secondary investigators.
Results
Thirty-three papers were included. AI POCUS on the cardiopulmonary region was the most prominent in the literature. AI was most frequently used to automatically measure biometry using POCUS images. AI POCUS was most used in acute settings. However, novel applications in non-acute and low-resource settings were also explored. AI had the potential to increase POCUS accessibility and usability, expedited care and management, and had a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy in limited applications such as measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, Left-Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral and identifying B-lines of the lung. However, AI could not interpret poor images, underperformed compared to standard-of-care diagnostic methods, and was less effective in patients with specific disease states, such as severe illnesses that limit POCUS image acquisition.
Conclusion
This review uncovered the applications of AI in POCUS and the advantages and limitations of AI POCUS in different clinical settings. Future research in the field must first establish the diagnostic accuracy of AI POCUS tools and explore their clinical utility through clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background
Patients find technology tools to be more approachable for seeking sensitive health-related information, such as reproductive health information. The inventive conversational ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI Inc), offers a potential means for patients to effectively locate answers to their health-related questions digitally.
Objective
A pilot study was conducted to compare the novel ChatGPT with the existing Google Search technology for their ability to offer accurate, effective, and current information regarding proceeding action after missing a dose of oral contraceptive pill.
Methods
A sequence of 11 questions, mimicking a patient inquiring about the action to take after missing a dose of an oral contraceptive pill, were input into ChatGPT as a cascade, given the conversational ability of ChatGPT. The questions were input into 4 different ChatGPT accounts, with the account holders being of various demographics, to evaluate potential differences and biases in the responses given to different account holders. The leading question, “what should I do if I missed a day of my oral contraception birth control?” alone was then input into Google Search, given its nonconversational nature. The results from the ChatGPT questions and the Google Search results for the leading question were evaluated on their readability, accuracy, and effective delivery of information.
Results
The ChatGPT results were determined to be at an overall higher-grade reading level, with a longer reading duration, less accurate, less current, and with a less effective delivery of information. In contrast, the Google Search resulting answer box and snippets were at a lower-grade reading level, shorter reading duration, more current, able to reference the origin of the information (transparent), and provided the information in various formats in addition to text.
Conclusions
ChatGPT has room for improvement in accuracy, transparency, recency, and reliability before it can equitably be implemented into health care information delivery and provide the potential benefits it poses. However, AI may be used as a tool for providers to educate their patients in preferred, creative, and efficient ways, such as using AI to generate accessible short educational videos from health care provider-vetted information. Larger studies representing a diverse group of users are needed.}

abstract = {Background
Substance use trends are complex; they often rapidly evolve and necessitate an intersectional approach in research, service, and policy making. Current and emerging digital tools related to substance use are promising but also create a range of challenges and opportunities.
Objective
This paper reports on a backcasting exercise aimed at the development of a roadmap that identifies values, challenges, facilitators, and milestones to achieve optimal use of digital tools in the substance use field by 2030.
Methods
A backcasting exercise method was adopted, wherein the core elements are identifying key values, challenges, facilitators, milestones, cornerstones and a current, desired, and future scenario. A structured approach was used by means of (1) an Open Science Framework page as a web-based collaborative working space and (2) key stakeholders’ collaborative engagement during the 2022 Lisbon Addiction Conference.
Results
The identified key values were digital rights, evidence-based tools, user-friendliness, accessibility and availability, and person-centeredness. The key challenges identified were ethical funding, regulations, commercialization, best practice models, digital literacy, and access or reach. The key facilitators identified were scientific research, interoperable infrastructure and a culture of innovation, expertise, ethical funding, user-friendly designs, and digital rights and regulations. A range of milestones were identified. The overarching identified cornerstones consisted of creating ethical frameworks, increasing access to digital tools, and continuous trend analysis.
Conclusions
The use of digital tools in the field of substance use is linked to a range of risks and opportunities that need to be managed. The current trajectories of the use of such tools are heavily influenced by large multinational for-profit companies with relatively little involvement of key stakeholders such as people who use drugs, service providers, and researchers. The current funding models are problematic and lack the necessary flexibility associated with best practice business approaches such as lean and agile principles to design and execute customer discovery methods. Accessibility and availability, digital rights, user-friendly design, and person-focused approaches should be at the forefront in the further development of digital tools. Global legislative and technical infrastructures by means of a global action plan and strategy are necessary and should include ethical frameworks, accessibility of digital tools for substance use, and continuous trend analysis as cornerstones.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) personas for training library staff in an online chat reference environment, enhancing trainees’ abilities to respond effectively to real-life patron requests.
Design/methodology/approach
The project used ChatGPT-4 to construct custom generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) that acted as library patrons and presented the types of questions and reference requests that library staff would likely receive. These AI personas were improved iteratively and collaboratively. Novice chat reference users were surveyed on their experiences with the final AI personas.
Findings
The use of AI personas for training library staff showed promising results. AI personas could simulate interactions with actual patrons, and trainees’ confidence levels increased due to their use. However, limitations still exist, as AI personas were prone to providing overly detailed answers or required prompting to stay on task.
Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to apply AI personas in the context of improving training for online chat reference. The experience contrasts with other efforts to use generative AI to provide answers directly to patrons without human intervention or involvement.}

abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis, characterized by non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, is a multisystem disease with an unpredictable disease spectrum. An estimated 5% of sarcoidosis patients have clinically evident cardiac involvement while 25% may have asymptomatic silent disease leading to challenging diagnosis.
Objectives:
We aim to study the clinical characteristics in a cohort of cardiac sarcoidosis patients to identify patterns of cardiac involvement and clinical correlations.
Methods:
We conducted a single center retrospective study of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis at Mayo Clinic Florida. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB). Inclusion criteria was patients older than 18 years of age, with diagnosis of sarcoid myocarditis/cardiac sarcoidosis/sarcoid heart muscle disease specified ICD-10 code D86.85 with established visits using specified CPT codes between 02/25/2018 till 08/24/2023. A list of 99 patients was generated and 76 patients met above criteria. Subsequently data from each patient was collected that included baseline demographics and disease characteristics.
Results:
Table 1 provides patient demographics. 44 (57.9%) patients were male and 32 (42.1 %) were female with 59 (77.6%) Caucasian and 14 (18.4%) African American. There were 7 deaths (9.2% mortality) with 1 from cardiogenic shock, 1 cardiopulmonary arrest and 1 attributed to side effects of immunosuppressive therapy. 13 (17.1%) patients had a positive exposure history to chemicals and toxins. Only 6 (17.6%) patients had an abnormal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level. Non-necrotizing granulomas noted on pathology in 19 (25.0%) patients and 54 (71.1%) had negative biopsy. Tissue sampled included lung 15 (19.7%), lymph node 19 (25.0%) and cardiac 10 (13.2%). 49 (64.5%) patients had cardiomyopathy with dilated being the most common and heart failure reduced ejection fraction (EF) the predominant type (N=28[41.8%]). 27 (35.5%) patients had abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular (AV) blocks the most frequent rhythm abnormalities. Cardiac MRI was performed in 60 cases and 55 (91.7%) had late gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (PET) was performed in 47 cases and was positive in 42 (89.4%) cases. 69 (90.8%) patients achieved remission while relapsing disease was an unfortunate occurrence in 36 (47.4%) cases [Figure 1].
Conclusion:
Development of a standardized diagnostic algorithm and classification criteria for cardiac sarcoidosis is imperative. Our cohort recorded a high mortality and relapse rate and surveillance for cardiac involvement must be undertaken in all patients with sarcoidosis. Certain occupational exposures were identified and prompts raising awareness for environmental safety. Figure 1Relapse probability over time (months)

abstract = {Generative AI technologies are rapidly advancing and are increasingly deployed by firms for marketing purposes. However, research on generative AI in the marketing domain remains limited, particularly regarding the balance of human-AI collaboration in generative AI video advertisements. This study explores and distinguishes between two types of generative AI video ads based on the balance of human-AI collaboration: (1) those featuring human-AI collaborative characters and (2) those comprising solely AI-generated characters. Using the elaboration likelihood model as a lens, this study proposes a conceptual framework with two parallel mediators: one at the cognitive level (perceived creativity) and the other at the emotional level (AI anxiety). A multi-method study was conducted, employing diverse data sources and analytical techniques. In Study 1, we analyze a real-world dataset of generative AI video advertisements on YouTube to identify the distinct types and examine audience reactions. In Study 2, an experimental design is used to causally evaluate the effects of these advertisements on the audience. The results indicate that generative AI advertisements featuring real human-AI character collaborations generate more favorable audience attitudes, as they are perceived to be more creative and evoke lower levels of AI-induced anxiety compared to advertisements composed entirely of AI-generated characters. The study underscores the critical role of humans as gatekeepers of humanity.}
