abstract = {Background
Sepsis is a severe syndrome of organ dysfunction caused by infection; it has high heterogeneity and high in-hospital mortality, representing a grim clinical challenge for precision medicine in critical care.
Objective
We aimed to extract reported sepsis biomarkers to provide users with comprehensive biomedical information and integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineering to enhance the accuracy, stability, and interpretability of clinical decisions recommended by large language models (LLMs).
Methods
To address the challenge, we established and updated the first knowledge-enhanced platform, MetaSepsisKnowHub, comprising 427 sepsis biomarkers and 423 studies, aiming to systematically collect and annotate sepsis biomarkers to guide personalized clinical decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment of human sepsis. We curated a tailored LLM framework incorporating RAG and prompt engineering and incorporated 2 performance evaluation scales: the System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score.
Results
The overall quantitative ratings of expert-reviewed clinical recommendations based on RAG surpassed baseline responses generated by 4 LLMs and showed a statistically significant improvement in textual questions (GPT-4: mean 75.79, SD 7.11 vs mean 81.59, SD 9.87; P=.02; GPT-4o: mean 70.36, SD 7.63 vs mean 77.98, SD 13.26; P=.02; Qwen2.5-instruct: mean 77.08 SD 3.75 vs mean 85.46, SD 7.27; P<.001; and DeepSeek-R1: mean 77.67, SD 3.66 vs mean 86.42, SD 8.56; P<.001), but no significant statistical differences could be measured in clinical scenarios. The RAG assessment score comparing RAG-based responses and expert-provided benchmark answers illustrated prominent factual correctness, accuracy, and knowledge recall compared to the baseline responses. After use, the average the System Usability Scale score was 82.20 (SD 14.17) and the Net Promoter Score was 72, demonstrating high user satisfaction and loyalty.
Conclusions
We highlight the pioneering MetaSepsisKnowHub platform, and we show that combining MetaSepsisKnowHub with RAG can minimize limitations on precision and maximize the breadth of LLMs to shorten the bench-to-bedside distance, serving as a knowledge-enhanced paradigm for future application of artificial intelligence in critical care medicine.}

Resecting liver surgery has been dominated by open surgical approaches (OLR). Minimal invasive procedures such as robotic liver surgery (RLR) are technically challenging but may reduce the surgical trauma and complication rates.
Objectives & methods
This study aims to compare the outcomes of RLR and OLR. A retrospective, single-centre analysis was conducted on 185 patients who underwent liver resection for benign or malign diseases (OLR: 86, RLR: 99). The primary objective was complication rates based on Clavien-Dindo classification, Secondary objectives included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and resection outcomes.
Results
RLR was associated with significantly less major complications (23.1 % vs. 41.9 %, p = 0.011), lower blood loss (200 ml vs. 400 ml, p = 0.013) and shorter hospital stays (9.0 vs. 13.0 days, p < 0.001). Primary oncological results were similar.
Conclusion
RLR provides equivalent resection quality to OLR, with fewer complications, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays.}

abstract = {Background
Empathy is a cornerstone of interpersonal and emotional health, yet its measurement often conflates self-oriented sympathetic responses with other-oriented empathy. To measure other-oriented empathy in its interpersonal manifestation, the Self-Effacing Empathy Scale (SEES) was examined for its validity and reliability among adolescents and their parents.
Method
Adolescents and their parents, resident in South Africa were recruited through social media. Hundred and twelve participants completed a composite questionnaire that comprised the SEES, Basic Empathy Scale (BES), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Vigour Assessment Scale (VAS). A replicative data set comprising the same measures was collected eight weeks later from the same participants.
Results
Convergent validity of the SEES was found in it correlating strongly in the initial data set with the BES (r = 0.639) and moderately with the other-oriented items of the IRI (r = 0.528), and strongly in the replicative data set (r = 0.884; r = 0.771). Discriminant validity was found in its weak correlation with the VAS (r = 0.326) in the initial data set. Cronbach's alpha coefficients indicated good (0.697) and excellent (0.940) internal consistency. The SEES incurred a small standard error of measurement, whereby the total scores were differing at most between 2.34 and 2.49 from the true values over 72 theoretically possible scores. A three-factor model indicated structural reliability, accounting for 46.3 % and 64.8 % of the cumulative variance in the respective data sets.
Conclusions
The SEES provides a valid and reliable measure for investigating associations between health and self-effacing empathy, and effects of interventions on it.}

abstract = {Background
Discussing weight remains a sensitive and often avoided topic in health care, despite rising prevalence of obesity and calls for earlier, more compassionate interventions. Many health care professionals report inadequate training and low confidence to discuss weight, while patients often describe feeling stigmatized or dismissed. Digital simulation offers a promising route to build communication skills through supporting repeatable and reflective practice in a safe space. VITAL-COMS (Virtual Training and Assessment for Communication Skills) is a novel simulation tool designed to support health care professionals in navigating weight-related conversations with greater understanding and skill.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the potential of VITAL-COMS as a digital simulation training tool to improve weight-related communication skills among health care professionals.
Methods
A mixed-method feasibility study was conducted online via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) between January to July 2021, with UK-based nurses, doctors, and dietitians. The intervention comprised educational videos and 2 simulated patient scenarios with real-time verbal interaction. Pre- and posttraining self-assessments of communication skills and conversation length were collected. Participants also completed a feasibility questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the feasibility questionnaire, and open-ended feedback was analyzed using content analysis. Paired-samples t tests were used to assess changes in communication skills and conversation length before and post training.
Results
In total, 31 participants completed the study. There was a statistically significant improvement in self-assessed communication skills following training (mean difference=3.9; 95% CI, 2.54‐5.26; t30=−5.76, P=.001, Cohen d=1.03). Mean conversation length increased significantly in both scenarios: in the female patient scenario, from 3.73 (SD 1.36) to 6.08 (SD 2.26) minutes, with a mean difference of 2.35 minutes (95% CI, 1.71‐2.99; t30=7.49, P=.001, Cohen d=1.34); and in the male scenario, from 3.61 (SD 1.12) to 5.65 (SD 1.76) minutes, a mean difference of 2.03 minutes (95% CI, 1.51‐2.55; t30=8.03, P=.001, Cohen d=1.44). Participants rated the simulation positively, with 97% (95% CI 90%‐100%) supporting wider use in health care and 84% (95% CI 71%‐97%) reporting emotional engagement. Content analysis of feedback generated two themes: (1) adapting to this form of learning and (2) recognizing the potential of simulation to support reflective, skills-based training. A minority, 13% (95% CI 1%‐25%) expressed a preference for alternative learning methods.
Conclusions
VITAL-COMS was feasible to implement and acceptable to a diverse group of health care professionals. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in self-assessed communication skills and patient-scenario engagement. The simulation was perceived as realistic, emotionally engaging, and well-suited for training in sensitive conversations. These findings support further development and integration of VITAL-COMS into health education programs. Next steps include the translation of the insights identified in this study to inform a tool supported by generative artificial intelligence.}

abstract = {Background
Digestive system perforations after anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS), if left untreated, are life-threatening. These injuries are often categorized as pharyngoesophageal. Although the pharynx and esophagus are continuations of each other, they are two distinct anatomical structures. There is limited experience in managing patients with pharyngeal injuries after ACSS.
Methods
Using PRISMA guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted on the iatrogenic pharyngeal perforations after ACSS for the treatment of disc herniation and degenerative cervical myeloradiculopathy.
Results
A total of 12 patients met our inclusion criteria. Eleven were from published studies, and one was our patient (2 female and 10 male, mean age = 56.25 years, range: 31–82 years). Clinical symptoms of patients with iatrogenic pharyngeal perforation after ACSS varied depending on whether the cases present early or late after surgery. Although clinical symptoms suggested a pharynx or esophageal injury, definitive diagnosis was challenging. All cases diagnosed either early or late after ACSS underwent surgical repair treatment, except for one case managed conservatively with antibiotics and nasogastric feeding. The overall outcome was favorable for all patients. However, the postoperative follow-up duration was not specified in two cases. In the remaining 10 cases, postoperative follow-up durations were generally short and varied significantly (mean = 4.87 months, median = 1.75 months, range:1 week–24 months).
Conclusion
Iatrogenic pharyngeal injuries resulting from ACSS are extremely rare. They are relatively straightforward to diagnose and can be managed with a multidisciplinary approach. However, their long-term prognosis remains unknown.}

abstract = {This longitudinal study examines the development of motivation among a sample of 261 Chinese EFL student writers in generative AI (GenAI)-supported writing contexts through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Using three-wave data collection, the focus was on how GenAI influences four key motivational constructs: autonomy, competence, relatedness, and identified regulation, and the developmental trajectory of motivation over time. Results from mixed-effects modeling reveal significant time and group interactions, demonstrating that GenAI use leads to substantial motivational gains over time. The results from Gradient Boosting Machine for Time Series (GBMT) indicated that the EFL learners’ motivation development follows curvilinear trajectories, characterized by rapid initial growth that gradually plateaus. Theoretically, the findings extend SDT’s application to AI-mediated learning by demonstrating how GenAI scaffolds psychological needs: fostering competence through adaptive feedback, autonomy via personalized support, and relatedness and identified regulation through simulated social interaction. The study contributes to emerging discourse on technology-enhanced motivation while highlighting the need for proficiency-sensitive implementation strategies in EFL writing contexts.}

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in the realms of creativity and design is becoming increasingly prevalent. This paper seeks to explore a comparative study between AIGC-assisted and traditional methods in automotive seat design. The design of automotive seats is a complex process that integrates considerations of ergonomics, material science, safety, and comfort. Traditional design approaches rely on the experience of designers and preliminary user research to iteratively refine design solutions, a process that is time-consuming and contingent upon the skill level of the designers. By utilizing the Pole Position (ABE) automotive seat design project as a case study and employing the SWOT analysis model, this research compares traditional design methods with those augmented by AIGC. The findings indicate that AIGC-assisted design excels in reducing design timeframes, enhancing design diversity, and increasing user satisfaction. However, traditional methods still hold an edge in deeply understanding and integrating user needs to achieve emotional design. Consequently, this study recommends integration of AIGC-assisted with traditional design approaches, leveraging the strengths of AI to supplement the deficiencies of conventional methods, and harnessing the creative thinking of designers to realize more humanized and personalized automotive seat designs.}

abstract = {Background
The motivational interviewing (MI) approach has been shown to help move ambivalent smokers toward the decision to quit smoking. There have been several attempts to broaden access to MI through text-based chatbots. These typically use scripted responses to client statements, but such nonspecific responses have been shown to reduce effectiveness. Recent advances in natural language processing provide a new way to create responses that are specific to a client’s statements, using a generative language model.
Objective
This study aimed to design, evolve, and measure the effectiveness of a chatbot system that can guide ambivalent people who smoke toward the decision to quit smoking with MI-style generative reflections.
Methods
Over time, 4 different MI chatbot versions were evolved, and each version was tested with a separate group of ambivalent smokers. A total of 349 smokers were recruited through a web-based recruitment platform. The first chatbot version only asked questions without reflections on the answers. The second version asked the questions and provided reflections with an initial version of the reflection generator. The third version used an improved reflection generator, and the fourth version added extended interaction on some of the questions. Participants’ readiness to quit was measured before the conversation and 1 week later using an 11-point scale that measured 3 attributes related to smoking cessation: readiness, confidence, and importance. The number of quit attempts made in the week before the conversation and the week after was surveyed; in addition, participants rated the perceived empathy of the chatbot. The main body of the conversation consists of 5 scripted questions, responses from participants, and (for 3 of the 4 versions) generated reflections. A pretrained transformer-based neural network was fine-tuned on examples of high-quality reflections to generate MI reflections.
Results
The increase in average confidence using the nongenerative version was 1.0 (SD 2.0; P=.001), whereas for the 3 generative versions, the increases ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 (SD 2.0-2.3; P<.001). The extended conversation with improved generative reflections was the only version associated with a significant increase in average importance (0.7, SD 2.0; P<.001) and readiness (0.4, SD 1.7; P=.01). The enhanced reflection and extended conversations exhibited significantly better perceived empathy than the nongenerative conversation (P=.02 and P=.004, respectively). The number of quit attempts did not significantly change between the week before the conversation and the week after across all 4 conversations.
Conclusions
The results suggest that generative reflections increase the impact of a conversation on readiness to quit smoking 1 week later, although a significant portion of the impact seen so far can be achieved by only asking questions without the reflections. These results support further evolution of the chatbot conversation and can serve as a basis for comparison against more advanced versions.}

This study explores the opinions and concerns of international IA experts regarding how ChatGPT may change the future of IA in terms of the benefits and threats it may pose to IA. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with IA experts including consultants, regulators, and academics. The majority of the interviewees were of the view that ChatGPT will help reduce the time and effort required for preliminary data collection and will improve the report quality in terms of formatting and sentence structure etc. However, a number of interviewees also feared that the quality of data in reports and public involvement in IA process may be compromised, chances of plagiarism and bias may increase, and the quality of IA graduates produced by academic institutions may deteriorate. The majority of the experts were afraid that ChatGPT will pose more threats to IA compared to the benefits it may offer. The policymakers, while keeping all these concerns in mind, need to formulate laws, rules, and guidelines regarding the use of ChatGPT in IA in their respective areas as suggested by the interviewees. Future studies may be conducted to evaluate and compare the use of different types of chatbots such as Google’s Bard or Microsoft’s Bing in IA. Additionally, AI related laws and guidelines drafted by IA systems across the globe and their implementation may be evaluated a couple of years later.}

By constructing multi-dimensional building performance index system, combining data dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping technology, the problem of index homogeneity and parameter convergence in traditional evaluation is solved. Through experiments, it is found that the average evaluation accuracy of ACO-RBF and GRA-RBF models is 87.48% and 86.60% respectively, while the fusion model in this paper achieves a performance improvement with an accuracy of 93.31%. The model adopts a three-stage collaborative mechanism -- feature space reconstruction, parameter global optimization and nonlinear decision mapping. It significantly improves the objectivity and reliability of complex building performance evaluation, provides a verifiable technical framework for intelligence-driven design decisions, and promotes the transformation of architectural design scheme evaluation from an experience-dependent paradigm to a data-driven paradigm.}

Bladder carcinoma encompasses various histological subtypes, with shadow cell differentiation (SCD) being an exceptionally rare occurrence, resembling cutaneous pilomatricoma. Herein, we report a case of bladder carcinoma with SCD and aim to elucidate its clinico-pathological characteristics.
Case presentation
A 67-year-old North African man, a heavy smoker, who presented with left lumbar pain, haematuria and dysuria. The physical examination revealed a hypogastric mass. Rectal examination was unremarkable. Radiological examination (Ultrasound and CT) showed a 3 cm bladder tumor, with a suspicious lung and mediastinal tumors. A complete transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) was performed. It showed high-grade urothelial carcinoma with partial squamous differentiation and SCD. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive β-catenin in the peripheral squamous component.
Clinical discussion
Our findings highlight that SCD, a form of keratinization typically observed in the hair matrix, can also manifest in carcinomas with squamous components. The presence of SCD in these tumors suggests a variant of keratinization potentially linked to the squamous components within these neoplasms.
Conclusion
We presented a case bladder carcinoma with SCD, underscoring its unique histopathological features and the importance of recognizing this rare variant for accurate diagnosis and management.}

Barriers to improving outcomes after AKI include limited recognition of AKI by providers, the required transitions of care from the inpatient and outpatient settings, and lack of patient awareness of the AKI event. Gaps in the care of AKI survivors may be improved with enhanced education for providers and patients. Some tools focused on early detection of AKI and improving AKI management have been developed with variable success in addressing adverse outcomes. Significant heterogeneity within the AKI population and complexities of care coordination continue to hinder programs focused on improving AKI survivorship. On the horizon, promising programs are emerging that may overcome these barriers by offering an individualized, patient-centered approach to AKI survivorship by integrating technological advances and multidisciplinary support. Greater emphasis is being placed on ensuring that tactics for AKI management can be implemented beyond the nephrology subspecialty. These programs can potentially prevent AKI, optimize recovery, and increase patient satisfaction. This review discusses the current and emerging educational resources for AKI survivors and their providers.}

abstract = {Introduction
Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) affects almost half of patients with chronic hemodialysis. ACKD is recognized as a predisposing condition for renal carcinoma, particularly in patients undergoing long-term dialysis. Acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (ACD-RCC) is a subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occurring solely in patients with ACKD. ACD-RCC was first introduced as a distinct entity in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of renal tumors and retained in the 2022 update. However, it remains underdiagnosed due to histologic overlap with other subtypes. We aimed to study the clinicopathological features of the entity.
Case presentation
We reported the case of a 44-year-old patient who presented a hemorrhagic shock of suspected renal origin. A scan showed no renal tumor. The patient experienced a second episode of hemorrhagic shock. A hemostatic nephrectomy was necessary. Microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of ACD-RCC. The patient died three days post-operatively.
Clinical discussion
ACD-RCC is a common but under recognized entity with specific clinical, histopathological, and evolutionary features.
Conclusion
Enhanced recognition of ACD-RCC and its features by pathologists is mandatory to ensure accurate histopathological diagnosis and appropriate clinical management.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Native American (American Indian/Alaska Native) youth have the highest rates of suicide and suicide clusters in the United States, and appropriate responses are lacking. This study examined protective and risk factors for suicide in a remote Northern Plains reservation with a recent cluster.
Methods
A mixed-methods study was conducted on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, Montana, in 2022 using a community-engaged approach. Quantitative results from the 251-item questionnaire are presented, which were derived from a culturally adapted socio-ecological model. Aaniiih and Nakoda youth 14–24 years of age, living on/near Fort Belknap were recruited.
Findings
In total, 197 youth completed the questionnaire; average age was 16.6 years (SD = 2.60). One hundred (51%) youth were female and 90 (46%) male; 6.1% of data points were missing. Positive family relationships, communal mastery, benevolent childhood experiences, and emotional intelligence were protective, decreasing odds of suicide ideation. Childhood and family risk factors correlated with increased odds of suicidal ideation, including verbal abuse, low community support, sexual abuse, and witnessing community violence. Utilizing multivariable modeling, emotional intelligence (protective factor), and early initiation of substance use, verbal abuse, PTSD, and historical losses (risk factors) were significant factors for suicide ideation, when controlling for all other factors.
Interpretation
Adverse childhood experiences, early initiation of substance use, and PTSD increase suicide ideation and attempts. When youth experience positive and supportive family relationships, odds of suicide ideation are lower, which highlight pivotal areas for intervention and response.

A study was conducted from August 2022 to September 2023 at the Safdarjung Hospital, a reference health facility in New Delhi, India. Standard antibody-targeting assays were used for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. All Leptospira spp. infection cases were tested for dengue, malaria, chikungunya, scrub typhus, and typhoid using standard kits. Data were analysed with SPSS v16 software, and statistical significance was set at p-value < 0.05. Of the 4259 patients enrolled, only 4 (0.09 %) were reactive for bacteria Leptospira spp., and this prevalence rate was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from those reported before COVID-19 at the same study site. The patients mainly females, were between 15 – 33 years of age. Common symptoms included fever, generalised body aches, myalgia, and nausea/vomiting. This study underscores a low circulation of Leptospira spp. Delhi, and no impact of COVID-19 on the burden. Also, there is a need to conduct community studies to confirm this hospital-based evidence.}

This technological shift allows pathologists to analyze tissue morphology digitally, improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis. Recent advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled research in digital pathology, with applications such as tumor detection, tissue segmentation, and telemedicine consultations. Despite the promising outlook, challenges remain, especially in managing the vast volume and complexity of WSI data. Information retrieval (IR) systems, which have long facilitated the structured search of clinical data, are increasingly relevant in this context, particularly for image-based searches like Content-based image retrieval. IR systems, including both text and image searches, enable rapid access to patient information and disease patterns, significantly supporting diagnostic workflows and personalized treatment. The emergence of large deep models and foundation models further complements traditional IR systems, offering new frameworks for integrating AI-driven insights with efficient information access. However, the synergy between AI models and conventional IR approaches is essential to ensure transparency, accuracy, and clinical utility in digital pathology.}

keywords = {vaping, social media, Mexican American, college students, marketing, acculturation, protocol, artificial intelligence},
abstract = {Background
The tobacco industry has a history of targeting minority communities, including Hispanic individuals, by promoting vaping through social media. This marketing increases the risk of vaping among Hispanic young adults, including college students. In Texas, college enrollment among Mexican Americans has significantly increased over recent years. However, little research exists on the link between social media and vaping and the underlying mechanisms (ie, outcome expectations, attitudes, and beliefs) explaining how vaping-related social media impacts vaping among Mexican American college students. Moreover, there is limited knowledge about how acculturation moderates the association between social media and vaping. Hispanic individuals, particularly Mexican Americans, are the largest ethnic group in Texas colleges; thus, it is crucial to understand the impact of social media and acculturation on their vaping behaviors.
Objective
We outline the mixed methods used in Project Vaping, Acculturation, and Media Study (VAMoS). We present descriptive analyses of the participants enrolled in the study, highlight methodological strengths, and discuss lessons learned during the implementation of the study protocol related to recruitment and data collection and management.
Methods
Project VAMoS is being conducted with Mexican American students attending 1 of 6 Texas-based colleges: University of Texas (UT) Arlington, UT Dallas, UT El Paso, UT Rio Grande Valley, UT San Antonio, and the University of Houston System. This project has 2 phases. Phase 1 included an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study and qualitative one-on-one interviews (years 1-2), and phase 2 includes cognitive interviews and a 4-wave web-based survey study (years 2-4) with objective assessments of vaping-related social media content to which participants are exposed. Descriptive statistics summarized participants’ characteristics in the EMA and web-based survey.
Results
The EMA analytic sample comprised 51 participants who were primarily female (n=37, 73%), born in the United States (n=48, 94%), of middle socioeconomic status (n=38, 75%), and aged 21 years on average (SD 1.7 years). The web-based survey cohort comprised 1492 participants self-identifying as Mexican American; Tejano, Tejana, or Tejanx; or Chicano, Chicana, or Chicanx heritage who were primarily female (n=1042, 69.8%), born in the United States (n=1366, 91.6%), of middle socioeconomic status (n=1174, 78.7%), and aged 20.1 years on average at baseline (SD 2.2 years). Of the baseline cohort, the retention rate in wave 2 was 74.7% (1114/1492).
Conclusions
Project VAMoS is one of the first longitudinal mixed methods studies exploring the impact of social media and acculturation on vaping behaviors specifically targeting Mexican American college students. Its innovative approach to objectively measuring social media exposure and engagement related to vaping enhances the validity of self-reported data beyond what national surveys can achieve. The results can be used to develop evidence-based, culturally relevant interventions to prevent vaping among this rapidly growing minority population.

The acute pleural empyema guidelines recommend thoracoscopic-assisted surgery. However, there is no clear guideline for chest tube removal after surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the duration from surgery to chest tube removal, identify associated factors.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 95 patients having non-fistulous empyema due to pulmonary infection caused by common bacteria who underwent surgery at our hospital from January 2011 to March 2023. Postoperative lavage was conducted until two consecutive pleural fluid cultures were negative. The chest tube was clamped and removed if there was no exacerbation of fever or inflammatory findings for 2 days.
Results
Seventy-eight patients (82.1%) were men with a mean age of 72 years. The median duration from surgery to chest tube removal was 14 (interquartile range: 8–22) days. In the multivariable analysis, the independent factors associated with the duration from surgery to chest tube removal were lower prognostic nutritional index (hazard ratio [HR], 1.753; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.101–2.792; P = 0.018) and positive preoperative pleural fluid culture (HR, 1.867; 95% CI, 1.069–3.261; P = 0.028). Ninety-two (96.8%) patients did not require additional treatment or rehospitalization.
Conclusions
Positive preoperative pleural fluid culture and nutritional status were significant independent factors associated with the duration from surgery to chest tube removal. Almost all patients did not require chest tube reinsertion in our approach. These findings using our approach may guide optimal management of chest tube removal in non-fistulous empyema.}

abstract = {Background
Lifestyle interventions have been acknowledged as effective strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the accessibility of conventional face-to-face interventions is often limited. Digital health intervention has been suggested as a potential solution to overcome the limitation. Despite this, there remains a significant gap in understanding the effectiveness of digital health for individuals with prediabetes, particularly in reducing T2DM incidence and reverting to normoglycemia.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of different intervention modes of digital health, face-to-face, and blended interventions, particularly the benefits of digital health intervention, in reducing T2DM incidence and facilitating the reversion to normoglycemia in adults with prediabetes compared to the usual care.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search in 9 electronic databases, namely MEDLINE, Embase, ACP Journal Club, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Clinical Answers, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment, and NHS Economic Evaluation Database through Ovid, from the inception to October 2024. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that studied the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in adults with prediabetes. The overall intervention effect was synthesized using a random-effects model. The I² statistic was used to assess heterogeneity across the RCTs. We performed a subgroup analysis to explore the effectiveness of digital health, face-to-face, and blended interventions compared with the control group, which received usual care.
Results
From an initial 7868 records retrieved from 9 databases, we identified 54 articles from 31 RCTs. Our analysis showed that face-to-face interventions demonstrated a significant 46% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (risk ratio [RR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.47-0.63; I²=43%; P<.001), and a 46% increase in the reversion to normoglycemia (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.91; I²=82%; P=.006), when compared with the control group. On the other hand, digital health interventions, compared with the control group, were associated with a 12% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.01; I²=0.6%; P=.06). Moreover, the blended interventions combining digital and face-to-face interventions suggested a 37% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81;I²<0.01%; P<.001) and an 87% increase in the reversion to normoglycemia (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.30-2.69; I²=23%; P=.001). However, no significant effect on the reversal of prediabetes to normoglycemia was observed from the digital health interventions.
Conclusions
Face-to-face interventions have consistently demonstrated promising effectiveness in both reductions in T2DM incidence and reversion to normoglycemia in adults with prediabetes. However, the effectiveness of digital health interventions in these areas has not been sufficiently proven. Given these results, further research is required to provide more definitive evidence of digital health and blended interventions in T2DM prevention in the future.

abstract = {Objectives
Most adult patients in England now have access to their primary care electronic health record (EHR), including free-text consultation notes, via the NHS App or other online services. As EHRs were not designed for patient audiences, this study aimed to explore patients’ and carers’ perspectives and understanding of simulated consultation notes.
Methods
One interview and five focus groups were conducted with 26 patients and carers from a purposive sample of underserved communities in England between April and May 2023. Participants’ understanding and views were elicited regarding five vignettes about patient consultation scenarios and corresponding simulated primary care EHR entries. Verbatim transcripts were analysed inductively using thematic analysis.
Results
Most participants struggled to fully understand the simulated consultation notes, particularly medical acronyms, clinician shorthand and non-clinical abbreviations. Participants also identified issues which may cause unintended offence or anxiety, and made suggestions about how EHRs may be improved to meet the needs of patient audiences and maintain positive patient-clinician relationships.
Conclusions
Opening up online record access to include patient audiences necessitates a significant cultural shift in the way that consultation notes are written and used. Participants proposed technological and documentation adaptations to enhance understanding, support diverse patient needs and maintain positive patient-clinician relationships.
Practice implications
To fully realise the benefits of patient online records access, it is important for consultation notes to be written in a way that patients find meaningful, while maintaining their clinical integrity. To optimise NHS England’s investment in this policy and avoid exacerbating health inequalities, it is essential to ensure all patients can access the benefits of online access to their EHR. Healthcare professionals need to be supported to manage the challenges of writing consultation notes for patient audiences, while continuing to maintain effective clinical care.}

The aim is to reduce impacts across the battery pack’s lifecycle, following the eco-design practices and standards by enhancing the durability of materials and components and simplifying their recovery and recycling. The improvements are being carried out within the scope of a European Project, which aims to enhance the durability of materials and components and make it easier to recover and recycle them. The Lean Design-for-eXcellence methodology was used to identify areas for potential improvement in the pack’s design, namely considering Design-for-Manufacturing, Design-for-Second Life, and Design-for-Recyclability. The results show potential opportunities to improve the efficiency of control, safety, mechanical, and electrical systems across different domains. Key areas for improvement that could significantly enhance overall system sustainability performance include reducing weight, optimizing coolant flow, and expediting disassembly and assembly processes.}

abstract = {Background
Radiology reports are typically written in a free-text format, making clinical information difficult to extract and use. Recently, the adoption of structured reporting (SR) has been recommended by various medical societies thanks to the advantages it offers, e.g. standardization, completeness, and information retrieval. We propose a pipeline to extract information from Italian free-text radiology reports that fits with the items of the reference SR registry proposed by a national society of interventional and medical radiology, focusing on CT staging of patients with lymphoma.
Methods
Our work aims to leverage the potential of Natural Language Processing and Transformer-based models to deal with automatic SR registry filling. With the availability of 174 Italian radiology reports, we investigate a rule-free generative Question Answering approach based on the Italian-specific version of T5: IT5. To address information content discrepancies, we focus on the six most frequently filled items in the annotations made on the reports: three categorical (multichoice), one free-text (free-text), and two continuous numerical (factual). In the preprocessing phase, we encode also information that is not supposed to be entered. Two strategies (batch-truncation and ex-post combination) are implemented to comply with the IT5 context length limitations. Performance is evaluated in terms of strict accuracy, f1, and format accuracy, and compared with the widely used GPT-3.5 Large Language Model. Unlike multichoice and factual, free-text answers do not have 1-to-1 correspondence with their reference annotations. For this reason, we collect human-expert feedback on the similarity between medical annotations and generated free-text answers, using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire (evaluating the criteria of correctness and completeness).
Results
The combination of fine-tuning and batch splitting allows IT5 ex-post combination to achieve notable results in terms of information extraction of different types of structured data, performing on par with GPT-3.5. Human-based assessment scores of free-text answers show a high correlation with the AI performance metrics f1 (Spearman's correlation coefficients>0.5, p-values<0.001) for both IT5 ex-post combination and GPT-3.5. The latter is better at generating plausible human-like statements, even if it systematically provides answers even when they are not supposed to be given.
Conclusions
In our experimental setting, a fine-tuned Transformer-based model with a modest number of parameters (i.e., IT5, 220 M) performs well as a clinical information extraction system for automatic SR registry filling task. It can extract information from more than one place in the report, elaborating it in a manner that complies with the response specifications provided by the SR registry (for multichoice and factual items), or that closely approximates the work of a human-expert (free-text items); with the ability to discern when an answer is supposed to be given or not to a user query.}

abstract = {Introduction
Foregut duplication cysts are rare mediastinal malformations that can cause life-threatening respiratory compromise in early infancy and are often misdiagnosed on initial imaging.
Presentation of case
A three-month-old boy, born at 37 weeks, developed progressive respiratory distress and cyanosis unresponsive to pneumonia therapy. Chest radiography suggested a hiatal hernia, whereas thoracic ultrasound showed a multiloculated cyst. Contrast-enhanced CT delineated a thick-walled paracardial cyst crossing the diaphragm and a smaller posterior chest-wall cyst. On hospital day 8 a right thoraco-abdominal approach allowed en-bloc removal of the 6 × 4 cm lesion with mucosectomy of the adherent esophageal segment and excision of the posterior cyst. Histology confirmed gastric-type foregut duplication. The infant was extubated on postoperative day 1, reached full feeds by day 7, and was discharged asymptomatic on day 18.
Discussion
This case illustrates the diagnostic pitfalls of mediastinal foregut duplication cysts masquerading as more common entities such as hiatal hernia. Multimodal imaging—particularly ultrasound and CT—was pivotal in defining lesion extent and guiding timely surgery. Complete thoraco-abdominal excision achieved rapid recovery and mitigated risks of infection, hemorrhage, or malignant transformation reported with incomplete resection.
Conclusion
Neonates with unexplained respiratory distress and mediastinal masses should prompt consideration of foregut duplication cysts. Early cross-sectional imaging and definitive surgical excision are essential for preventing complications and ensuring excellent long-term outcomes.}

Introduction
Chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) is a major cause of disability globally. Due to the multifactorial nature of CNSLBP, non-pharmacological management such as exercise therapy, has been recommended as a first-line treatment. This pilot study examined the acceptability and clinical impact of a novel physiotherapist-led movement-based intervention for people with CNSLBP.
Methods
A mixed-methods study design was used. Twenty-nine adults with CNSLBP were allocated to a 12-week movement-based program (Motum) or waitlist control. The intervention comprised 12 sessions based on fundamental movement patterns and motor control principles. The primary outcome was acceptability and secondary measures were balance, pain, function, self-efficacy and kinesiophobia. Semi-structured interviews explored participants experiences of the intervention.
Results
The intervention was acceptable to participants with all sub-domains (affective attitude, perceived effectiveness, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, self-efficacy, and ethicality) scoring ‘highly acceptable’ (p <.001), except burden which scored ‘acceptable’ (p <.02). The intervention demonstrated large positive changes for improving fear avoidance of movement (Hedges g = .92) and balance (g = 1.04) and smaller positive effects on pain and function (g = .62) and self-efficacy (g = .23), compared to controls. Themes emerging from qualitative data with 10 participants were: 1) acceptability of program structure; 2) positive impacts attributed to the intervention; and 3) barriers to engagement.
Conclusion
Motum was an acceptable intervention and demonstrated positive impacts across a range of clinical outcomes. While these findings are encouraging, further research through mature study designs (such as randomised controlled trials) are required to substantiate these findings.}

abstract = {In this review, I show how Generative AI (GAI) utterly transforms how we represent, access, expose and cover, find and lose, sanitise and toxify, use and abuse, and communicate with, the past. The term ‘collective memory’ has become common parlance for an array of constructive and nefarious uses of the shared past. It is often seen as related to the lifespan of an individual, or a group or generation who lived through or experienced a particular era or event, affording some kind of shared experience that is strengthened by the presence of or connection to others in common. In this way, the collective, as with an individual's memory has its limits, it dies out. However, particularly since the late twentieth century, the term has acquired a mythical form, with publics, institutions and scholars, imagining in its nature, function and extended duration, for a variety of ends. These imaginaries are often tied to assumptions around the unifying nature of the technologies and media of memory of the day. I argue here that today's agentic turn by contrast offers no such prospects for collective memory, mythical or otherwise. Rather, Generative and Agentic AI's extracting, remixing and replaying of interactions, shards you and your identities anew, rendering it difficult to imagine a group, experience or event, around which a collective memory could cohere. Instead, individuals and societies are subject to a black box memory of impossible provenance, where human agency in shaping what the past becomes is in retreat.}

abstract = {This study presents PuppyCodeReview, an AI-based system designed to support code review activities in programming education. While peer code review is increasingly emphasized in computer science curricula, its effectiveness in university classrooms remains uncertain, especially among novice programmers. PuppyCodeReview aims to address this gap by automating the review process and providing structured feedback on design, functionality, complexity, and common code smells. To evaluate the system’s impact, a four-week experiment was conducted in a data structures course at a university in Taiwan. Students were divided into control and experimental groups; the control group used a standard web interface, while the experimental group utilized the AI-assisted PuppyCodeReview system for the same tasks. Cognitive load was measured before and after the intervention. Results indicated that although cognitive load increased in both groups, the increase was significantly smaller for students using PuppyCodeReview, suggesting the system reduced mental effort associated with code review. These findings highlight the potential of AI-assisted tools in making peer review more accessible and pedagogically effective for novice programmers.}
