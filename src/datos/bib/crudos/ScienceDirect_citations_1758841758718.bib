abstract = {Salmon farming plays an important role in the Norwegian food industry, supplying a large portion of the world's salmon. Despite its economic importance, salmon farming faces unique biological challenges impacting the health and welfare of the fish. These factors limit the growth of salmon and the full economic potential of salmon farms, highlighting the need for advanced techniques in aquaculture to enhance productivity and sustainability. A key technical challenge is the unavailability of effective monitoring tools, leading to greater difficulties assessing the condition of salmon in water compared to the assessment of the animal stock on land-based farms. To improve the observability of salmon farms, we designed and created a computer-vision based approach for salmon breathing rate estimation (SaBRE), which allows the automatic monitoring of the respiration frequency of each individual salmon in a group of fish, seamlessly covering the entire workflow from video-stream input to the final data output (end-to-end). We thoroughly evaluated the capabilities of our method in two ways. Firstly, we performed a quantitative analysis of the constituent modules of SaBRE, revealing that all modules were highly accurate, including a salmon re-identification module that achieved an accuracy of 99.51 %. Secondly, we analyzed data from a salmon experiment with SaBRE, demonstrating that our algorithm provides high-quality respiration frequency information that can be compared with other types of experimental data to infer biological relationships. For the fish in our experiment, we observed that the ranking of the respiration frequencies in individual salmon remains relatively unchanged both in the short term and over longer periods (i.e., a salmon with a high breathing rate consistently remains among those with the highest rates, regardless of changes in the environment). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation (Pearson correlation coefficients with r values between −0.61 and −0.90 and p values below 0.01) was observed between our algorithm's estimated respiration frequency and the dissolved oxygen (dO2) content in the water. In addition, the average breathing rate of the salmon was observed to increase in response to incidents potentially causing stress.}

abstract = {Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) is a non-invasive hybrid biomedical imaging technology that combines the advantages of optics and acoustics to provide high-resolution biological tissue information at the submicron scale. Conventional PAM suffers from slow imaging speeds during high-resolution imaging due to the limitations of the laser pulse repetition rate. Although extending the sampling step size (i.e., sparse sampling) can enhance imaging speed and alleviate data collection demands, it might compromise image quality by causing distortions or the loss of fine details. This study presents an enhanced method based on the mean-reverting diffusion model for sparse-sampling high-resolution reconstruction in PAM to address the problem. The model captures prior knowledge of the data distribution by simulating the degradation process from a fully-sampled image to a sparsely-sampled image contaminated with Gaussian noise (mean state). The learned prior is then utilized to iteratively reconstruct a fully-sampled image from the sparsely-sampled one. The results indicate that the IR-SDE method achieves high-resolution sparse-sampling reconstruction for mouse in vivo blood vessel experimental data compared with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution method (RL Deconv) and CycleGAN method. Under super-sparse sampling (sampling ratios of about 0.4 %), the IR-SDE method reaches an SSIM of 0.742 and a PSNR of 24.22 dB using only about 0.4 % of the fully-sampled pixels, improving 0.597 (∼412 %) in SSIM and 11.51 dB (∼91 %) in PSNR, compared to U-Net method. Even in the case of reconstructing sparsely-sampled PAM images obtained from real-world scenarios without prior training or extensive trainable data, the proposed method still demonstrates satisfactory reconstruction performance. The proposed method is anticipated to improve reconstruction speed and imaging speed, achieving high-resolution reconstruction at super-sparse sampling.}

This shift has highlighted the importance of student AI literacy, which enables students to harness the power of AI tools and navigate the complexities of L2 writing more effectively and responsibly. Despite its significance, research on student AI literacy in L2 writing remains scarce, and there is a notable absence of instruments to measure, diagnose and track its development among L2 student writers. Heeding the call for developing psychometrically validated scales tailored to specific domains or disciplines, this study aims to develop and validate the L2 Writing-Student AI Literacy Scale (L2W-SAILS) for teachers and students to operationalise and assess student AI literacy in L2 writing. Building on relevant seminal works, this study proposed a four-dimension AI literacy framework, including ‘understanding’, ‘use’, ‘evaluation’, and ‘ethics’. Guided by this framework, a 22-item self-reported questionnaire on student AI literacy was developed and validated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis involving respectively 435 and 350 Chinese university students. The results confirm that the L2W-SAILS is a reliable measurement scale for assessing student AI literacy in L2 writing, and the proposed four-dimension model is a robust representation of student AI literacy. The findings also contribute to a pedagogical framework that informs AI-assisted teaching and learning of L2 writing.}

Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) aim to provide psychological support during critical moments in daily life.
Objective
This preregistered study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a social support JITAI for individuals with subclinical and clinical levels of depressive symptoms awaiting psychotherapy. Triggered by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports, the intervention encouraged participants to activate their (digital) social support networks.
Methods
A total of 25 participants completed 2689 EMA surveys and received 377 JITAIs over an 18-day intervention period, including a microrandomized trial, to compare 4 strategies to trigger an intervention: fixed cutoff points of distress variables, personalized thresholds (through Shewhart control charts) of distress variables, momentary support need, and no intervention.
Results
The results showed high feasibility, with participants completing 85.37% (2689/3150) of the EMA surveys, exhibiting a low study-related attrition rate (7%; total attrition rate was 17%), and reporting minimal technical issues. Engagement and perceived helpfulness were heterogeneous and moderate, with participants seeking support in one-third of the instances after an intervention was triggered instances. JITAIs triggered by self-reported need for support were rated as more appropriately timed, helpful, and effective for promoting support-seeking behavior compared to those based on distress indicators, despite being triggered less frequently. Barriers, such as time constraints and perceived unavailability of support providers, likely affected support-seeking behavior, as indicated by additional qualitative analyses. Exploratory effectiveness analyses indicated Cohen d effect sizes between 0.06 and 0.14 in reducing distress after JITAIs were received.
Conclusions
The findings of this study demonstrate that a social support JITAI is feasible to implement, with high compliance and minimal technical issues. However, further research is needed to evaluate the JITAI’s effectiveness and optimize trigger strategies in addressing individual needs for and barriers to engagement.}

One hundred and five 10-week-old quail cocks were acclimated and divided into five treatment groups: negative control – G1, DEX-treated (20 mgL−1 of drinking water) – G2, DEX + VE (180 mg kg diet−1) – G3; DEX + Se (0.3 mg kg diet−1) – G4; and DEX + VE (180 mg kg diet−1) + Se (0.3 mg kg diet−1) – G5. The birds received their respective treatments over 21 days, and various performance, hematological, and semen quality parameters were measured. Results indicated that DEX treatment significantly reduced weight gain (WG) and feed intake (P < 0.05). Supplementation with VE and Se, individually and combined, ameliorated these effects, with groups G3, G4, and G5 showing similar WG to the control. Hematological analysis revealed significant increases (P < 0.05) in packed cell volume, hemoglobin, and white blood cell count in DEX-treated groups compared to G1. Treatment did not affect blood glucose and cholesterol levels (P ≥ 0.05). Plasma antioxidant assays showed elevated superoxide dismutase and catalase functions and reduced malondialdehyde levels in G3, G4, and G5 compared to G2, indicating reduced oxidative stress. No marked differences were seen in the plasma glutathione peroxidase activities across groups. Sperm motility was impaired in the DEX-only group but improved (P < 0.05) with antioxidant supplementation. In conclusion, dietary VE and Se effectively mitigated the negative impacts of DEX-induced stress on growth, antioxidant status, and spermatozoa motility in Japanese quail cocks. VE and Se supplementation could be beneficial in enhancing the welfare and productivity of poultry under stress.}

Short-term land-use changes over seven time windows encompassing the last three decades (1992–2020) were investigated in metropolitan Athens (Greece), a mono-centric region experiencing complex economic downturns. Based on diachronic land-use maps with homogeneous spatial resolution and nomenclature derived from ESA Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI), a change detection analysis was run considering mean patch size, distance from downtown, and specific entropy-based metrics of landscape diversification (Shannon-Wiener H’ diversity index and Pielou J evenness index). Results of a canonical correlation analysis document differential intensity and spatial direction of change during expansions and recessions associated with distinctive socio-demographic profiles. Metropolitan growth followed a radio-centric (land-saving) model during economic expansions with intense urbanization of fringe land. A more dispersed settlement model – reflecting urban sprawl – was associated with economic stagnations, involving land at progressively distant locations from downtown. Landscape diversification was higher under stagnations and lower during expansions.}

However, generative AI models and AIGC have exacerbated several societal challenges such as security threats (e.g., misinformation), trust issues, ethical concerns, and intellectual property regulation, calling for effective detection methods and a better understanding of AI-generated vs. human-written content. In this paper, we focus on AI-generated texts produced by large language models (LLMs) and extend prior detection methods by proposing a novel framework that combines semantic information and linguistic features. Based on potential semantic and linguistic differences in AI vs. human writing, we design our Semantic-Linguistic-Detector (SemLinDetector) framework by integrating a transformer-based semantic encoder and a linguistic encoder with parallel linguistic representations. By comparing a series of benchmark models on datasets collected from various LLMs and human writers in multiple domains, our experiments show that the proposed detection framework outperforms other benchmarks in a consistent and robust manner. Moreover, our model interpretability analysis showcases our framework's potential to help understand the reasoning behind prediction outcomes and identify patterns of differences in AI-generated and human-written content. Our research adds to the growing space of GenAI by proposing an effective and responsible detection system to address the risks and challenges of GenAI, offering implications for researchers and practitioners to better understand and regulate AIGC.}

Three phased experiments evaluated juvenile growth and survival performance by: offering two types of seaweed-based supplemental feeds (Sargassum sp. and Gracilaria verrucosa) both processed by fermentation and pulverisation (Experiment 1); evaluating three stocking densities (25, 35 and 45 individuals per m2) using the best-performing diet from Experiment 1 (Experiment 2); and upscaling to commercial-level culture in three 400 m2 earthen ponds (Experiment 3). Fermented diets were prepared using a probiotic mixture (Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis) added to ground, dried seaweed; while the pulverised diets were offered as a ground powder (350–450 µm particle sizes). Sandfish offered fermented Sargassum and Gracilaria reached 35.0% and 29.7% heavier mean final weights (18.18 ± 0.19 g and 16.81 ± 0.08 g, respectively), compared to their pulverised equivalents (11.82 ± 1.09 g across both seaweed species, p < 0.05) after 84 days of culture. Similar trends in growth rate (AGR and SGR) were evident. Fermented Sargassum sp. was therefore selected for subsequent experiments. During Experiment 2 the lowest density tested of 25 ind./m2 yielded the highest weight gain after 84 days, with juveniles 29.2% and 44.0% heavier respectively (final weight=18.20 ± 1.31 g), cf. 35 and 45 ind./m2, respectively (final weights=12.90 ± 0.71 and 10.20 ± 0.70 g, respectively). Growth at 25 ind./m2 was 15.7% faster (SGR=2.61 ± 0.09 g/day) compared to 35 ind./m2 (SGR=2.20 ± 0.07 g/day), and 26.5% faster relative to 45 ind./m2 (SGR=1.92±0.10 g/day). Sandfish grown in earthen ponds during Experiment 3 attained a final mean weight of 241.21 ± 0.84 g after 180 days. Final mean weights, weight gained and SGR (1.76 ± 0.06%/day) were not significantly different between ponds (p > 0.05). Valuable new information has been generated for further development of supplemental feeding of sandfish, and results here demonstrate high technical feasibility to support short cropping, with optimisation of this culture model required.}

Circulating lipids and lipoproteins mediate cardiovascular risk, however routine plasma lipid biochemistry provides limited information on pro-atherogenic remnant particles.
OBJECTIVE
We analysed plasma lipoprotein subclasses including very low-density and intermediate-density lipoprotein (VLDL and IDL); and assessed their associations with health and cardiometabolic risk.
METHODS
From 1,976 community-dwelling adults aged 45–67 years, 114/1071 women (10.6%) and 153/905 men (16.9%) were categorised as very healthy. Fasting plasma lipoprotein profiles comprising 112 parameters were measured using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and associations with health status and cardiometabolic risk factors examined.
RESULTS
HDL cholesterol was higher, and IDL and VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides lower, in very healthy women compared to other women, and women compared to men. IDL and VLDL cholesterol and triglyceride were lower in very healthy men compared to other men. HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I were inversely, and IDL and VLDL cholesterol, apoB-100, and apoB-100/apoA-I ratio directly associated with body mass index (BMI) in women and men. In women, LDL, IDL and VLDL cholesterol increased with age. Women with diabetes and cardiovascular disease had higher cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and free cholesterol across IDL and VLDL fractions, with similar trends for men with diabetes.
CONCLUSION
Lipoprotein subclasses and density fractions, and their lipid and apolipoprotein constituents, are differentially distributed by sex, health status and BMI. Very healthy women and men are distinguished by favorable lipoprotein profiles, particularly lower concentrations of VLDL and IDL, providing reference intervals for comparison with general populations and adults with cardiometabolic risk factors.}

One is the ability to adsorb body odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the microclimate between the skin and the textile layer, and the other is the ability of the textile to kill and prevent the growth of odor-causing bacteria. However, most of the finishes use one of the two approaches, which lowers the efficacy of the finish. In this work, we have reported the use of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks, viz. ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs), which, when applied to polyester fabrics, serve a dual purpose of both adsorbing the odor and imparting antimicrobial activity. ZIF-8 NPs with an average size of ∼60 nm were synthesized by a water-based procedure at ambient temperature and applied in small concentrations on PET fabric using a commercial binder. The ZIF-8 functionalized polyester fabric (ZIF-8@PET Fabric) was characterized for its morphology and functionality. The fabrics were found to adsorb high concentrations of three odor-causing model compounds, such as isovaleric acid, indole, and nonenal, and could effectively inhibit the bacterial growth of E. coli and S. aureus. Further, the fabric functionality was retained even after several wash cycles and could be reused repeatedly.}

The investigation was conducted using an online questionnaire, which gathered responses from participants in the three countries. The survey consisted of questions that assessed participants’ experiences with AI tools, their views on AI-generated art in various forms, and their ethical concerns regarding its use. The results indicate that participants in China are generally more optimistic about the value of AI-generated art, prioritizing the quality of the final product over ethical concerns. In contrast, participants in the U.S. and Japan emphasize the importance of human creativity and express skepticism about AI art, primarily due to ethical concerns such as misinformation and intellectual property issues. While Chinese participants focus on data privacy and intellectual property protection, U.S. participants are more concerned with misinformation and fake content. Japan, despite having the least experience with AI tools, presents attitudes that often fall between the positions of the U.S. and China. This study provides valuable insights into cross-cultural differences in attitudes toward AI art, offering guidance for educators, policymakers, and AI developers on integrating AI into the art and design sectors in a sustainable, ethical, and culturally adaptive manner.}

Herpetospermum pedunculosum (Ser.) C.B. Clarke (HP), a traditional Tibetan medicine used to treat hepatobiliary diseases, was confirmed that lignans-enriched ethyl acetate extract of HP (EAHP) could alleviate the hepatic injury by modern pharmacological evidence. However, the effects and potential mechanisms of EAHP against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are still unknown.
Aim of the study
To reveal the effects of EAHP on NAFLD and explore the potential mechanisms from the perspective of lipidomics and transcriptomics.
Materials and methods
UPLC‒Q–TOF‒MS analysis was carried out to investigate the chemical components of EAHP. A Choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined, high fat diet (CDAHFD) was used to establish a NAFLD mouse model. The anti-NAFLD effects of various dosages of EAHP were evaluated by biochemical indexes and histological analysis. Hepatic lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis and multiple bioinformatics methods were used to screen biomarkers and signaling pathways. The levels of the corresponding genes were verified by qPCR.
Results
36 kinds of compounds were identified by UPLC‒Q–TOF‒MS analysis. Oral treatment with EAHP significantly decrease the liver index and the levels of ALT and AST in the serum. The measurements lipid content and Oil Red O staining results suggested that EAHP ameliorated lipid metabolism disorders by reducing the content of TG and LDL-C, increasing HDL-C in the liver. H&E staining and ELISA revealed that EAHP restored hepatic inflammatory infiltration and decrease the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and increase IL-10 in the serum. Lipidomic analysis showed that EAHP could regulate CDAHFD-induced lipid metabolic disorder. The different lipid metabolites included TG, phosphatidyl choline (PC), diacylglycerol (DG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), ceramide (Cer). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Bmp8b, Nbl1, Rgma, Sphk1, Thbs1, and Ugt8a were important regulators, which were associated with TGF-β signaling pathway and sphingolipid metabolism. The expressions of above genes detected by were qPCR consistent with transcriptomic data.
Conclusions
The ameliorative effects of EAHP on NAFLD are potentially attributable to the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism and TGF-β signaling pathway, etc., which results in abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammatory response.}

Its integration with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-driven signaling networks positions it as a cornerstone of PDAC biology and a compelling therapeutic target. The products of the pathway (sterols and isoprenoids) support key processes such as membrane biogenesis, protein prenylation, and immune evasion, facilitating tumor adaptation to the harsh microenvironment. Despite extensive research, therapeutic resistance and metabolic plasticity present considerable challenges in targeting this pathway. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biochemical regulation of the mevalonate pathway in PDAC, its crosstalk with key oncogenic signaling networks, and emerging therapeutic strategies. In addition, we highlight critical knowledge gaps, including the complex regulatory crosstalk of the pathway with oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and nutrient-sensing pathways, and the mechanisms by which metabolic rewiring modulates tumor-immune interactions and therapy resistance. By integrating insights from pre-clinical and clinical studies, we highlighted promising novel combination therapies, including statins, bisphosphonates, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) inhibitors, as well as the potential for precision medicine approaches targeting mevalonate pathway vulnerabilities. Addressing these challenges may provide new avenues for improving therapeutic outcomes in PDAC.}

The prevalence of explicitly coding-oriented methods tailored to specific free-form surface features has led to a lack of comprehensive exploration of the broader intrinsic patterns of these surfaces, thereby limiting the overall generality of these methods. Therefore, we introduce GridGAN to uncover the inherent patterns in the data and facilitate the grid partitioning for free-form surfaces. First, we innovatively propose utilizing the curvature and height cloud maps of free-form surfaces as inputs to GridGAN to obtain the corresponding grid structures. Then, we utilize self-developed codes to facilitate the data dimension conversion and obtain the desired free-form grid structures. Lastly, the exceptional merits of our proposed method have been thoroughly substantiated through 12 test samples and 2 cases and a comprehensive evaluation that seamlessly combines qualitative evaluation (expert perception) with quantitative evaluation (FID score and geometric properties) methods.}

However, visual texture-based approaches usually suffer from extensive site survey, a lack of generality to different sites and are prone to appearance changes, hindering their practical deployment. We propose LLM-Loc, which combines large language models (LLMs), ubiquitous scene texts and line segments for positioning, as texts and lines present more stable and robust spatial semantics. LLM-Loc comprises two stages: coarse area inference with scene texts and fine positioning with contour lines. To reduce the impact of text diversity and environmental noises on the area identification, we combine the reasoning capability of LLM and semantic priors for area inference. To reduce the impact of occlusion on contour extraction, we propose a collaborative contour refinement algorithm, where we leverage homograhy constraints and refine contour lines using images taken by others. Using the refined contour image, we propose a relative similarity ranking scheme and estimate fine user locations with orientation and map constraints. Extensive experimental results in different trial sites show LLM-Loc is accurate (mean localization errors 1.61 m and 1.34 m in the food plaza and shopping mall) and reduces positioning error at least by 39 %.}

The immense potential of AMs spans numerous industries and aspects of daily life, necessitating accelerated research efforts to meet the increasing demand. This article focuses on dielectric responsive elastomers, which are key materials within the field of AMs, highlighting advancements in theory, materials, and devices. To expedite the research and development of dielectric elastomer AM materials and beyond, we propose leveraging artificial intelligence tools to transform the artificial intelligence muscle research paradigm. Establishing an AM material database is highly valuable, as seemingly minor material data can be correlated with descriptors and target values via machine learning. Through material data mining integrating materials science and data science, we can predict potential breakthroughs in AM materials.

If group members enact social regulation strategies to cope with encountered challenges, adaptive social regulation occurs; if not, maladaptive behavior may arise. Adaptive social regulation contributes to effective collaboration, but two obstacles may hinder this process: (a) a lack of challenge awareness and (b) insufficient social regulation strategies. Research indicates that the combination of group awareness support and collaboration scripts could be a promising approach to foster adaptive social regulation. A current limitation is that previous studies have mainly focused on fostering the regulation of just a very limited set of specific challenges, neglecting the promotion of students' awareness and regulation of multiple challenges during collaborative learning. Therefore, this study proposes a combined group awareness support and collaboration scripts tool, referred to as CACS. The research was conducted in a semester-long authentic English academic writing course. Thirty-two postgraduates were randomly assigned to five groups using the CACS tool (experimental condition) and five groups without it (control condition). This study not only quantitatively validates the effectiveness of combining group awareness support with collaboration scripts in enhancing adaptive social regulation, but also qualitatively explores the underlying mechanisms through interviews. The quantitative findings demonstrate that the groups in the experimental condition showed improvements in challenge awareness, adaptive social regulation, and the overall adoption of social regulation strategies. The qualitative analysis identifies key features of group awareness support and collaboration scripts that contribute to adaptive social regulation, including increasing students’ knowledge of challenges, facilitating a shared understanding of challenging situations, and encouraging the adoption of social regulation strategies through effective reflection.}

While much attention has been given to religious radicalization, this study highlights how non-religious regimes exploit education and child socialization to consolidate power. Using a comparative, interdisciplinary framework grounded in critical theory, developmental psychology, and human rights law, it explores how states manipulate curricula, emotional bonds, and youth institutions to reengineer identity, suppress dissent, and instill loyalty. Crises enable regimes to occupy moral and epistemic space left by collapsing institutions, reframing education as a tool of ideological purification. The study introduces the concept of affective captivity to capture the emotional restructuring of children's moral frameworks and links these practices to violations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It reframes indoctrination as a form of epistemic and structural violence with enduring psychological and civic consequences. By naming secular indoctrination as a form of non-religious extremism, the article contributes to authoritarian studies, child rights, and comparative education. It calls for enhanced legal recognition, critical curriculum safeguards, and post-crisis strategies to protect children's autonomy and psychosocial development.}

Energy has become a central issue in this situation. European nations have committed to reducing their dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Meanwhile, Russia has restricted gas supplies to some countries and substantially decreased deliveries to others, and Germany found itself in the driver’s seat. This study explores the role of AI-driven energy systems and environmental policy (EPS) in shaping Germany’s response to Russian gas dependency in shifting geopolitical landscape (GPR). Using a battery of robust econometric methods, the findings reveal that AI and EPS significantly reduce Germany’s dependency on Russian gas in both the short and long run, with stronger effects observed over the long term. Geopolitical risk, although having limited direct effects, but its interaction with AI and EPS highlights the compounded benefits of integrated technological advancement and policy strategies in mitigating energy dependency in times of turmoil. Moreover, the interaction between AI, EPS, and the 2014 Crimea crisis (D2014) demonstrated that this crisis acted as a catalyst, accelerating structural changes in Germany's energy policies and diversification efforts. To test robustness, this study uses the 2014 Crimea crisis as an exogenous shock. The Synthetic Control Method (SCM) reveals a significant gap between actual and synthetic Germany’s gas imports, highlighting Germany’s efforts to address energy dependency through AI-driven energy management and policy measures. Policymakers should integrate AI technologies with targeted energy policies to enhance energy resilience and reduce dependency on geopolitical adversaries during times of crisis.}

abstract = {Background
Mental health is emerging as an increasingly prevalent public issue globally. There is an urgent need in mental health for efficient detection methods, effective treatments, affordable privacy-focused health care solutions, and increased access to specialized psychiatrists. The emergence and rapid development of large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to address these mental health demands. However, a comprehensive review summarizing the application areas, processes, and performance comparisons of LLMs in mental health has been lacking until now.
Objective
This review aimed to summarize the applications of LLMs in mental health, including trends, application areas, performance comparisons, challenges, and prospective future directions.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted to map the landscape of LLMs’ applications in mental health, including trends, application areas, comparative performance, and future trajectories. We searched 7 electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, IEEE Xplore, Weipu, CNKI, and Wanfang, from January 1, 2019, to August 31, 2024. Studies eligible for inclusion were peer-reviewed articles focused on LLMs’ applications in mental health. Studies were excluded if they (1) were not peer-reviewed or did not focus on mental health or mental disorders or (2) did not use LLMs; studies that used only natural language processing or long short-term memory models were also excluded. Relevant information on application details and performance metrics was extracted during the data charting of eligible articles.
Results
A total of 95 articles were drawn from 4859 studies using LLMs for mental health tasks. The applications were categorized into 3 key areas: screening or detection of mental disorders (67/95, 71%), supporting clinical treatments and interventions (31/95, 33%), and assisting in mental health counseling and education (11/95, 12%). Most studies used LLMs for depression detection and classification (33/95, 35%), clinical treatment support and intervention (14/95, 15%), and suicide risk prediction (12/95, 13%). Compared with nontransformer models and humans, LLMs demonstrate higher capabilities in information acquisition and analysis and efficiently generating natural language responses. Various series of LLMs also have different advantages and disadvantages in addressing mental health tasks.
Conclusions
This scoping review synthesizes the applications, processes, performance, and challenges of LLMs in the mental health field. These findings highlight the substantial potential of LLMs to augment mental health research, diagnostics, and intervention strategies, underscoring the imperative for ongoing development and ethical deliberation in clinical settings.}

Existing studies frequently constrain raw data within narrowly defined parameter spaces to enhance their statistical significance. However, such an approach may inadvertently engender overly optimistic reliability evaluations, neglecting rare yet crucial failure scenarios. Consequently, this oversight potentially underestimates systemic risks and undermines robustness. To date, the dichotomy between high data acquisition rates and the intrinsic characteristics of collected data remains inadequately addressed. Concurrently, an urgent requirement persists for developing precise data distribution models capable of comprehensively assessing wind power system reliability. In response, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are employed to bridge this research gap, enabling predictions of wind power generation through analyses of data at varying granularities. Subsequently, an Improved Latin Hypercube Sampling (ILHS) methodology is implemented to partition sampling intervals, integrating seamlessly with the Monte Carlo (MC) method for wind power data sampling. This reliability assessment model fully exploits the flexibility of the proposed sampling technique, enhancing the precision of sample probability distributions, interval segmentation, and data stratification. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior predictive accuracy and enhanced statistical efficacy relative to conventional methodologies. Thus, it offers a robust and efficacious solution for assessing the reliability of wind power integration. This study evaluates the practical reliability of a local wind power integration system in Southwest China. Additionally, methods for discerning vulnerabilities are systematically applied to fortify critical power buses and augment overall system reliability.}

However, the impact of healthcare experts' engagement on the subsequent supporters' performance within this hybrid service remains unclear. While concerns persist that experts' involvement may diminish subsequent supporters' performance due to a reduced likelihood of recognition, there is a plausible scenario in which it fosters learning and competition, thereby improving performance of subsequent supporters. Leveraging data from a Chinese online mental health platform, we utilize the mediation effects model to investigate the impact of healthcare experts' engagement on the performance of subsequent supporters. Within our model, we focus on the mediating effects of the effort and quality of answers from these subsequent supporters. Our research findings indicate that the engagement of counselors can directly enhance the social recognition obtained by subsequent supporters and can also indirectly boost this recognition by increasing the effort put into their answers. However, the quality of the subsequent supporters' answers does not play a significant mediating role in this relationship. These results fill a gap in the literature on online health services and expert effects, offering valuable insights for online health platforms aiming to enhance the performance of supporters by involving healthcare experts.}

We used relative frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), a method to measure functional lateralization of affective processing, to investigate psychobiological correlates of SFDs. With alpha activity being inversely related to cortical network activity, relative FAA refers to alpha activity on the right frontal lobe minus alpha activity on the left frontal lobe. Less relative left frontal activity, reflected by negative FAA scores, is associated with lower positive and greater negative affectivity, such as observed in depression. Due to its negative affective component (illness anxiety), we expected to find less relative left frontal activity pattern in SFDs, and positive associations with self-reported chronic stress and depression symptoms. We recorded resting-state EEG activity with 64 electrodes, placed in a 10–10 system in 26 patients with a primary SFD, 23 patients with a major depressive disorder and 25 healthy control participants. The groups did not differ in FAA. Nevertheless, across all participants, less relative left frontal activity was associated with chronic stress and depression symptoms. We concluded that FAA may not serve as an indicator of SFDs. As the relationship of FAA and depressive symptoms was fully mediated by chronic stress, future studies have to clarify whether the association between FAA and chronic stress may represent a shared underlying factor for the manifestation of mental health complaints, such as depression.}

abstract = {Steroid 5 α-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) is a key enzyme in androgen metabolism and a pharmacologic target in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although SRD5A2 is known to mediate stromal-epithelial interactions that influence prostate growth, the relationship between baseline SRD5A2 expression and prostate volume remains unclear. In this study, SRD5A2 expression was analyzed in human prostate tissues from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial and institutional biorepository cohorts. Quantitative assessments were performed and correlations were evaluated between expression level of SRD5A2, WNT5A, prostate volume, and tissue signaling profiles. SRD5A2 expression was significantly associated with total prostate and transition zone volume. Stromal-specific WNT5A expression showed a strong positive correlation with SRD5A2, whereas neither serum nor tissue dihydrotestosterone levels correlated with SRD5A2 expression. In Srd5a2-null mice, Wnt5a expression in the prostate stroma was dependent on Srd5a2 and showed region-specific regulation. Mechanistically, SRD5A2 overexpression in human prostate stromal cells up-regulated WNT5A and lymphoid enhancer–binding factor 1, activated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, increased proliferation, and reduced apoptosis. Conditioned media from these cells enhanced epithelial proliferation through paracrine IGF1 activity. This study provides the first evidence that SRD5A2 promotes prostate growth through a stromal WNT5A–lymphoid enhancer–binding factor 1–IGF1 paracrine signaling axis independent of androgen levels, suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism relevant for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia with resistance to conventional 5 α-reductase inhibitor therapy.}

abstract = {The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to surpass its predecessors by offering ubiquitous coverage of sensing, communication, and computing by the deployment of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). In SAGINs, aerial facilities, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), collect multi-modal sensory data to support diverse applications including surveillance and battlefield monitoring. However, these processing of the multi-domain inference tasks require large artificial intelligence (AI) models, demanding powerful computing capabilities and finely tuned inference models trained on rich datasets, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To provide ubiquitous powerful computation, we propose a SAGIN model collaboration framework, where LEO satellites with ubiquitous service coverage and ground servers with powerful computing capabilities work as edge nodes and cloud nodes, respectively, for the processing of sensory data from the UAVs. With limited communication bandwidth and computing capacity, the proposed framework faces the challenge of computing allocation among the edge nodes and the cloud nodes, together with the uplink-downlink resource allocation for the sensory data and model transmissions. To tackle this, we present joint edge-cloud task allocation, air-space-ground communication resource allocation, and sensory data quantization design to maximize the inference accuracy of the SAGIN model collaboration framework. The mixed integer programming problem is decomposed into two subproblems, and solved based on the propositions summarized from experimental studies. Simulations based on results from vision-based classification experiments consistently demonstrate that the inference accuracy of the SAGIN model collaboration framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths and data sizes.}

With continuous improvements in the high-speed railway network, the focus is gradually shifting from large-scale construction to large-scale operations. However, several challenges have emerged within the high-speed railway dispatching and command system, including the heavy workload faced by dispatchers, the difficulty of quantifying subjective expertise, and the need for effective training of professionals. Amid the growing application of artificial intelligence technologies in railway systems, this study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) technology. LLMs bring enhanced intelligence, predictive capabilities, robust memory, and adaptability to diverse real-world scenarios. This study proposes a human-computer interactive intelligent scheduling auxiliary training system built on LLM technology. The system offers capabilities including natural dialogue, knowledge reasoning, and human feedback learning. With broad applicability, the system is suitable for vocational education, guided inquiry, knowledge-based Q&A, and other training scenarios.

abstract = {Background
More people who smoke and are living with HIV now die from tobacco-related diseases than HIV itself. Most people are ambivalent about quitting smoking and want to quit someday but not yet. Scalable, effective interventions are needed to motivate and support smoking cessation among people ambivalent about quitting smoking (PAQS) who are living with HIV.
Objective
This study aims to develop an app-based intervention for PAQS who are living with HIV and assess its feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact. Results of this study will inform plans for future research and development.
Methods
In phase 1, PAQS living with HIV (n=8) participated in user-centered design interviews to inform the final intervention app design and recruitment plan for a subsequent randomized pilot study. In phase 2, PAQS living with HIV were randomized to either a standard care control app or a similar experimental app with additional content tailored for PAQS and those with HIV. Participants were followed for 3 months. Feasibility focused on recruitment, retention, and participants’ willingness to install the app. The study was not powered for statistical significance. Indices of acceptability (satisfaction and use) and impact (smoking behavior change and treatment uptake) were assessed via automated data and self-report among those who installed and used the app (n=19).
Results
Recruitment for both study phases was a challenge, particularly via web-based and social media platforms. Enrollment success was greater among people living with HIV recruited from a health care provider and research registry. Once enrolled, retention for the phase 2 randomized study was good; 74% (14/19) of the participants completed the 3-month follow-up. Phase 1 findings suggested that PAQS living with HIV were receptive to using an app-based intervention to help them decide whether, when, and how to stop smoking, despite not being ready to quit smoking. Phase 2 findings further supported this conclusion based on feedback from people who agreed to use an app, but group differences were observed. Indices of acceptability favored the experimental arm, including a descriptively higher mean number of sessions and utilization badges. Similarly, indices of potential impact were descriptively higher in the experimental arm (proportion reducing smoking, making a quit attempt, or calling free tobacco quitline). No participants in either arm quit smoking at the 3-month follow-up.
Conclusions
On the basis of this formative work, PAQS living with HIV may be receptive to using a mobile health–based app intervention to help them decide whether, when, or how to stop using tobacco. Indices of acceptability and impact indicate that additional research and development are warranted.

The biosynthesis of flavonoids is regulated by various transcription factors (TFs), with MYB TFs playing a key role in controlling essential genes within this pathway. In this study, we identified candidate MYB TFs from our pulp transcriptome database of durian ‘Monthong’ cultivar. MYBs exhibiting upregulation during the ripe stage were considered transcriptional activators, due to their positive correlation with flavonoid gene expression and flavonoid accumulation in ripe durian pulps. One candidate MYB activator, DzMYB1, which was highly expressed at the ripe stage, was selected for functional characterization. Studies involving transient expression of DzMYB1 in Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom fruit demonstrated increased flavonoid content, as analyzed by LC–MS/MS, compared with the GFP control. Moreover, we showed that DzMYB1 controls flavonoid biosynthesis by interacting with the promoters of various flavonoid biosynthetic genes, including chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase, resulting in their transcriptional activation. Additionally, we found that DzMYB1 functions as a homodimer and binds to a homodimerized DzbHLH1 in the intricate regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the functional roles of MYB protein in the regulation of the flavonoid pathway within durian pulps.}

While conventional ways of detecting fake news can be quite successful, they frequently fall behind the latest tactics. The developments in machine learning and deep learning algorithms have greatly enhanced the performance of fake news-detecting frameworks. This work develops a reliable and understandable method to identify fake news efficiently by combining XAI with ensemble learning and employing different techniques to increase efficacy. Nevertheless, user dependability is hampered by these products’ opaque and black-box design. Explainable AI has surfaced in subsequent actions to improve people’s comprehension of artificial intelligence conclusions. We utilized four classifiers to perform testing and training: decision tree, support vector machine, and logistic regression, respectively. Three different fake news datasets were balanced and combined to lessen overfitting. Compared to individual classifiers, the Random Forest (RF)-based stacking ensemble approach yielded the greatest results, with 98% recall, 96% accuracy, and 96% F1-score. Using XAI’s interpretability, the approach explains its categorization facts, revealing unseen techniques for recognizing fake news.}

This study explores how voice type and contribution quality influence human–agent team performance and perceptions of anthropomorphism, animacy, intelligence, and trustworthiness. By manipulating both, we reveal mechanisms of perception and clarify ambiguity in previous work. Our results show that the human resemblance of a voice assistant’s voice negatively interacts with the helpfulness of an agent’s contribution to flip its effect on perceived anthropomorphism and perceived animacy. This means human teammates interpret the agent’s contributions differently depending on its voice. Our study found no significant effect of voice on perceived intelligence, trustworthiness, or team performance. We find differences in these measures are caused by manipulating the helpfulness of an agent. These findings suggest that function matters more than form when designing agents for high-performing human–agent teams, but controlling perceptions of anthropomorphism and animacy can be unpredictable even with high human resemblance.}

In this paper, we propose a solution integrating blockchain technology, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Large Language Models (LLMs) within a metaverse environment to enhance MDT functionality. Blockchain and NFTs ensure secure ownership and access control, while the metaverse offers an engaging platform for user interaction. An LLM-powered non-player character (NPC) enables intelligent real-time user interactions and personalized insights. We develop two blockchain smart contracts for user registration, NFT ownership, and access control, and utilize decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage for the metaverse, MDT metadata, and interaction logs. We present the system architecture, sequence diagrams, and algorithms, along with the implementation and testing details. We conduct cost, security, and response time analyses to evaluate the smart contracts and LLM performance and compare our solution with existing approaches. We discuss practical implications, as well as challenges and limitations of the proposed solution. Finally, we explore the generalization of our system for various applications. The smart contract code and metaverse files are publicly available on GitHub.}

However, in these studies, corpus cleaning is often described as an optional step in the process of corpus creation and is frequently presented as a tedious, unnecessary, and time-consuming task, with the majority of scholars calling for the creation of “quick and dirty” corpora. In this paper, we re-examine corpus creation, namely corpus cleaning and metadata construction, for discipline-specific writing. More specifically, our paper seeks to reframe corpus cleaning and metadata construction as meaningful and purposeful activities that increase learners’ awareness of disciplinary norms and conventions, particularly in a comparative context. We base our analysis on the reflections provided by learners from various disciplines who designed, compiled, cleaned, and analyzed corpora, along with the final papers they drafted for the courses they took in the Department of English at a teaching-focused research university in the Middle East. Corpus cleaning and metadata creation, as we hope to show, not only make visible the invisible writing conventions within disciplines, including the integration of evidence and raw data, but also position language learners as data engineers, promoting their critical awareness of the role and nature of (language) data in the age of Large Language Models (LLMs).}

Despite being available for over two decades, the acceptance of Smart Home Technology (SHT) remains slower than anticipated, with technophobia acting as a significant barrier. This study integrates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to investigate how psychological and cultural factors influence SHT acceptance. A mediation analysis involving English (N = 284) and Spanish (N = 230) participants assessed whether technophobia, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness mediate the relationship between the frustration of psychological needs and behavioural intention. The findings suggest indirect effects through technophobia and usability factors, with Spanish participants reporting greater frustration yet a higher intention to adopt. These results underscore the need for culturally tailored interventions, such as localised education and improved usability, to enhance confidence and support broader SHT adoption.}

The unethical alienation of original knowledge producers from their intellectual products, which are repackaged by LLMs as artificial intelligence, conceals power asymmetries in the global knowledge production and dissemination system. As elaborated by Miranda Fricker (2010), Western White male actors traditionally dominate knowledge production; therefore, ChatGPT and other LLMs are inclined to reproduce patriarchal perspectives as universal understandings of the World. Our commentary applies this logic to accounting practice and research in Africa, and asserts that epistemic injustice, resulting from colonization and racism, means that ontological and epistemological approaches situated in the accounting needs and experiences of African communities are missing from or poorly articulated by ChatGPT and other LLMs. If LLMs are to attain legitimacy as (ethical) sources of knowledge, regulation must be enforced to ensure transparency—as a foundation for promoting pluriversality and eliminating epistemic injustice.}

Specifically, an interpretable principal component analysis (iPCA) combined with machine learning is utilized to forecast CVSS scores using text descriptions from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Different forecasting approaches, including traditional machine learning models, Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and Transformer architectures (ChatGPT) are compared to determine the best performance. The results show that iPCA combined with support vector regression achieves a high performance (R2 = 98%) in predicting CVSS scores using CVE text descriptions. The results indicate that the variability, length, and details in the vulnerability description contribute to the performance of the transformer model. These findings are consistent across vulnerability descriptions from six companies between 2017 and 2019.

KGs excel at structured knowledge representation and reasoning, offering interpretability; however, they are costly to construct, have limited coverage, and lack natural language processing capabilities. Conversely, LLMs possess powerful language understanding and generation abilities, but they rely heavily on vast amounts of data, are prone to “hallucinations," and lack interpretability. The integration of these two approaches is an inevitable trend for achieving stronger and more reliable AI applications, and has become a hot topic of research. Simultaneously, the combination of LLMs and KGs perfectly aligns with the pressing needs of the education field for precise reasoning and personalized services, addressing the shortcomings of traditional teaching methods and providing support for intelligent education. In light of this, this paper undertakes work in the following three key areas. Firstly, the concepts and technologies of both LLMs and KGs, along with their applications in education, are introduced. On this basis, the paper then delves into a discussion of the methods for integrating LLMs and KGs, and reviews related research progress. Finally, the paper focuses on specific educational scenarios, such as intelligent tutoring systems, intelligent learning companions, and intelligent evaluation systems, to explore the collaborative application of LLMs and KGs. The aim of this paper is to provide researchers in the field with a systematic understanding of LLMs and KGs, and to offer valuable references for future AI-driven educational innovation.}

abstract = {The impact of acupuncture on knee function and pain intensity following knee replacement remains controversial. Therefore, we categorized the postsurgery recovery period into 3 phases: short-term (≤2 weeks), intermediate-term (2 weeks–3 months), and long-term (>3 months), and then assessed the effectiveness of acupuncture in improving function and alleviating pain at different stages following knee replacement. This meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials that compared acupuncture intervention with either no treatment or a sham group after knee replacement. Six databases were searched from inception to December 31, 2023, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and 2 Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang Data). A total of 23 studies comprising 1,464 participants were included. Significant improvement of active range of motion was observed on day 7 and week 2 after operation. Lower pain intensity at rest was noted in patients receiving acupuncture in short-term periods after operation (12 hours, day 1, day 2, day 5, and week 2). A reduction in pain intensity during movement with acupuncture was observed on postoperative day 1 and day 7. Auricular acupuncture did not show not significant effectiveness in improving range of motion and pain intensity. For conventional acupuncture, the combination of distal and local point selection was found to be the most effective. Early application of acupuncture, in conjunction with physical therapy, starting before postoperative day 1 or day 2, was recommended. Further high-quality researches are warranted to validate the findings in this meta-analysis.
Perspective
This article demonstrates that acupuncture has short-term effects (≤2 weeks) on improving active range of motion and reducing pain during rest and during movement following knee replacement surgery. The findings support the early application of acupuncture in hospital settings after knee replacement.

abstract = {While “big data” approaches to writing center research represent promising angles from which to understand the intellectual labor happening during tutorials, aggregation strips away the context in which writing center texts and data are originally constructed. In fact, new methods such as the large-scale corpus analysis of writing center session notes highlight the need for more critical analyses of the administrative software used to generate, archive, and distribute these texts. Drawing on Bogost's (2007) conception of procedural rhetoric and Manovich's (2013) understanding of softwarization, this article seeks to address this gap by recontextualizing writing center session notes within the layered arguments constructed by TutorTrac, a scheduling platform used by many centers. I argue this software advances a rhetoric of recordkeeping that, left unrecognized, risks shifting center practices away from stated commitments and values. In demonstrating how writing center practitioners can employ an understanding of procedural rhetoric to interrogate such applications, this study suggests more attention be dedicated to critical readings of software in writing centers.}

After de-oiling, the macauba pulp meal (MPM) offers a dietary fiber content of 40–50 %, which mainly comprises cell wall polysaccharides (CWP). The present work aimed to assess the potential of MPM as an innovative source of sustainable food polysaccharides. To this end, the macauba CWP were fractionated into water-soluble galactoglucomannans (21.7 %), calcium- and ester-bound pectins (3.4 %), loosely-bound xyloglucans (27.6 %), strongly-bound xylans (6.5 %), and a cellulose-rich fraction (39.3 %). The galactoglucomannans produced shear-thinning aqueous dispersions with an increase in consistency index from 3.03·10−2 to 3.58·101 Pa·sn by increasing the concentration from 1.0 to 5.0 %. The galactoglucomannans dispersions showed semi-dilute behavior, evidenced by relaxation times ranging from 1.24·10−2 to 1.17 s for concentrations from 2.5 to 10.0 %. Macauba pectins and xyloglucans showed weak gel behavior, with an increase in yield stress from 3.20·10−1 to 1.04·102 Pa and from 7.01·10−2 to 1.35·102 Pa for dispersions at 2.5 to 10.0 %, respectively. 2.5 to 5 times higher concentration of macauba polysaccharides is needed to obtain rheological behavior similar to guar and xanthan gum. The thickening and gelling properties of macauba CWP highlight their potential as thickeners and stabilizers for the food industry.}

An analysis was conducted of three international graduate students’ writing practices as they completed two argumentative writing assessment tasks. On one task, participants could access external writing resources (e.g., the internet) and had additional time to complete the task; on the other, access to writing resources was not permitted and a more restricted time limit was enforced. Data were collected from digital screen capture recordings of participants’ compositional practices and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results indicated that participants took more time and wrote at a slower pace when they had access to external resources; however, additional time did not necessarily lead to a greater volume of writing. Participants also tended to shuttle between writing processes more frequently and execute more micro-level writing actions when they had access to external resources. However, there was substantial individual variation for both fluency and writing processes, highlighting the mediating role of individual differences in L2 writing. Implications for how the construct of academic writing ability is defined in different assessment contexts are discussed.}

This paper selects CHARLS 2018 data, uses the Probit model, and constructs a theoretical framework with Fogg's Behavior Model to demonstrate the effects of care for the aged. The results showed that older persons with family care in rural areas were more likely to use traditional cooking energy. The disincentive is reinforced by the utilization of traditional cooking energy by neighbors in the community. And those with personal care were more likely to use clean cooking energy. The ability to guarantee clean cooking energy being adopted reinforces the facilitating effect of personal care. In order to promote and use clean energy, it is vital to understand the unique influence of different kinds of care for the aged. Efforts in policy and practice should focus on boosting the motivation and ability to adopt clean energy. The main contributions are: (1) The paper included different kinds of care for the aged as an influencing factor in using clean cooking energy; (2) Through its analysis of motivation and ability factors influencing behavioral choices, it exhaustively explores the inherent mechanisms; (3) This paper can bring policy implications for the promotion of clean cooking energy in rural areas of developing countries.}

This research aimed to investigate the impact of a sourcing organizer on sixth graders' online multimodal and multiple document reading (MMDR) abilities, focusing on aspects such as source-content link and text integration in relation to reading on the Internet. Cognitive and affective factors associated with MMDR were examined. The study involved 52 sixth-graders (55.77% males) from two typical elementary school classes in the northern region of Taiwan. Two intact classes were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group with the quasi-experimental design. The experimental group (n = 26) received a pre-outlined sourcing organizer, guiding them to record the article title, author, publication date, website name, and major assertions from six assigned multimodal texts. In contrast, the control group (n = 26) received a regular organizer, prompting them to summarize the main ideas from the same six assigned multimodal texts. The study's findings indicated that employing sourcing organizers positively impacted students' performance in text integration. However, it was observed that both groups, regardless of whether they used regular organizers or sourcing organizers, experienced benefits in terms of source-content links. Furthermore, reading ability emerged as the sole significant predictor for source-content links, whereas both reading ability and the use of sourcing organizers predicted text integration. The implications of these findings were discussed to provide insights into instructional strategies to develop online MMDR competencies in elementary students.}

While different modelling approaches have been proposed to quantify the environmental impacts of the EU building stock, limited knowledge is available on the sensitivity of these models to key parameters associated with circular economy measures. To fill this gap, this study aims at testing lifespan and end-of-life modelling choices to gain an improved understanding of their effect on the quantification of the environmental impacts of the EU residential sector, using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based building stock model developed by the European Commission – Joint Research Centre (JRC) as the reference model. Several options were explored in relation to parameters affecting the service lives of buildings and their components, along with their end-of-life pathways. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to evaluate the model's robustness when subjected to parameter changes derived from the literature. It emerged that, due to the prominent role played by the operational energy phase, environmental impact results at the stock level were not significantly affected by parameter changes, with the exception of the particulate matter impact category, which achieved >10% variations when simultaneously testing shorter finishing material service lives and lower incineration and recycling rates. Shifting the focus to embodied impacts, however, led to increased sensitivity in the model, with oscillations due to service life length overshadowing those connected to end-of-life treatment changes: in terms of single weighted score, the former can achieve a building-level variation of over 100% (when assuming short lifespans), while the latter does not exceed 38% (when maximising incineration rates). It is therefore necessary to take these fluctuations into account when using this LCA-based model as a basis for verifying the potential benefits of measures to promote circularity within the building sector, particularly as said measures primarily target embodied impacts.}

However, it is unknown whether different levels of AI are perceived by customers as features increasing humanness and, subsequently, leading to higher functional, monetary, social, or emotional value. Through an experimental design based on tourism chatbots, the results from structural equation analysis reveal that whereas mechanical AI decreases automated social presence, analytical AI increases perceptions of competence and warmth, and emotional AI improves all humanness cues. The article merges the research streams of service agent design and customers’ perceptions of humanness to guide tourism managers in implementing generative AI agents to increase service value.}

Pracademics, who actively participate in both research and practice activities, cross boundaries between domains, so play a critical role in bringing theories into practice. However, the role of pracademics is conceptually underdeveloped and ambiguous, limiting our understanding of how actors engage in bridging the research-practice divide. We propose a continuum of research-practice roles, recognizing that hybrid roles are often fluid in nature. We explain how hybrid professionals hold different identities; as impact-driven scholars, reflective practitioners, or pracademics. These roles have implications for individuals' activities, identity work, career, and collaboration. Drawing on three contemporary challenges in HRM, we illustrate how hybrid professionals can align HRM theory and practice and help close the research-practice gap. As well as theoretical and managerial implications, we also highlight implications of the continuum of roles for policy makers and funders.}

However, traditional peer review faces numerous challenges, including reviewer bias, limited expertise, and an overwhelming volume of publications. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest their potential as promising evaluators, capable of approximating human cognition and understanding both ordinary and scientific language. In this study, we propose a novel AI-empowered paper evaluation method, PaperEval (PE), which utilizes a multi-agent system powered by LLMs to design evaluation criteria, assess paper quality along different dimensions, and generate explainable scores. We also introduce two variants of PE, Multi-round PaperEval (MPE) and Self-correcting PaperEval (SPE), which produce comparable scores and iteratively refine the evaluation criteria, respectively. To test our methods, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of three curated datasets, encompassing about 66,000 target papers of varying quality across the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and medicine. The results show that our methods can effectively discern between high- and low-quality papers based on scores derived in four dimensions: Question, Method, Result, and Conclusion. Moreover, the results highlight the evaluation’s stability over time, the impact of comparative papers, the advantages of the multi-round evaluation strategy, and the varying correlation between AI ratings and scientific impact across different disciplines. Our method can seamlessly integrate into the existing scientific evaluation system, offering valuable insights for the development of AI-driven scientific evaluation.}

As a first step to empirically test its model assumptions, we investigated potential associations between chronic stress, physiological stress axis activity and medically-unexplained in a cross-sectional study. One hundred-ninety-nine healthy individuals provided self-reports on chronic stress and medically-unexplained symptoms, resting heart rate/variability (HR/HRV; e.g., root mean square of successive differences/RMSSD, low frequency/LF power), cortisol awakening response (CAR) and diurnal cortisol. Significant positive contributors to medically-unexplained symptoms were the chronic stress scales ‘lack of social appreciation’ and ‘chronic worries’, as well as CAR and LF HRV; diurnal cortisol was a negative contributor. Mediation analyses showed that the impact of neural indicators associated with physiological stress axis activity (HR/HRV) related to medically-unexplained symptoms, which was mediated by chronic stress, whereas the mediation effect as suggested by the positive feedback model was not significant. These cross-sectional findings do not support the positive feedback model. Longitudinal studies are required to conclude about potential mechanistic and causal relationships in the model. Nevertheless, our mediation analyses give first indication that the constitution of physiological stress axes may play a major role in how stressors are perceived and which kind of health-consequences (e.g., medically-unexplained symptoms) this may have.}

Hence, there is a critical need for physiologically relevant human skin models to explore novel treatment strategies. Recent advances in microfluidic technologies now allow design and generation of organ-on-chip devices that mimic critical features of tissue architecture. Skin-on-a-chip and microfluidic platforms hold promise as useful models for diverse dermatology applications. Compared with traditional in vitro models, microfluidic platforms offer improved control of fluid flow, which in turn allows precise manipulation of cell and molecular distribution. These properties enable the generation of multilayered in vitro models that mimic human skin structure while simultaneously offering superior control over nutrient and drug distribution. Researchers have used microfluidic platforms for a variety of applications in skin research, including epidermal–dermal cellular crosstalk, cell migration, mechanobiology, microbiome–immune response interactions, vascular biology, and wound healing. In this review, we comprehensively review state-of-the-art microfluidic models for skin research. We discuss the challenges and promise of current skin-on-a-chip technologies and provide a roadmap for future research in this active field.}

Participants responded to liking, emotions, and perceived sensory attributes of five blends of smoke-impacted wine with non-impacted wine, along with a smoke-impacted wine presented with four different label concepts. Two clusters of consumers were identified, with one disliking the smoke-impacted wine (smoke-dislikers) and the other cluster liking (smoke-liker). The smoke-liker cluster indicated a greater liking of smoke flavours in foods and beverages, along with a higher level of subjective wine knowledge. For the labels, the introduction of the label concept significantly increased liking of the wine for the smoke-dislikers, as well as had the power to elicit different emotions and sensory experiences. This research provides vital information to the wine industry as they adapt to future wildfire years, along with how the distinct sensory profile may not be detrimental to consumer acceptance and can be modulated by the type of information on label. Further research is needed to explore how different populations and wine styles correlate with these findings, and the effects of varying levels of smoke exposure in Pinot noir and other grape varietals.}

However, there is limited understanding of how mindset framing shapes users’ moral judgments and emotional responses toward these technologies. To address this gap, this research examines how framing GenAI, particularly in terms of growth or fixed mindset, influences moral appraisals, emotional reactions, and privacy behaviors. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research combines text mining of a large field dataset (n = 18,035 reviews) with two experimental studies (n = 255 participants). Findings reveal that mindset framing directly influences perceived morality, suggesting that GenAI framed in a growth mindset evokes more positive moral judgments compared to a fixed mindset framing. A growth mindset suggests learning and adaptability, whereas a fixed mindset framing implies that it is immutable and incapable of improvement. Perceived moral judgments mediate the effect of mindset framing (growth vs. fixed) on emotional appraisals. Moreover, mindset framing influences privacy behavior, with participants having low (vs. high) expertise disclosing more under a growth (vs. fixed) mindset. Theoretically, this paper contributes to the literature by integrating key theories on moral judgment, implicit theories, cognitive appraisal theory, and privacy calculus theory, thereby deepening the understanding of moral appraisals regarding GenAI. In practical terms, this research enables organizations to strategically frame GenAI capabilities, positively influencing users' privacy behavior and emotional responses.}

abstract = {Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for modeling complex physical problems. However, they suffer from spectral bias making them oblivious to high-frequency modes, which are present in multiscale physical systems. Therefore, they tend to produce over-smoothed solutions, which is particularly problematic in modeling turbulence and for systems with intricate patterns and sharp gradients such as multi-phase flow systems. In this work, we introduce a new approach named high-frequency scaling (HFS) to mitigate spectral bias in convolutional-based neural operators. By integrating HFS with proper variants of UNet, we demonstrate a higher prediction accuracy by mitigating spectral bias in single and two-phase flow problems. Unlike Fourier-based techniques, HFS is directly applied to the latent space, thus eliminating the computational cost associated with the Fourier transform. Additionally, we investigate alternative spectral bias mitigation through a diffusion model conditioned on neural operators. While the diffusion model integrated with the standard neural operator may still suffer from significant errors, these errors are substantially reduced when the diffusion model is integrated with a HFS-enhanced neural operator.}

abstract = {With the rapid expansion of e-commerce and the resulting surge in parcel delivery demands, the integration of trucks and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in last-mile package delivery provides a more efficient and sustainable venue for a logistics system. However, coordinating trucks and UGVs in the context of fluctuating traffic conditions, especially with varying travel times, continues to be a significant challenge. This study addresses this issue by proposing and solving a two-echelon truck-UGV routing problem with time-dependent travel times. The first echelon encompasses transporting goods from the warehouse to satellites using trucks, considering time-dependent travel times. The second echelon involves distributing goods from satellites to customers using UGVs. Initially, a continuous-time time-dependent travel model is proposed based on the fluid queueing model to estimate vehicle travel times under varying traffic conditions. We then develop a multiobjective mixed integer linear programming model that aims to minimize total operating costs and the number of UGVs used. Subsequently, a novel hybrid algorithm combining an improved three dimension k-nearest neighbor clustering algorithm with an improved multiobjective adaptive large neighborhood search method is developed to solve the model. This algorithm incorporates the adaptive score adjustment and Pareto solution selection strategies to enhance algorithm convergence and evaluate solution quality. The acceptance criterion for new solutions is redesigned based on multiobjective function values to explore the search space more thoroughly. Additionally, the algorithm’s computational performance is verified by comparing it with the CPLEX solver for small-scale problems and with multiobjective ant colony optimization, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, multiobjective particle swarm optimization, multiobjective monarch butterfly optimization, and multiobjective harmony search algorithms for medium-to-large problems. The results demonstrate the superior convergence, uniformity, and spread of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, a real-world case study employing traffic information of Dalian city, China, supports that the proposed method enhances the efficiency of delivery. Four different time-dependent travel times model are proposed to analyze the outperformance of the time-dependent travel model in this study. Finally, the sensitivity analysis considers different road congestion states and UGV capacities, aiming to reduce transportation costs, and overcome high coordination and congestion costs in the network. This study offers robust methodologies for theoretically and practically addressing the two-echelon truck-UGV routing problem with time-dependent travel times, providing essential insights for promoting development, enhancing smart city integration, and boosting operational efficiency.}

Finite element techniques for 2D axisymmetric analysis of the CBS were developed, including the modeling of V-clamp, strap pre-tension, and loads, then the optimizing constraints and objectives were also defined. Secondly, a CBS with a diameter of 3 m was designed via the proposed method, which is verified by the 3D finite element analysis under MSC.Marc and a stiffness experiment. Thirdly, the separation process of the CBS and its high-frequency and high-amplitude shock response were calculated by an explicit dynamic solver, and the differences between the model and experimental results were discussed.

keywords = {Medical image segmentation, Lightweight neural network, Attention mechanism, Multi-scale feature fusion},
abstract = {Background and objectives:
Current state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods prioritize precision but often at the expense of increased computational demands and larger model sizes. Applying these large-scale models to the relatively limited scale of medical image datasets tends to induce redundant computation, complicating the process without the necessary benefits. These approaches increase complexity and pose challenges for integrating and deploying lightweight models on edge devices. For instance, recent transformer-based models have excelled in 2D and 3D medical image segmentation due to their extensive receptive fields and high parameter count. However, their effectiveness comes with the risk of overfitting when applied to small datasets. It often neglects the vital inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), essential for local feature representation.
Methods:
In this work, we propose PMFSNet, a novel medical imaging segmentation model that effectively balances global and local feature processing while avoiding the computational redundancy typical of larger models. PMFSNet streamlines the UNet-based hierarchical structure and simplifies the self-attention mechanism’s computational complexity, making it suitable for lightweight applications. It incorporates a plug-and-play PMFS block, a multi-scale feature enhancement module based on attention mechanisms, to capture long-term dependencies.
Results:
The extensive comprehensive results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in various segmentation tasks on different data scales even with fewer than a million parameters. Results reveal that our PMFSNet achieves IoU of 84.68%, 82.02%, 78.82%, and 76.48% on public datasets of 3D CBCT Tooth, ovarian tumors ultrasound (MMOTU), skin lesions dermoscopy (ISIC 2018), and gastrointestinal polyp (Kvasir SEG), and yields DSC of 78.29%, 77.45%, and 78.04% on three retinal vessel segmentation datasets, DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1, respectively.
Conclusion:
Our proposed model exhibits competitive performance across various datasets, accomplishing this with significantly fewer model parameters and inference time, demonstrating its value in model integration and deployment. It strikes an optimal compromise between efficiency and performance and can be a highly efficient solution for medical image analysis in resource-constrained clinical environments.

Background
Multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) staining, such as CODEX and MIBI, holds significant clinical value for various fields, such as disease diagnosis, biological research, and drug development. However, these techniques are often hindered by high time and cost requirements.
Methods
Here we present a Multimodal-Attention-based virtual mIF Staining (MAS) system that utilises a deep learning model to extract potential antibody-related features from dual-modal non-antibody-stained fluorescence imaging, specifically autofluorescence (AF) and DAPI imaging. The MAS system simultaneously generates predictions of mIF with multiple survival-associated biomarkers in gastric cancer using self- and multi-attention learning mechanisms.
Findings
Experimental results with 180 pathological slides from 94 patients with gastric cancer demonstrate the efficiency and consistent performance of the MAS system in both cancer and noncancer gastric tissues. Furthermore, we showcase the prognostic accuracy of the virtual mIF images of seven gastric cancer related biomarkers, including CD3, CD20, FOXP3, PD1, CD8, CD163, and PD-L1, which is comparable to those obtained from the standard mIF staining.
Interpretation
The MAS system rapidly generates reliable multiplexed staining, greatly reducing the cost of mIF and improving clinical workflow.

The overall 5-year survival rate remains low, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapies. Despite the promising efficacy of immunotherapy for various solid tumors, its benefits for pancreatic cancer have been disappointing. This is largely because of the complex and unique mechanisms of immune evasion inherent in PDAC. Emerging evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating the immune escape of PDAC. TAMs significantly contribute to forming an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which hinders the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic approaches. They achieve this through multiple pathways, including the secretion of cytokines and the promotion or inhibition of multiple immune cells. In this review, we summarized the main pathways through which TAMs form an immunosuppressive microenvironment in PDAC. We also examined the current status and recent progress of immunotherapy strategies that specifically target macrophages. By understanding these mechanisms and exploring targeted therapies, we aimed to shed light on potential avenues for improving the treatment outcomes of this devastating disease.}

Absorption refrigeration systems driven by low-temperature waste heat is one way to achieve “carbon neutrality.” Meanwhile, the keto-benzene dewaxing equipment needs a cooling capacity of 5 MW, with refrigeration temperature of −10 °C and −25 °C. This paper researches the feasibility of dual-stage evaporation-ammonia hybrid compression–absorption refrigeration system (DSE-AHCARS) replacing the vapor compression refrigeration system for keto-benzene dewaxing process based on energy, exergy, economic, and environmental (4E) analysis. At the primary- and secondary-stage evaporation temperature of 0 and –23 °C, respectively, the coefficient of performance (COP) reaches the maximum value of 0.85; however, COP-electricity reaches the minimum value of 8.1. When the secondary-stage refrigeration temperature is −23 °C, CO2 emission increases from 1150 t·a−1 to 3600 t·a−1, and life cycle climate performance increases from 3.29 × 104 to 7.7 × 104 t, with the primary-stage refrigeration temperature being −15–0 °C, as well as matching three parameters to ensure the 4E compromising performance by the multi-objective optimization. To guarantee that the life cycle climate performance is less than 5.5 × 104 t, the payback period is <2 a, and COP is >0.6 at the optimal operation ranges, such that the refrigeration temperature difference between primary stage and secondary stage is within 20 °C. The power of DSE-AHCARS was reduced by 77% compared with the vapor-compression refrigeration system. Therefore, the DSE-AHCARS can reduce CO2 emissions by about 6250 t·a−1 and save 1.2 × 105 t of CO2 in the life cycle climate performance term. This result shows that the DSE-AHCARS can completely replace the vapor-compression refrigeration system.}

The co-design process involved a series of workshops with clinicians followed by in-depth interviews with healthcare leaders to derive input regarding feasibility and implementation. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. There was a great deal of interest in compassion interventions from healthcare professionals and leaders. However, for compassion interventions to be acceptable, feasible, and effective, compassion interventions design should be reimagined and reflected at each step of interventional design and implementation and span across organizational levels. Namely, the results of the study showed the preference for non-individual focused multi-level interventions to build bridges and connections. The desired compassion intervention components included practising connecting with others' humanity, improving compassion knowledge and relational and reflective skills, and cultural safety and anti-racism training. Experiential training embedded in models of cultural dialogue was the preferred interventional modality. Prioritising leadership as an intervention site was suggested to improve leadership's buy-in of compassion interventions and possibly serve as a starting point for transforming the broader culture, reviving interconnectedness in a healthcare system described as fragmented, disconnected, and alienating with compassion also acting as an equalizer of power.}

This study addresses this issue through a joint application of graph signal processing theory and the spectral clustering algorithm. Two WDNs are modeled as graphs, and the spectral clustering algorithm is used to identify leak-sensitive regions based on the properties of the vertices. Then, three metrics from signal sampling on graphs are employed to select the vertices as possible locations for installing the sensors. A new metric, which considers the coverage rate of installed sensors, is introduced to evaluate the performance of the pressure monitoring system, in addition to helping to determine the optimal number of sensors to be deployed. The proposed approach demonstrates an increase of up to 20% in the coverage rate compared to existing methods. Detailed leak simulations show coverage rates of 84% for the Modena network and 92% for the L-Town network with optimal sensor placement. This methodology provides a more efficient and cost-effective solution for WDN managers.}

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex, heterogeneous disease characterized by frequent relapses and metastasis. Previous studies have reported that the invasion and progression of CRC in several cases can be controlled by targeting fusion genes. This study aimed to screen for potent fusion transcripts as potential molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for metastatic CRC (mCRC) using an in silico approach.
Methods
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 18 patients with primary CRC and matched normal and mCRC samples were derived from the same patient set. Novel fusion transcripts were screened using the Kallisto and Pizzly software, followed by Gene Ontology (GO), pathway analysis, transcription factor enrichment, and survival for functional enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the fusion transcripts’ utility as biomarkers was evaluated using a pan-cancer analysis.
Results
In total, 32 fusion genes unique to mCRC were identified. Hub gene analysis identified 17 novel fusion transcripts, and GO analysis revealed that these genes were enriched in different biological and molecular functions. Pathways significantly correlated with CRC included the complement and coagulation cascades, ferroptosis, interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway. We identified albumin-eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (ALB-EEF1A1) as unique to mCRC based on significant gene expression and survival outcomes. Moreover, its utility as a prognostic biomarker was confirmed using a pan-cancer analysis.
Conclusions
ALB-EEF1A1 may play a pivotal role in the metastatic transformation of primary CRC and significantly increase the risk of death. The identified ALB-EEF1A1 fusion transcripts are promising novel molecular targets that may serve as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets for mCRC in the future.}

This study aims to examine the relationship between various types of literacy on one hand and identification of misinformation and dissemination of such information on the other, in search for better countermeasures against misinformation.
Design/methodology/approach
Based on data from a large-scale survey, models are constructed and analyzed to assess the relationships of literacy with both the identification of inaccuracies and dissemination behavior.
Findings
Regarding the identification of misinformation, individuals with high critical thinking attitudes (subjective literacy) are less likely to recognize misinformation, while other objective literacies do not have a significant relationship. Regarding dissemination behavior, individuals with high information literacy, media literacy and critical thinking scores tend not to disseminate misinformation, whereas those with high critical thinking attitudes are more likely to disseminate such information.
Originality/value
First, it quantitatively elucidates the relationships various literacies have with the accuracy judgment and dissemination behavior of misinformation. This highlights the effectiveness of objective indicators of literacies and the need for caution regarding subjective literacy – i.e. self-confidence in their own literacy. Second, it provides a cross-disciplinary analysis of the relationships, covering not only oft-studied politics and health care but also various other fields, thereby identifying comprehensive literacy strategies against misinformation. Third, it addresses differences in dissemination methods and offers insights into more practical countermeasures.}

Objective
While it is widely acknowledged that fingerprint recognition has played an essential part in policing and forensic science, little is known about fingerprint alterations in medical science, specifically as a consequence of anticancer treatments. Thus, we aimed to analyze the extent of evidence between cancer treatments and fingerprint alterations in adults with cancer.
Methods
A systematic integrative review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and the Cochrane guidelines for conducting a systematic review. PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from the inception between August and November 2024. The quality appraisal was conducted to evaluate the methodological quality of the included articles, selecting the most appropriate tool based on the publication type and study design.
Results
Of 176 records, we selected five experimental studies articles and nine case reports publications. A correlation between specific anticancer treatments (capecitabine, taxanes, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and fingerprint alterations has been documented in individuals with various cancer diagnoses (mainly advanced breast and colorectal cancers). The majority of articles were of moderate to low quality.
Conclusions
Although fingerprint alteration as a consequence of specific anticancer treatments has been documented, further large and well-designed experimental studies are necessary to quantify the phenomenon burden in relation to specific anticancer regimens and populations.

abstract = {Radiology reports serve as a fundamental component within electronic medical records. Converting unstructured free-text reports into structured formats holds paramount importance for the management and utilization of radiology reports. In this paper, we propose a novel information extraction paradigm named normalized clinical information extraction (NCIE) for Chinese radiology reports. Specifically, NCIE operates in an end-to-end fashion to extract normalized and structured clinical information without decomposing the information extraction process into multiple intermediate tasks. Motivated by recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), we address the NCIE problem based on the instruction tuning of LLMs. The proposed approach, termed Radiological Information End-to-end Extraction with LLM (RIEEL), excels at extracting structural information comprising radiological observations alongside their corresponding anatomical locations and status. To ensure the model in learning the normalized medical concepts correctly, we establish a radiology knowledge base with expert knowledge and further curate a high-quality instruction tuning dataset. Moreover, we incorporate two data-efficient learning strategies based on data augmentation and self-training to enhance the model’s NCIE capabilities during instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed RIEEL achieves superior performances with different state-of-the-arts backbone LLMs, including Qwen1.5, Baichuan2 and LLaMA3. Remarkably, the best version of RIEEL surpasses GPT-4 in NCIE by a substantial margin of 30.61% in terms of the F1 score.}

abstract = {Background
Work-related stress is associated with poor job performance and negative health outcomes. Changing health behaviors through corporate wellness programs can improve physical and mental health and help employees manage stress. This project sought to pilot the potential addition of brief coaching and biofeedback to an 8-week web-based self-help program to improve employee stress using the multiphase optimization strategy.
Objective
This study aims to determine which candidate components will be tested in a later optimization phase and at what dose they will be tested, examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the different components, investigate whether the outcomes can be feasibly measured, and review evidence to build a conceptual model before the optimization phase.
Methods
The study was positioned within the preparation phase of the multiphase optimization strategy. It is a 2×2×2×2 design with 4 components: 2 types of health coaching and 2 types of biofeedback. All components were tested by turning them on or off. A total of 16 adult office workers (mean age 40, SD 14.3 years; n=15 women) completed an 8-week self-paced web-based stress management and health behavior change program and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 16 conditions, created from a combination of the 4 candidate components. Assessments included web analytics, surveys, and interviews regarding program recommendations, likes, and dislikes.
Results
Findings from the interviews provided suggestions to improve the intervention (eg, separating wellness from stress content) and trial conduct (eg, streamlining the onboarding process). On average, participants logged into the wellness program 83 times (range 36-291), with 75% (12/16) participant retention and 67% (8/12) survey completion. There were no reported problems with coaching or obtaining data from interviews or apps. The interview findings suggested potential mediators to include and assess in a future conceptual model.
Conclusions
The results provided areas to improve the intervention content and trial methods. Instead of progressing to the next scheduled large-scale optimization phase, our plan to iterate through a second preparation phase after making changes to the protocol, apps, and corporate coaching partner.}

In this study, we aim to investigate how neonatal exposure to sex hormones affects alcohol intake and the regulation of the mesolimbic pathway in adulthood. The study aimed to investigate the impact of neonatal exposure to a single dose of testosterone propionate (TP) or estradiol valerate (EV) on ethanol consumption in adult rats. The rats were subjected to a two-bottle free-choice paradigm, and the content of dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was measured using HPLC-ED. The expression of critical DA-related proteins in the mesolimbic pathway was evaluated through RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Supraphysiological neonatal exposure to EV or TP resulted in increased ethanol intake over four weeks in adulthood. In addition, the DA and DOPAC content was reduced and increased in the NAcc of EV and TP-treated rats, and β-endorphin content in the hypothalamus decreased in EV-treated rats. The VTA μ receptor and DA type 2 form short receptor (D2S) expression were significantly reduced in EV and TP male rats. Finally, in an extended 6-week protocol, the increase in ethanol consumption induced by EV was mitigated during the initial two hours post-naloxone injection. Neonatal exposure to sex hormones is a detrimental stimulus for the brain, which can facilitate the development of addictive behaviors, including alcohol use disorder.}

This duality reflects a broader shift toward physical AI a term used to describe embodied AI systems capable of interacting with the physical world through movement and perception - of which humanoid robots are a prominent example. Our paper explores how these technologies reshape and extend established management theories across three disciplines—human resource management (HRM), marketing and consumer behavior (CB), and operations management (OM). Specifically, we propose that in HRM, humanoid robots challenge team role theory by introducing machine-oriented roles, such as trainers and testers, while AI agents prompt a rethinking of social learning theory through their capacity to enable behavior simulation and dynamic feedback loops. In marketing and CB, AI agents reconfigure value co-creation within service-dominant logic by acting as autonomous co-creators of value, while humanoid robots influence social agency theory by altering perceptions of trust and power dynamics. In OM, these technologies drive new opportunities for throughput, agility, and process optimization by integrating real-time predictive analytics and adaptive workflow automation. These insights emphasize that while many traditional theories remain relevant, they require adaptation to account for human–machine collaboration, machine agency, and the hybrid roles emerging in organizational contexts.}

Past investigations found that activation in brain areas involved in executive function and reward processing was associated with people offering less with no threat of rejection from their partner, compared to offering more when there was a threat of rejection. However, it remains unclear how trait reward sensitivity may modulate activation and connectivity patterns in these situations. To address this gap, we used task-based fMRI to examine the relation between reward sensitivity and the neural correlates of bargaining choices. Participants (N = 54) completed the Sensitivity to Punishment (SP)/Sensitivity to Reward (SR) Questionnaire and the Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System scales. Participants performed the Ultimatum and Dictator Games as proposers and exhibited strategic decisions by being fair when there was a threat of rejection, but being selfish when there was not a threat of rejection. We found that strategic decisions evoked activation in the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) and the Anterior Insula (AI). Next, we found elevated IFG connectivity with the Temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during strategic decisions. Finally, we explored whether trait reward sensitivity modulated brain responses while making strategic decisions. We found that people who scored lower in reward sensitivity made less strategic choices when they exhibited higher AI-Angular Gyrus connectivity. Taken together, our results demonstrate how trait reward sensitivity modulates neural responses to strategic decisions, potentially underscoring the importance of this factor within social and decision neuroscience.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly embedded in medical education, providing benefits in instructional design, content creation, and administrative efficiency. Tools like ChatGPT are reshaping training and teaching practices in digital health. However, concerns about faculty overreliance highlight risks to pedagogical autonomy, cognitive engagement, and ethics. Despite global interest, there is limited empirical research on AI dependency among medical educators, particularly in underrepresented regions like the Global South.
Objective
This study focused on Palestine and aimed to (1) identify factors contributing to AI dependency among medical educators, (2) assess its impact on teaching autonomy, decision-making, and professional identity, and (3) propose strategies for sustainable and responsible AI integration in digital medical education.
Methods
A qualitative research design was used, using semistructured interviews (n=22) and focus group discussions (n=24) involving 46 medical educators from nursing, pharmacy, medicine, optometry, and dental sciences. Thematic analysis, supported by NVivo (QSR International), was conducted on 15.5 hours of transcribed data. Participants varied in their frequency of AI use: 45.7% (21/46) used AI daily, 30.4% (14/46) weekly, and 15.2% (7/46) monthly.
Results
In total, 5 major themes were identified as drivers of AI dependency: institutional workload (reported by >80% [37/46] of participants), low academic confidence (noted by 28/46, 60%), and perfectionism-related stress (23/46, 50%). The following 6 broad consequences of AI overreliance were identified: Skills Atrophy (reported by 89% [41/46]): educators reported reduced critical thinking, scientific writing, and decision-making abilities. Pedagogical erosion (35/46, 76%): decreased student interaction and reduced teaching innovation. Motivational decline (31/46, 67%): increased procrastination and reduced intrinsic motivation. Ethical risks (24/46, 52%): concerns about plagiarism and overuse of AI-generated content. Social fragmentation (22/46, 48%): diminished peer collaboration and mentorship. Creativity suppression (20/46, 43%): reliance on AI for content generation diluted instructional originality. Strategies reported by participants to address these issues included establishing boundaries for AI use (n=41), fostering hybrid intelligence (n=37), and integrating AI literacy into teaching practices (n=39).
Conclusions
While AI tools can enhance digital health instruction, unchecked reliance risks eroding essential clinician competencies. This study identifies cognitive, pedagogical, and ethical consequences of AI overuse in medical education and highlights the need for AI literacy, professional development, and ethical frameworks to ensure responsible and balanced integration.}

Chemical analysis revealed that the average concentrations of heavy metals in both sediments and water increase from upstream to downstream. There is no clear significant relationship observed between changes in the values of investigated elements in sediments and water. The levels of these elements in the sediments, exceed toxic response thresholds. In the water samples, As, Ni and V concentrations exceed the WHO standard values. According to the Igeo, EF and PLI indices, the sediments at most stations are not contaminated by any of the elements. The CF and Dc indices suggest low contamination levels at all stations. The NIPI and ecological risk indices (Er and RI) indicate non-polluted conditions at all stations except SF22, SF20, SF11, and SF6. The MI and HEI indices indicate pollution in all water samples of the Sefid-rud, but critical values are only observed at SF5 and SF15. The other stations show no contamination. The Cf index indicates high pollution levels for all elements except Cu, Zn, and Pb. The upstream area poses a relatively high and considerable ecological risk according to the PERI index. In conclusion, the sediments of the Sefid-rud River have a higher potential for the exchange of toxic substances compared to the aquatic environment.}

Two hundred pre-service teachers assessed four randomly assigned texts from learners in grade six. Their assessment was compared to the existing ratings of two experts from a previous study. We found a relative judgment accuracy between r = .34 and .60 for the nine assessment criteria, with vocabulary being assessed significantly more accurately than almost all other criteria. Orthography, complexity and correctness of syntax and grammar and punctuation were rated with significantly more accuracy than cohesion, level of detail, communicative effect and coherence. The pre-service teachers assessed most criteria more strictly and with higher variability than the experts. The results suggest that teacher education should offer pre-service teachers concrete opportunities to practise writing assessment, implement activities to strengthen the assessment of content- and structure-related criteria, and help them adjust their assessment rigour.}

This issue is particularly severe for thermal reaction bonding material extrusion systems, where the motion and the deposition processes are coupled. To enhance the deposition accuracy, this work established a method to use real-time in-situ thermal images to capture and compensate for the geometrical accuracy of the printed parts and establish the spatial and temporal relationship between the inaccuracy and the deposition trajectory commands. The paper derives an analytical slender condition to process the printing regions with low curvature while establishing deposition direction allocation methods to account for the trajectory regions with high curvature. Real-time thermal image localization is performed with key printing feature detection and calibration. The localized and calibrated thermal images are aligned with the defined deposition direction to acquire the deposition inaccuracies. With the deposition dynamics considered, the deposition inaccuracy is reduced via dynamic deposition rate compensation. The proposed thermal imaging and compensation techniques have been experimentally verified with a material extrusion experimental platform to illustrate its capabilities to alleviate the deposition inaccuracy during the corner regions.}

These will range from networked Cyber-Physical Systems to edge computing devices, establishing real-time feedback control loops critical for managing Industry 5.0 deployments, digital agriculture systems, and essential infrastructures. The provision of extensive machine-type communications through 6G will render many of these innovative systems autonomous and unsupervised. While full automation will enhance industrial efficiency significantly, it concurrently introduces new cyber risks and vulnerabilities. In particular, unattended systems are highly susceptible to trust issues: malicious nodes and false information can be easily introduced into control loops. Additionally, Denial-of-Service attacks can be executed by inundating the network with valueless noise. Current anomaly detection schemes require the entire transformation of the control software to integrate new steps and can only mitigate anomalies that conform to predefined mathematical models. Solutions based on an exhaustive data collection to detect anomalies are precise but extremely slow. Standard models, with their limited understanding of mobile networks, can achieve precision rates no higher than 75%. Therefore, more general and transversal protection mechanisms are needed to detect malicious behaviors transparently. This paper introduces a probabilistic trust model and control algorithm designed to address this gap. The model determines the probability of any node to be trustworthy. Communication channels are pruned for those nodes whose probability is below a given threshold. The trust control algorithm comprises three primary phases, which feed the model with three different probabilities, which are weighted and combined. Initially, anomalous nodes are identified using Gaussian mixture models and clustering technologies. Next, traffic patterns are studied using digital Bessel functions and the functional scalar product. Finally, the information coherence and content are analyzed. The noise content and abnormal information sequences are detected using a Volterra filter and a bank of Finite Impulse Response filters. An experimental validation based on simulation tools and environments was carried out. Results show the proposed solution can successfully detect up to 92% of malicious data injection attacks.}

abstract = {Fungi are essential members of ecosystems, playing key roles in nutrient cycling, agriculture, and medicine. Their classification into proper species helps us to understand their biodiversity, allowing us to leverage their ecological and practical benefits. A new hybrid deep learning-based technique has been proposed, merging the Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer models with transfer learning frameworks like MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0 for Fungi multiclass classification. This study utilized a publicly available dataset containing 9115 images of five fungal species from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. To address significant class imbalance, several data augmentation techniques were employed. The results showed that the Swin Transformer combined with DenseNet121 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 96.96 % for training, 95.97 % for validation, and 95.57 % for testing, while other models like ViT-DenseNet121 and Swin-MobileNetV2 also delivered competitive results. Using confusion matrices and benchmark classification metrics, and paired statistical testing, the analysis highlights the models' ability to generalize effectively and minimize misclassifications. To further ensure the robustness of the findings, a five-fold cross-validation was performed across all hybrid models. Additionally, explainable AI techniques, specifically Grad-CAM visualizations, were employed to interpret the model's focus areas, confirming attention to biologically significant structures. This research demonstrates a balance between modeling local features and capturing global context. Indeed, these hybrid models prove to be scalable and efficient for complex biological datasets. This interdisciplinary study bridges ecology and advanced technology by applying deep learning to enhance fungal classification. This study aims to improve the management and understanding of fungal biodiversity for the promotion of conservational and sustainable practices for the betterment of our ecosystem. The findings have significant applications, including sustainable agriculture through early detection of fungal plant pathogens, improved medical diagnostics for fungal infections, and biodiversity conservation through precise species monitoring.}

abstract = {Firewood is a key energy source in developing countries, but its consideration for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) purposes suffers from both data and methodological issues. A specific literature review revealed considerable variability in the way these issues have been addressed in existing studies. To improve current practices, a framework for proper inclusion of all environmental impacts related to traditional firewood uses is proposed, and a configurable dataset for other studies was produced. The framework was then applied to a case study on shea butter production, where firewood accounting appeared to be one of the main sources of discrepancies in the results of existing studies. For each parameter related to firewood uses and their impacts, data and methodological choices that LCA practitioners may face were then investigated through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Firewood consumption volumes and emission factors from firewood combustion proved to be the most critical parameters for all environmental issues, and the options explored in this study to tackle these data collection issues can be adapted to other case studies. Beyond data matters, the main methodological challenge for firewood accounting lies in estimating the fraction of firewood from non-renewable sources. Use of the default values from the spatially explicit supply-demand WISDOM model is recommended here. For the shea butter value chain in Burkina Faso, one of the main solutions for mitigating environmental impacts would be to reduce firewood consumption by promoting improved cookstoves, improving boiling practices, or replacing firewood with other biomass sources, such as shea nutshells.}

abstract = {Despite the importance of critical evaluation of online information, many teachers struggle to integrate evaluation instruction in their disciplinary teaching. This study examined the contribution of a professional development (PD) program designed to foster teachers’ capabilities to cultivate critical evaluation competencies in their disciplines. Grounded in the AIR model of epistemic thinking, the program focused on supporting teachers in promoting students’ evaluation Aims, evaluation Ideals (criteria), and Reliable evaluation processes (strategies) across the regular curriculum. Teachers collaboratively learned, designed, and taught evaluation activities that were intended to foster these elements. We report on the program’s initial implementation with seven junior high school teachers and their students (N = 118), who were assigned to intervention and control groups. Using a mixed-method design, we administered assessments of information source evaluation to teachers and students before and after the intervention. Qualitative data sources included teacher interviews, teacher reflections, classroom observations, and PD meeting transcripts. Following the PD, teachers’ critical evaluation competencies became more elaborate and explicit. All of the teachers integrated information source evaluation in their instruction and adapted or designed evaluation activities that were tailored to their disciplines. Teachers faced challenges related to the complexities of integrating evaluation instruction in disciplinary topics, metacognitive instruction, and curriculum structure. Following the PD, students increasingly used source evaluation criteria, but there were no changes in their evaluation strategies. These results demonstrate the potential of the PD model and identify challenges that may inform future PD initiatives.}

abstract = {Purpose
For a digital fashion startup, being acquired by a large company can be a viable growth strategy, but consumers may view it as a departure from the startup’s original identity and question its commitment to core values, its perceived brand authenticity. Despite the potential risks to perceived brand authenticity, little is known about its key predictors in the context of startup acquisitions. Drawing from the heuristic–systematic model and cue diagnosticity theory, this study aims to examine the effects of two systematic factors (acquirer reputation and the startup’s operational independence) and a heuristic factor (company size linked to a consumer lay theory about greed) on brand authenticity.
Design/methodology/approach
Via two online experimental studies, data were collected from 401 US consumers (Study 1: 101, Study 2: 300). Data were analyzed through SPSS PROCESS macro mediation and moderation analyses and ANCOVA.
Findings
In Study 1, the authors established a consumer lay theory that larger companies are perceived as greedier, which in turn increases perceived mercenary intent. In Study 2, acquirer reputation significantly predicted perceived brand authenticity, whereas operational independence did not. Notably, the lay theory did not influence perceived brand authenticity in the mergers and acquisitions context.
Originality/value
For startups and prospective acquirers, the findings offer practical suggestions that can help ensure the long-term viability of the acquisition.}

abstract = {Recently, the concept of mobile labour has garnered increasing attention among mobilities scholars. Yet, the preponderance of research has emphasised workers’ movements that are fairly large-scale and routes-based. This paper proposes another kind of mobility that is of equal significance—that of micro-mobilities by labour, or more accurately by their bodies. Using original research conducted through semi-structured interviews with 40 customer service agents working in an international airport in Asia, the paper examines three kinds of aesthetic labour that these workers perform alongside passengers. Enacted through various bodily motions intended to speed up aeromobile processes and augment productivity, I argue that these performances produce a (tenuous) aesthetics of assuring presence, orderly movement, and passing time. As more and more work tasks are redistributed across the airport between staff and passengers, ‘new’ automation presents an opportunity to reflect on the mobile practices being invented as self-service technologies infiltrate customer service and other work where human relations and decision-making skills are required. More broadly, it also uncovers the gendered politics of bodily comport, gaits, gestures and other micro-movements in labour (re)production in a wider age of technological change.}

abstract = {This study used high-frequency (HF) nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) sensor data to explore the uncertainty of calculating NO3-N loads in two headwater streams (Horndrup and Lyby-Grønning) with infrequent sample collection. Accurate annual and monthly N load estimates are crucial for cost-efficient management of N in catchments and for correct calibration and validation of catchment models like SWAT. Ultraviolet (UV) NO3-N sensors were installed in the two agricultural headwater streams for two hydrological years (June 2021 to May 2023) to measure NO3-N concentrations every minute. The cleaned dataset was used to investigate NO3-N load estimates using a Monte Carlo approach, with 1000 simulations for five infrequent sampling strategies: daily, weekly, fortnightly, 18 annual samples, and monthly samples. Bias (Flux Bias Statistic), precision (standard deviation), and total uncertainty (RMSE) were calculated for the annual and monthly NO3-N loads. Richards-Baker Flashiness Index (RBI) was used to explore the influence of hydrology on differences between HF and infrequent sampling. The sampling strategy needed to meet a bias and achieve RMSE <2 %, 5 %, and 10 % for monthly loads was explored. The uncertainty of the load estimates increased with fewer grab samples. The bias and RMSE of the annual load estimates from the five strategies were <±7.7 % and <10.3 %, respectively. Monthly NO3-N loads had higher uncertainties, with average bias and RMSE of ±4 % and 15 % (max. −13 % and 28 %) in Horndrup Stream and ±7 % and 27 % (max. 89 % and 194 %) in Lyby-Grønning Stream. In Horndrup Stream, a significant negative linear relationship between the bias of monthly NO3-N loads and RBI indicated higher underestimation with more storm events. In Lyby-Grønning Stream, precision decreased with higher RBI.}

To assess the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of keratoconus (KC) in standalone Scheimpflug-based dynamic corneal deformation videos.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Participants
We retrospectively analyzed datasets with records of 734 nonconsecutive, refractive surgery candidates, and patients with unilateral or bilateral KC.
Methods
We first developed a video preprocessing pipeline to translate dynamic corneal deformation videos into 3-dimensional pseudoimage representations and then trained a CNN to directly identify KC from pseudoimages. We calculated the model's KC probability score cut-off and evaluated the performance by subjective and objective accuracy metrics using 2 independent datasets.
Main Outcome Measures
Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and KC probability score.
Results
The model accuracy on the test subset was 0.89 with AUC of 0.94. Based on the external validation dataset, the AUC and accuracy of the CNN model for detecting KC were 0.93 and 0.88, respectively.
Conclusions
Our deep learning-based approach was highly sensitive and specific in separating normal from keratoconic eyes using dynamic corneal deformation videos at levels that may prove useful in clinical practice.

Based on their structural information and immune-enhancing activity data, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was used for prediction, and Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm was exploited for explanation structure-activity relationship of these raspberry polysaccharides in the present study. The structural information and immune activity data of raspberry polysaccharides were respectively used as input and output in the ANN model. The training and testing losses of ANN model was no longer decreased after trained for 200 epochs. The mean-square error (MSE) of training set and test set stabilized around 0.003 and 0.013, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of training set and test set were 0.21 % and 0.98 %, indicating the trained ANN model converged well and exhibited strong robustness. The interpretability analysis showed that molecular weight, content of arabinose, galactose or galacturonic acid, and glycosyl linkage patterns of →3)-Arap-(1→, Araf-(1→, →4)-Galp-(1 → were the main structural factors greatly affecting the immune-enhancing activity of raspberry polysaccharides. This work may provide a new perspective for the study of structure-activity relationship of polysaccharides.}

abstract = {To achieve efficient cooling of the multi-chip collaborative module with high heat flux, an annular nozzle dry ice particle jet fluid cooling method is proposed. The physical models of the multi-chip collaborative module, annular nozzle and heat sink are established. The multi-chip collaborative module consists of one logic chip with a heat flux of 295.86 W/cm2, and four High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips each with a heat flux of 52.08 W/cm2. Due to the difference in chip heat flux, pin fins are added to the internal copper base plate of the heat sink above the logic chip. In this paper, the method of numerical simulation is adopted, by changing the inclined angle of the annular nozzle outlet, the height of the heat sink, the size and distribution of the pin fins and other structural parameters, as well as the inlet fluid velocity of the nozzle and the proportion of dry ice and other thermal parameters, the cooling and heat transfer characteristics of the multi-chip collaborative module with a safety temperature of 378 K for the logic chip and 358 K for the HBM chip are simulated. The results show that the model with an annular nozzle outlet inclined at 60°, a heat sink height of ​​20 mm​​, and ​​a 6 × 6 arrangement of pin fins​​ with a diameter of ​​3 mm​​ and a height of ​​15 mm​​ ​​provides the optimal performance​​ for dry ice particle jet cooling. The greater the inlet velocity of the dry ice particle fluid and the higher the dry ice proportion at the inlet, the better the cooling effect of the chip. When the dry ice proportion at nozzle inlet is 0.3, as the nozzle inlet velocity increases from 1 to 4 m/s, maximum temperature at the logic chip undersurface decreases by 95.7 K. When the nozzle inlet fluid velocity is 3 m/s, as the dry ice proportion at the nozzle inlet increases from 0.1 to 0.2, maximum temperature at the logic chip undersurface decreases by 114.15 K. When the nozzle inlet velocity is 12 m/s and the dry ice proportion is 0.5, the heat flux of the annular nozzle dry ice particle jet fluid cooling multi-chip collaborative module is as high as 650 W/cm2 for the logic chip and 450 W/cm2 for the HBM chip. When the nozzle inlet velocity is 12 m/s and the dry ice proportion is 0.5, the total thermal resistance of the logic chip and the HBM chip decreases by 2.2 cm2·K/W and 10.57 cm2·K/W, respectively, compared to when the nozzle inlet velocity is 1 m/s and the dry ice proportion is 0.1. Based on the results of this paper, the quantitative relationship is fitted between the maximum temperature at the undersurface of the logic chip and the heat flux under different inlet fluid velocity and the proportion of dry ice. The research results provide targeted theoretical support and data references for the cooling scheme design, thermal performance regulation, and reliability improvement of multi-chip integration modules.}

We draw on a range of related fields to further develop this framework, questioning the notion of a singular and homogeneous understanding of language. We not only move beyond a monolingual focus to embrace a more inclusive understanding of language(s) and their sociocultural underpinnings, but, drawing on the ‘ontological turn’ and its exploration of diverse worlds, we theorise language as a dynamic assemblage of elements that emerges uniquely in each performance or practice, grounded in specific contexts. Our contribution aims to expand the understanding of language as multifaceted and ever evolving phenomena, reflecting on a range of themes and questions, including how we might pluralise language within Western modernity. Is language the same across all contexts of contemporary western societies or within Western modernity? Does language apply only to human groups? How do nonhuman others perform language(s)/languaging? In challenging existing assumptions regarding what language is or what it might be, our research invites others to explore new possibilities in their examination of language(s), languaging, and semiotic practices.}
