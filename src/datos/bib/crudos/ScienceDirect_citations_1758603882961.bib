In May 2023, a Hylomma sp. nymph was collected in SE Romania from a long-distance migrant host, the Pied Wheatear (Oenanthe pleschanka) with known migratory route. The tick was identified morphologically and genetically as H. rufipes and based on the timing of the migratory track it attached to its avian host in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East. This is the first ever H. rufipes recorded in Europe with known Middle Eastern/Asian origin.}

abstract = {In urban landscape design, the optimization of spatial layout is very important because it directly affects the functionality, ecological benefits and aesthetic effects of the landscape. This paper introduces a generative algorithm to optimize the layout of garden space elements. It aims to improve the rationality, aesthetics and functionality of the layout scheme through automation and intelligence, so as to better adapt to different environments and user needs. First, a geometric model of the urban landscape space is constructed, and the functional areas, green spaces, water bodies and other elements of the garden are converted into design constraints and objective functions suitable for generative algorithm processing. Then, using genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, through the iterative evolution process of the population, the position, form and combination of spatial elements are gradually adjusted to achieve the predetermined design goals. Finally, the fitness function is introduced to evaluate the pros and cons of each generation of layout schemes, including the openness of the landscape view, the coherence of the functional areas and the aesthetic evaluation. Through multiple iterations, the algorithm gradually converges to the optimal solution and provides a garden layout scheme that meets specific needs. In the layout optimization under complex terrain, the space utilization rate is between 75.0% and 77.8%. The landscape view is distributed between 66.3% and 68.0%, which is relatively evenly distributed. The urban landscape garden space element layout optimization method based on the generative algorithm introduced in this paper not only improves the design efficiency and accuracy but also provides new ideas for urban garden planning.}

This study explores how color temperature serves as a heuristic-based nudge to alter individuals' dining behaviors at restaurants. The findings of three experimental studies consistently demonstrate that color temperature affects individuals' perceptions of food healthiness, food tastiness, and their food consumption intentions. A cool-colored food image enhances perceptions of food healthiness and aligns with healthy dining information to influence individuals' consumption intentions. Conversely, a warm-colored food image is more effective at promoting taste-oriented food consumption. These results expand our understanding of how color influences consumer dining behaviors and offer valuable insights for hospitality practitioners to promote healthy dining through color adjustments.}

The earliest paradigm (craft production) and the current transformation (regionalized/personalized production) share a fundamental characteristic—high product variety and low product volume. In both cases, co-creation between the customer and the producer is essential. In the co-creation process, high-level product information (i.e., linguistic descriptions of a product) must be translated into machine-readable formats such as CAD models. However, the short design cycle and the lack of necessary tools and expertise in CAD modeling pose significant challenges. This study examines a fundamental issue: how to frame the CAD model creation problem in a way that enables novice users to obtain a desired solution efficiently. Findings indicate that empathetic adaptation provides structured guidelines for iterative prompting, helping novices navigate CAD modeling tasks more effectively. The study thus highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT) in addressing highly knowledge-intensive challenges within personalized production.}

By integrating learning behavior analysis and sentiment analysis, the Random Forest (RF) model is used to deeply mine students’ learning behavior data, such as analyzing learning time, resource access frequency, etc., to precisely understand students’ learning patterns. At the same time, with the help of sentiment analysis technology based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), students’ emotional states during the learning process are monitored in real-time, including positive, negative, neutral, and other emotions. The experimental results show that by dynamically adjusting the learning path and monitoring students’ emotional states, students’ average scores increase by 6.0%, and homework completion rate increases by 4.4%. This study not only improves the overall quality of education, but also provides educators with more scientific decision-making support tools.}

abstract = {Fake reviews corrode the trust between businesses and consumers and distort the online image of a service or a product. The problem of fake review contamination is only going to worsen with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), that allow even novice users to massively produce fake reviews that can easily be mistaken for real. In this paper, we study a particular type of fake review attack, the AI-paraphrased reviews generated with ChatGPT 4.0. For this, we use an efficient pattern detection algorithm to quantify the similarity between the paraphrased and original reviews. We use a dataset that consists of 400 reviews spanning 20 hotels around the globe and 6000 fake reviews through Open AI API. Our results show that as the word length pattern increases, the mean similarity ratio between original (human) and AI paraphrased texts converge to 0 % while it stays above 20 % between AI-paraphrased texts. This pattern is consistent for reviews of hotels with diverse geographic locations. In this way, we introduce the importance of text similarity detection as a feature that could be incorporated to the design of future fake review detection algorithms. This method can be generalized to other applications where AI paraphrased text detection is necessary.}

abstract = {Background
MET gene exon 14 skipping was identified as a potential driver mutation that occurs in approximately 3%-4% of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), typically in the absence of other driver mutations. Capmatinib and tepotinib were the first MET- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MET-TKIs) approved by the FDA and PMDA, specifically for patients with metastatic NSCLC. Several studies have reported acquired resistance after MET-TKI treatment for MET mutation-positive NSCLC. Sequencing of the MET kinase region of resistant cell lines revealed secondary mutations at residues D1228 and Y1230 that were sensitive to type II MET-TKIs, such as cabozantinib. This suggested that sequential administration of other MET-TKIs may overcome the development of secondary mutations after acquired resistance in MET exon 14 mutation-positive NSCLC.
Methods
We designed the single arm phase II study CAPTURE Trial to assess the efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC with activating MET exon 14 alterations who developed acquired resistance to tepotinib or capmatinib, as well as after 2 prior chemotherapy regimens that included platinum and docetaxel. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by independent review committees. The sample size (n = 30) is calculated by assuming a threshold response rate of 5% and an expected response rate of 25%. Recruitment began in August 2024.
Results
This ongoing study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib after acquired resistance to tepotinib or capmatinib.}

abstract = {Grayscale conversion plays a crucial role in image processing, particularly for edge detection and segmentation tasks, where decolorization quality directly impacts subsequent analysis. An ideal decolorization algorithm should be both efficient and robust while preserving color consistency and detail contrast. In this study, we revisit the RTCP (Real-time Contrast-Preserving Decolorization) algorithm and propose three key optimizations: a clustering-guided decolorization approach, a locally adaptive decolorization strategy, and a weight-optimized decolorization method. To enhance solution quality, we implement a constrained particle swarm optimization framework to systematically explore the parameter space. Experimental validation on two standard datasets (Ĉadík and CSDD) demonstrates that our optimized methods handle diverse decolorization scenarios more effectively while maintaining competitive performance against existing approaches. Recognizing the limitations of current evaluation metrics in assessing detail contrast preservation, we introduce the D-C2G-SSIM metric for more accurate quantitative assessment. Comparative results show consistent improvements over the original RTCP algorithm, with the average D-C2G-SSIM score increasing from 0.8331 to 0.8442 on Ĉadík dataset and from 0.8696 to 0.8847 on the CSDD dataset, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.}

abstract = {Permeability is one of the most important properties of porous media, governing fluid flow and transport in subsurface reservoirs. However, accurately calculating permeability through conventional numerical simulations can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with complex pore structures. Therefore, rapid and precise prediction of permeability from digital rock images using deep learning and image-based regression is of particular interest. Yet, the generalizability and strength of deep learning models in computer vision tasks are often limited by low variability of existing datasets and labeling efforts. To mitigate such challenges, in this work, we introduce a new framework for improving permeability prediction with two complementary strategies. First, we expand the dataset by creating synthetic 2D digital rock images based on a diffusion model, which adds further data to the training set. Second, we embrace transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models, thus increasing predictive performance in terms of permeability estimation tasks even without the presence of a large number of labeled samples. The framework presented demonstrates greater accuracy and generalization compared to traditional approaches, thus facilitating more reliable permeability prediction in the area of digital rock analysis. The innovation demonstrates potential for the use of generative modeling and transfer learning to drive data-driven solutions in subsurface characterization.}

Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) requires long-term adherence to oral anticoagulation and self-care.
Methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a smartphone-based relational agent and heart rhythm monitor with the primary outcome of anticoagulation adherence and secondary outcomes of quality of life (QOL) and health care utilization. The trial enrolled individuals with Atrial fibrillation (AF) taking anticoagulation. Intervention participants received a smartphone-based relational agent for disease education, adherence monitoring, and self-care, and a heart rate and rhythm monitor. Attention control participants received a smartphone health education application and the same heart monitor. Participants had baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-month visits. The primary outcome was 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC) ascertained with pharmacy claims.
Results
From January, 2020 to April, 2022, the trial enrolled 243 participants (age 70.8 ± 9.8 years; 64.2% female; 30.5% Black race). The adjusted mean PDC at 12 months in the intervention arm was 0.88 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.84-0.93) and in the attention control 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.90) with no difference in odds of PDC ≥ 0.80 in intervention compared to the control (Odds Ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.66-2.38]). Self-reported nonadherence and QOL did not differ by study arm. The event rates for health care utilization were significantly less for intervention than attention control participants as measured by emergency room visits and hospitalizations (P < .001) and number of days hospitalized (P = .004).
Conclusion
The smartphone-based relational agent intervention did not achieve its primary endpoint of increased anticoagulation adherence but did yield decreased health care utilization.

abstract = {Background
Patients undergoing inpatient allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) often experience psychological consequences. care.coach AvatarTM is a tablet-based ‘human-in-the-loop’ virtual health assistant (VHA) that uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) to provide psychosocial support. It has improved loneliness, depression, anxiety, hospital delirium, and falls in older adults in the hospital (Bott, J Med Internet Res 2019).
Methods
We adapted the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT. The VHA engages patients with reminders for hydration, medications, food, or activity; HCT education modules; playing games; playing the news or music; having free-form conversations; going through therapeutic activities and exercises; and practicing mindfulness and guided meditation. Avatar protocols were updated based on feedback from a structured focus group (n=10) of nurse navigators, inpatient HCT nurses, and HCT physicians at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. 7 HCT-specific educational modules were created. A feasibility pilot was performed in 3 sequential cohorts of 6 patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT. In the first cohort, patients were given the VHAs without any recommendations for how long to use them. The second cohort was given a recommendation for 30 minutes per day, and the third cohort was offered a $20 gift card for completion of at least 4 modules. Responses were measured through patient surveys and engagement data analysis. Predefined retention rate for feasibility was 67%, a standard for introduction of a novel AI technology (Teresi, Med Care 2022). Dissatisfaction rate for the overall VHA experience was defined as responding “disagree” or “strongly disagree” with recommending the VHA to others.
Results
The study included 18 patients (Table). Retention rate from enrollment to discharge or three weeks (whichever came first) was 78% (95% CI: 52-94%). A post-pilot survey was completed by 16 patients (90%), revealing a dissatisfaction rate of 28%. Dissatisfaction rates decreased from 50% to 20% to 0% across the 3 cohorts. Frequency of completion of the post-pilot survey for the full study was 72% within 1 week of disenrollment, and 90% overall. Average completion rate was 52% for all seven HCT modules in the whole study population. Across cohorts, module completion rates changed from 5% to 88% to 62%, reflecting guidance to patients. VHA functions by most time of usage were music (35%), exercise (20%), and education (15%; Figure).
Conclusions
The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT patients. Despite modest dissatisfaction and variability in completion rates, the VHA showed promise in providing HCT education, social, and emotional support for inpatient RIC HCT. Further research is needed, including the potential application for outpatient HCT.}

abstract = {Background
Through third party applications, patients in the United States have access to their electronic health record (EHR) data from multiple health care providers. However, these applications offer only a predefined organization of these records by type, time stamp, or provider, leaving out meaningful connections between them. This prevents patients from efficiently reviewing, exploring, and making sense of their EHR data based on current or ongoing health issues. The lack of personalized organization and important connections can limit patients’ ability to use their data and make informed health decisions.
Objective
To address these challenges, we created Discovery, an experimental app that enables patients to organize their medical records into collections, analogous to placing pictures in photo albums. These collections are based on the evolving understanding of the patients’ past and ongoing health issues. The app also allows patients to add text notes to collections and their constituent records. By observing how patients used features to select records and assemble them into collections, our goal was to learn about their preferred mechanisms to complete these tasks and the challenges they would face in the wild. We also intended to become more informed about the various ways in which patients could and would like to use collections.
Methods
We conducted a think-aloud evaluation study with 14 participants on synthetic data. In session 1, we obtained feedback on the mechanics for creating and assembling collections and adding notes. In session 2, we focused on reviewing collections, finding data patterns within them, and retaining insights, as well as exploring use cases. We conducted reflexive thematic analysis on the transcribed feedback.
Results
Collections were useful for personal use (quick access to information, reflection on medical history, tracking health, journaling, and learning from past experiences) and clinical visits (preparation and raising physicians’ awareness). Assembling EHR data into reliable collections could be difficult for typical patients due to considerable manual work and lack of medical knowledge. However, automated collection building could alleviate this issue. Furthermore, having EHR data organized in collections may have limited use. However, augmenting them with patient-generated data, which are entered with flexible richness and structure, could add context, elevate meaning, and improve actionability. Finally, collections might produce a misconstrued health picture, but bringing the physician in the loop for verification could increase their clinical validity.
Conclusions
Collections can be a powerful tool for advancing patients’ proactivity, awareness, and self-advocacy, potentially facilitating patient-centered care. However, patients need better support for incorporating their own everyday data and adding meaningful annotations for future reference. Improvements in the comprehensiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the collection assembly process through automation are also necessary.}

abstract = {Background
Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are common complications after surgery and anaesthesia, particularly in older adults, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Therefore, major medical societies have developed recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PNDs. Our study evaluated the reliability of large language models, specifically ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, in generating recommendations for PND management and comparing them with published guidelines.
Methods
We conducted an online cross-sectional web-based analysis over 48 h in June 2024. Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated recommendations were produced in six different locations across five countries (Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Canada, and the East and West Coasts of the USA). The English prompt ‘a table of a bundle of care for perioperative neurocognitive disorders’ was entered into ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, generating tables evaluated by independent reviewers. The primary outcomes were the Total Disagreement Score (TDS) and Quality Assessment of Medical Artificial Intelligence (QAMAI), which compared AI-generated recommendations with published guidelines.
Results
The study generated 14 tables, with TDS and QAMAI scores showing similar results for ChatGPT-4 and Gemini (2 [1–3] vs 2 [2–3], P=0.636 and 4 [4–4] vs 4 [3–4], P=0.424, respectively). AI-generated recommendations aligned well with published guidelines, with the highest alignment observed in ChatGPT-4-generated recommendations. No complete agreement with guidelines was achieved, and lack of cited sources was a noted limitation.
Conclusions
Large language models can generate perioperative neurocognitive disorder recommendations that align closely with published guidelines. However, further validation and integration of clinician feedback are required before clinical application.}

This study investigates the nuanced relationship between generative AI use and university students' self-efficacy and technological dependence, illuminating the underlying paradoxes and implications for inclusive education practices. Through a survey of 348 university students, with 200 valid responses analyzed, we uncover the direct and indirect impacts of generative AI usage frequency on AI dependence. Our findings reveal a paradoxical effect: enhanced AI usage significantly amplifies students' confidence and efficiency in learning, yet simultaneously intensifies their dependence on AI. This dual impact both supports and complicates the incorporation of AI technologies into educational settings, underscoring the need for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in teaching and learning. Our study underscores the critical importance of a nuanced understanding of AI's role in education. It highlights the necessity of crafting an educational landscape where technology augments learning processes without compromising independent learning capabilities. By navigating the complex interplay between technological advancement and educational inclusivity, our findings guide the development of AI-assisted learning environments that are not only effective but also equitable and accessible.}

One approach to reduce the environmental impacts of wind turbines and their components is the application of circular economy strategies. This study focuses on high-strength connection bolts, specifically M36 threaded steel bolts with a length of 660 mm. A comparative life cycle assessment is conducted to analyze the environmental impacts of two scenarios: recycling all bolts at the end of the wind turbine’s life cycle, and reusing some bolts after inspection. The product system is modeled in openLCA, where the processes of the foreground system are linked to the Ecoinvent database in the background system. For life cycle impact assessment, the ReCiPe 2016 method is applied, focusing on climate impact. Results show that after five life cycles, reusing bolts reduces the climate impact by 48%, compared to a 42% reduction through recycling alone. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the potential for impact reduction through reuse is primarily driven by the achievable reuse rate, while factors such as production technology, electricity mix, and transportation distances play a smaller role.}

abstract = {Opioids are frequently prescribed for postsurgical and acute pain management for both adults and children. However, research has shown that overprescription and improper handling of these medications contribute to problematic substance use, dependency, and overdose among the pediatric population. Despite increased awareness and efforts to mitigate the opioid epidemic, challenges persist, including inconsistent prescribing practices, inadequate education on safe disposal practices, gaps in prescription monitoring systems, and barriers to naloxone availability. In this review, we will highlight actionable steps and strategies for advocacy and intervention to reduce the burden of the opioid crisis in children and adolescents. Key topics include the critical role of opioid stewardship when managing postoperative pain, the importance of family engagement and education on safe disposal methods, the ongoing challenges of safe prescribing and monitoring, and opportunities to extend substance use screening and treatment referral for injured adolescents. Additionally, we will highlight policy recommendations to promote equitable access and availability of harm reduction tools such as naloxone. These strategies, if implemented together, can significantly reduce the risks associated with pediatric opioid use and mitigate the impact of the opioid epidemic on children and adolescents.}

abstract = {Advances in different approaches to critical quantitative statistics have been extensively used across various fields, with a wealth of empirical research illustrating applications and results. In education and other disciplines interested in disrupting White supremacy embodied across much of today’s policy and procedures, there is an increasing call to incorporate a diverse range of critical approaches to research methods. This pivoting aims to challenge the marginalization of subaltern ways of knowing, which has resulted in a tradition of reliance on (post-)positivist frameworks that limit the scope of research inference and validity. Critical psychometrics has become central in shaping our understanding of measurement, its accuracy, and the rationale behind approaches to code self-reported demographic categories as stable, fixed, and accurate estimates of oppression. This paper provides two mixed-methods survey study examples where these assumptions unsettle the notion that self-report demographics measure comparative indices of identity. Implications of this critical quantitative psychometric appraisal challenges the taken-for-granted nature of self-reported demographics; that is, these essentialized identity categories should be used to accurately and precisely compare differences between disability, race, class, gender, socioeconomic status, and educational background. With the validity theory behind this assumption challenged, this work provides a starting point, a stake in the ground, to pursue diverse methods to validate self-reports.}

abstract = {Introduction
Sickle cell trait (SCT) is a hereditary condition that affects millions worldwide, predominantly in individuals of African, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern descent. While traditionally considered a benign carrier state, emerging evidence suggests a potential association between SCT and malignancies. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between SCT and the risk of multiple myeloma, renal cancer, leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colorectal cancer.
Methods
This study utilized de-identified electronic health records from the TriNetX database, covering a 20-year period. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to assess cancer incidence and survival outcomes among SCT and sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Statistical analyses included risk difference (RD), risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and hazard ratios (HR) to determine associations between SCT and cancer risk.
Results
SCT was not associated with an increased risk for most cancers. However, individuals with SCT had a significantly lower risk of leukemia compared to those with SCD (RR =0.464, OR = 0.463, p < 0.001), suggesting a potential protective effect. Conversely, a modest but statistically insignificant increase in renal cancer risk was observed in SCT individuals (RR = 1.201, OR = 1.202, p = 0.059). No significant associations were found between SCT and multiple myeloma, HCC, or colorectal cancer.
Discussion
These findings highlight a complex relationship between SCT and malignancy risk. The observed protective effect against leukemia suggests a potential hematopoietic or immune-mediated mechanism. Meanwhile, the slight increase in renal cancer risk may be linked to chronic kidney stress and hematuria. Further studies are needed to validate these associations and investigate underlying biological mechanisms.
Conclusion
SCT does not significantly increase cancer risk overall but may confer protection against leukemia while showing a potential, though inconclusive, link to renal cancer. These findings emphasize the need for continued surveillance and further epidemiological studies to refine cancer risk assessment in SCT populations.}

abstract = {Purpose
Only a few studies have explored how compassion is taught to nursing students. This study aimed to investigate the differences in compassionate flow among nursing students both before and after an educational intervention.
Materials and methods
This study employed a cluster randomised controlled trial design in medical schools in Taiwan. We enrolled first- and second-year nursing students. The intervention group underwent dance movement therapy, while the control group received yoga training. Compassionate flow was assessed using the Compassionate Engagement and Action Scale and the Fears of Compassion Scale.
Results
A total of 59 participants (31 in the experimental group and 28 in the control group) were included in the final statistical analysis, and an 82 % response rate was recorded. Statistically significant differences were observed in total scores on the Compassionate Engagement and Action Scales, along with compassion for self and compassion from other subscales between the experimental and control groups (p < .05). The η2 effect levels were 0.12, 0.12, and 0.09.
Conclusions
Educational training employing dance movement therapy demonstrated enhancements in self-compassion and compassion for others among first- and second-year nursing students.}

In response to the pain points of college students, such as limitations in knowledge learning, academic emotional distress, weak innovation awareness, and insufficient problem-solving abilities, a new method that combines Extenics with the latest generation of AI technology is proposed. By analyzing the process, mechanism, variables, and implementation path of handling contradictory problems, a new paradigm for the intelligent handling of contradictory problems through the dual-helix integration of the human brain, information resources, and AI is constructed. This helps college students break through the bottlenecks of the knowledge explosion and lack of innovation and builds an intelligent "bridge" from big data to innovative solutions. It provides a new idea for cultivating and improving students’ problem-solving abilities.}
