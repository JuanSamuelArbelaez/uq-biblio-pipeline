Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has emerged as a public health priority due to its high prevalence, silent clinical course, and liver and systemic outcomes. With an estimated prevalence of 30% in the general population, MASLD is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Apart from the underlying metabolic factors, MASLD development and progression are strongly influenced by social and commercial determinants of health, and an associated stigma, which perpetuate inequities and hinder access to high-quality clinical management. In this Personal View, we explore how social and commercial determinants of health shape environments that promote the development and progression of MASLD. We also examine how stigma acts as an underestimated barrier, contributing to diagnostic delays and impaired quality of life in people with MASLD. Based on an integrative perspective, we propose a comprehensive and multisectoral approach for the sustainable management of MASLD.}

abstract = {Background
When selecting clinical predictive tools, clinicians are challenged with an overwhelming and ever-growing number, most of which have never been implemented or evaluated for effectiveness. The authors developed an evidence-based framework for grading and assessment of predictive tools (GRASP). The objective of this study is to refine, validate GRASP, and assess its reliability for consistent application.
Methods
A mixed-methods study was conducted, involving an initial web-based survey for feedback from a wide group of international experts in clinical prediction to refine the GRASP framework, followed by reliability testing with two independent researchers assessing eight predictive tools. The survey involved 81 experts who rated agreement with the framework's criteria on a five-point Likert scale and provided qualitative feedback. The reliability of the GRASP framework was evaluated through interrater reliability testing using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Results
The survey yielded strong agreement of the experts with the framework's evaluation criteria, overall average score: 4.35/5, highlighting the importance of predictive performance, usability, potential effect, and post-implementation impact in grading clinical predictive tools. Qualitative feedback led to significant refinements, including detailed categorisation of evidence levels and clearer representation of evaluation criteria. Interrater reliability testing showed high agreement between researchers and authors (0.994) and among researchers (0.988), indicating strong consistency in tool grading.
Conclusion
The GRASP framework provides a high-level, evidence-based, and comprehensive, yet simple and feasible, approach to evaluate, compare, and select the best clinical predictive tools, with strong expert agreement and high interrater reliability. It assists clinicians in selecting effective tools by grading them on the level of validation of predictive performance before implementation, usability and potential effect during planning for implementation, and post-implementation impact on healthcare processes and clinical outcomes. Future studies should focus on the framework's application in clinical settings and its impact on decision-making and guideline development.}

However, the mechanisms underlying the achievement of flow experience in this context remain underexplored. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study investigates how GAI-IDLE influences flow experience through the lens of three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Specifically, we aim to examine the mediating effects of these psychological needs on the relationship between GAI-IDLE and flow experience. To achieve this, we conducted a survey among 333 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners from various colleges in China. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with Smart PLS 4.0 software, our results show that GenAI literacy and English proficiency positively and directly impacted flow experience, while gender had no direct effect. GAI-IDLE directly predicted flow experience and positively influenced autonomy and relatedness, which in turn directly enhanced flow experience. Thus, GAI-IDLE indirectly affected flow experience through the mediation of autonomy and relatedness. However, contrary to SDT, GAI-IDLE did not directly affect competence, and competence did not directly influence flow experience, resulting in an insignificant mediating role for competence. We discuss potential explanations for these findings and conclude with educational implications.}

abstract = {Introduction
Refractory foot ulcers, characterized by prolonged healing and frequent recurrences, challenge existing therapies such as revascularization and compression, which typically fail to prevent amputation. We developed adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell line-derived platelet-like cells (ASCL-PLCs) for refractory ulcers that are long-lasting and readily available.
Methods
A translational preclinical investigation and phase 1/2a first-in-human clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel allogeneic ASCL-PLC treatment for refractory foot ulcers. In the pre-clinical phase, ASCL-PLCs were cryopreserved for 9 months and then thawed to measure cytokine release after calcium chloride stimulation. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a diabetic mouse wound model, comparing ASCL-PLC treatment with vehicle control. The clinical trial involved topically applying ASCL-PLCs (1.5 × 108 cells/cm2) to the ulcers of four patients (two ischemic, two venous) on days 0, 14, and 28, with safety and efficacy monitored based on adverse events, ulcer size reduction, epithelialization time, and pain score changes.
Results
ASCL-PLCs maintained considerable cytokine-releasing activity even after long-term cryopreservation. In the diabetic mouse skin defect model, treatment with ASCL-PLCs substantially enhanced wound closure compared with the controls, demonstrating potent wound-healing capabilities. In the clinical trial, all patients exhibited notable ulcer size reduction without serious adverse events; three achieved epithelialization within 6 months, along with improvements in pain and quality of life without a negative impact on local blood flow.
Conclusions
ASCL-PLCs are safe and a promising therapeutic option for refractory ulcers and can potentially reduce amputation rates, improve patient outcomes, and minimize the socioeconomic impact due to chronic wounds. Their long shelf life and cryopreservation stability make wound management practical and accessible. Moreover, their efficacy with simple topical application suggests a minimally invasive strategy suitable for outpatient care. Further large-scale trials are recommended.

abstract = {Background
The management of fracture-related infection has undergone radical progress following the development of international guidelines. However, there is limited consideration to the realities of healthcare in low-resource environments due to a lack of available evidence in the literature from these settings. Initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture union is frequently used in low- and middle-income countries despite the lack of published clinical evidence to support its practice. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes following initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture union in the management of fracture-related infection.
Methods
A retrospective review of consecutive patients treated with initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture healing followed by definitive eradication surgery to manage fracture-related infections following intramedullary fixation was performed. Indications for this approach were; a soft tissue envelope not requiring reconstructive surgery, radiographic evidence of stable fixation with adequate alignment, and progression towards fracture union.
Results
This approach was associated with successful treatment in 51/55 (93 %) patients. Fracture union was achieved in 52/55 (95 %) patients with antimicrobial suppression alone. Remission of infection was achieved in 54/55 (98 %) patients following definitive infection eradication surgery. Following antibiotic suppression, 6/46 (13 %) pathogens isolated from intra-operative samples demonstrated multi-drug resistance.
Conclusion
Initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture healing followed by definitive infection eradication surgery was associated with successful treatment in 93 % of patients. The likelihood of remission of infection increases when eradication surgery is performed in a healed bone. This approach was not associated with an increased risk of developing multi-drug-resistant infections compared to contemporary bone infection cohorts in the published literature.

Despite the existence of robust legal instruments, a persistent gap remains between legal norms and their effective implementation, resulting in ongoing harm to children. The article highlights how international law not only prohibits acts such as killing, maiming, and attacks on schools and hospitals but also mandates obligations for recovery, reintegration, and access to health and education—implicitly addressing the psycho-physical harm children endure. Arguing that legal understanding must extend beyond legal professionals to include healthcare providers, the article calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to protect children more effectively.

abstract = {Objectives
Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS), secondary to various underlying diseases, is one of the main causes of intestinal failure in children. Surgical management by serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP), is feasible in selected cases, but results on long-term follow-up are scarce. The aim of this study was to report long-term outcomes of the STEP procedure in children with SBS.
Methods
We performed a multicenter national retrospective study reviewing medical charts of children who underwent a STEP technique between 2000 and 2022 in 6 university hospitals. Collected data included demographics, SBS history, surgical procedures, nutritional support (enteral or parenteral), STEP management, complications, and outcomes (nutritional support, digestive symptoms, growth).
Results
STEP was performed in 36 SBS, resulting from 14 gastroschisis, 10 intestinal atresia, 8 necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), 2 midgut volvulus, and 2 intestinal Hirschsprung disease. Median age at first STEP was 10.8 months [4.5; 63.8]. Bowel length significantly increased (47 vs 70 cm, p < 0.01), with a median gain of 16 cm [11; 25] or 34%. At surgery, 33 children had parenteral nutrition (PN). A second STEP was performed in 11 patients, at a median age of 4.2 years [2.8; 6.8]. One patient underwent a third STEP. Two children required intestinal transplantation. Median follow-up was 7 years [4.4;11.4]. Out of 33 children requiring PN before surgery, 14 children were weaned off PN. The remaining 19 children still required PN, but their dependency decreased by 19%. Out of 17 children presenting severe intestinal dilations and bacterial overgrowth, 12 became asymptomatic. Out of 20 with chronic obstructive symptoms, 8 patients still required supplementary PN whereas 12 achieved complete enteral autonomy, including 3 requiring supplementary enteral support.
Conclusion
STEP technique remains a surgical option in the management of these children, enabling a decrease in PN dependency, resulting in weaning off PN in some cases, as well as an improvement of clinical symptoms.

This study seeks to address these issues by exploiting a privacy by design architectural solution that utilises the fully local deployment of open-source LMs. Specifically, to mitigate any risk of information leakage, we focus on evaluating the performance of open-source language models (SLMs) that can be deployed on personal devices, such as smartphones or laptops, without stringent hardware requirements. We assess the effectiveness of this solution adopting hypertension management as a case study. Models are evaluated across various tasks, including intent recognition and empathetic conversation, using Gemini Pro 1.5 as a benchmark. The results indicate that, for certain tasks such as intent recognition, Gemini outperforms other models. However, by employing the “large language model (LLM) as a judge” approach for semantic evaluation of response correctness, we found several models that demonstrate a close alignment with the ground truth. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of locally deployed SLMs as components of medical chatbots, while addressing critical concerns related to privacy and reliability.}

abstract = {Purpose
To identify the potential target genes of blast lung injury (BLI) for the diagnosis and treatment.
Methods
This is an experimental study. The BLI models in rats and goats were established by conducting a fuel-air explosive power test in an unobstructed environment, which was subsequently validated through hematoxylin-eosin staining. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on lung tissues from both goats and rats. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the criteria of q ≤ 0.05 and |log2 fold change| ≥ 1. Following that, enrichment analyses were conducted for gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. The potential target genes were further confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Observations through microscopy unveiled the presence of reddish edema fluid, erythrocytes, and instances of focal or patchy bleeding within the alveolar cavity. Transcriptome sequencing analysis identified a total of 83 differentially expressed genes in both rats and goats. Notably, 49 genes exhibited a consistent expression pattern, with 38 genes displaying up-regulation and 11 genes demonstrating down-regulation. Enrichment analysis highlighted the potential involvement of the interleukin-17 signaling pathway and vascular smooth muscle contraction pathway in the underlying mechanism of BLI. Furthermore, the experimental findings in both goats and rats demonstrated a strong association between BLI and several key genes, including anterior gradient 2, ankyrin repeat domain 65, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family A member 1, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family B member 1, and keratin 4, which exhibited up-regulation.
Conclusions
Anterior gradient 2, ankyrin repeat domain 65, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family A member 1, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family B member 1, and keratin 4 hold potential as target genes for the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of BLI.}

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has driven the digitalization and intelligence of spectral analysis. However, the complexity of environmental samples and spectral overlap remain a major challenge. This study proposes a multi-component HM detection method that integrates ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) superimposed spectra with deep learning to address the issue of spectral overlap. By using combinatorial chemical probes to enhance the specificity of colorimetric reactions and conducting high-throughput experiments to collect spectra, a Transformer model is trained to extract qualitative and quantitative information in an end-to-end manner. During the method development phase, the model was trained using five representative HMs (Sb, Fe, Ni, Cd, Cu) to verify its recognition ability under complex conditions (average R² = 0.936, RMSE = 0.132 mg L−1, MAE = 0.054 mg L−1). The method was then extended to detect ten HMs in real-world samples, demonstrating its scalability and robustness (average R² = 0.681, RMSE = 0.189 mg L−1). These results show that the method can simultaneously analyze multiple HMs and transition from spectral fingerprints to quantified ecological risk profiles. Additionally, the AI analysis software developed in this study automates the entire process from spectral input to multi-index detection and risk assessment, providing environmental regulatory authorities with minute-level response capabilities and facilitating proactive early warning for HM pollution control.}

Herein, we report a transmetalation strategy to induce desired metal exchange frustrated flexibility defects in a prototypical MOF platform. Specifically, the pristine Zn-based MOF undergoes selective Zn-to-Mn exchange through a carefully controlled solvothermal transmetalation process. This protocol generates a series of Mn-doped MOFs with increasing Mn integration and the concomitant formation of defect sites within the framework. Detailed structural characterization confirms the successful Mn doping and illuminates the generation of vacancies and distortions around the exchanged Mn nodes. The transmetallated Mn-doped MOF materials exhibit altered chemical environments, as probed by spectroscopic techniques, and display promising sensing activity for NOx through the MOF matrix membrane. The proposed application of the MOF samples as an adsorbent-based chemical sensor includes sensing mechanisms for NO2 gas.}

As a widely used method for teaching, dialogic pedagogy is important for orchestrating productive educational achievement. However, it is challenging to manipulate such pedagogy and thus there is the need for scalable professional development. This study initially incorporated a customised IMRT, which supports teachers to communicate with a virtual administrator, to generate comments and refinements for classroom dialogue in an immersive and tangible way. A quasi-experiment was conducted with 60 primary school teachers to test its effectiveness. This study discovered that teachers participating in the IMRT-based training tended to exhibit greater self-efficacy in enhancing dialogic pedagogy compared to those who engaged in traditional training methods. Furthermore, these teachers' practical competencies concerning dialogic pedagogy increased dramatically. Specifically, they gained greater proficiency in managing elaborated, coordinated, and speculative talk. Under their skilful initiation of dialogue, students were more inclined to justify ideas, seek connections, explore possibilities, and engage in constructive conversations. Moreover, findings indicated that more positive correlations between teachers’ self-efficacy and their actual practice in the IMRT-based training group, especially with regard to dialogues involving complex ways of thinking. This study offers valuable insights for technological integration and pedagogical improvement. It contributes to the viability of scalable teacher training and to helping in-service teachers with their professional growth.}

The difference in immunity of these two animals might be an obstacle to successful vaccine development. The protective immunity induced by LigAc was reported to be specific antibodies while T-cell-mediated immunity has never been investigated. We reported for the first time that hamsters and mice gave dissimilar T-cell responses. Mice and hamsters were divided into 3 groups: an adjuvant plus recombinant LigAc (rLigAc) immunized, an adjuvant-injected, and a negative control group. Immunizations were done three times at 2-week intervals. The rLigAc-specific IgG antibody titers in rLigAc immunized mice and hamsters were significantly higher than in the control groups but no significant difference between the animals. The percentages of hamster CD4+ T cells were significantly higher than those of mice. Mouse CD25+CD4+ T cells responded to rLigAc significantly higher than hamsters. Interestingly, the rLigAc significantly reduced the percentage of IFN-γ+CD4+ cells in mice (≅30 %) and more decrease (≅70 %) was found in hamsters. Remarkably, it also reduced considerably hamster IL-4+CD4+ T cells (≅80 %) but an extremely low decrease in mice (≅20 %).

abstract = {Background
This paper describes the adaptation of an evidence-based intervention for mental health, Self-Help Plus (SH+), to a digital platform, aiming to expand mental health support through innovative technological solutions. The SH+ intervention, designed by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a low-intensity, self-guided program aimed at improving mental well-being. The intervention has been integrated into a chatbot-driven mobile app called “ALBA” (Automated Well-Being Assistant).
Objective
This protocol describes the stages of transition (porting) from a traditional face-to-face, group-based approach to a tech-enabled model, tailored specifically for women with breast cancer and pregnant women. The adaptation of this approach is described, focusing on 2 key aspects: (1) the shift from in-person delivery to a tech-enabled intervention and (2) the customization of the intervention to address the unique needs of the selected target groups.
Methods
The development of the ALBA app involved a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach combining expertise in psychology, eHealth IT, interaction design, and specific domain knowledge related to pregnancy and oncology. The development process followed 2 primary methodologies: user-centered design and service design. These approaches emphasize understanding user needs, promoting iterative improvements, and continuously incorporating user feedback. The development followed the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model, which involves a cycle of literature review, stakeholder consultation, content development, software development, and evaluation. At the same time, specific attention was dedicated to (1) adapting the SH+ protocol to suit the chatbot-driven ALBA platform, (2) tailoring content to the target population, and (3) incorporating interactive features to improve engagement and potential efficacy.
Results
The manuscript outlines the key steps and processes involved in adapting the SH+ intervention into the ALBA digital platform. This includes an overview of the challenges and opportunities of translating a face-to-face, group-based intervention into a tech-enabled model and provides insight into how customization for specific populations, such as women with breast cancer and pregnant women, was integrated into the design of the platform. This is in view of informing future studies on the development and adaptation of already validated protocols into mobile health (mHealth) interventions in the field of mental health and mental well-being.
Conclusions
The digital adaptation of the SH+ intervention into the ALBA platform could represent a significant step forward in expanding the accessibility and personalization of mental health interventions in potentially different settings and target groups. The use of virtual coaching applications can play a central role in improving the availability and ease of access of psychological support, even in different and mHealth formats. Future developments could include further testing in real-world settings to expand (1) adaptations for various target groups and (2) the purpose of use to range from primary prevention to more clinically focused interventions.

The Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA)
Study focus
TGRA faces increasing vulnerability to extreme precipitation events driven by complex convective weather systems. Radar echo extrapolation—predicting future precipitation patterns from current radar data—is essential for early warning systems but faces significant challenges in this topographically complex region. While data-driven approaches have advanced the field, current convolutional neural network-based diffusion models struggle with the TGRA's dynamic meteorological conditions due to their reliance on translational invariance, which often fails to capture rapid weather transitions in complex terrain.
New hydrogeological insights from the region
To address these limitations, we introduce RadarDiT, a Vision Transformer-based diffusion model specifically engineered for radar extrapolation in the TGRA. First, we develop a five-year radar dataset capturing diverse convective weather phenomena unique to this region. Then, leveraging this dataset, RadarDiT employs multi-layer Vision Transformers that effectively model global dependencies and complex spatial relationships, enabling accurate prediction of convective cell evolution. Our model demonstrates superior performance in maintaining strong echo and spatial coherence over longer forecast horizons. Quantitative evaluations across multiple metrics and thresholds confirm RadarDiT's enhanced skill in forecasting heavy precipitation events, with particular improvements in Critical Success Index at higher radar echo values. This work establishes a foundation for more reliable nowcasting systems in regions with complex terrain and dynamic weather patterns, directly supporting enhanced disaster preparedness and response strategies.}

abstract = {Background
Patients increasingly have direct access to their medical record. Radiology reports are complex and difficult for patients to understand and contextualize. One solution is to use large language models (LLMs) to translate reports into patient-accessible language. Objective This review summarizes the existing literature on using LLMs for the simplification of patient radiology reports. We also propose guidelines for best practices in future studies.
Evidence Acquisition
A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Studies published and indexed using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to February 2025 were included. Inclusion criteria comprised of studies that used large language models for simplification of diagnostic or interventional radiology reports for patients and evaluated readability. Exclusion criteria included non-English manuscripts, abstracts, conference presentations, review articles, retracted articles, and studies that did not focus on report simplification. The Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) 2018 was used for bias assessment. Given the diversity of results, studies were categorized based on reporting methods, and qualitative and quantitative findings were presented to summarize key insights.
Evidence Synthesis
A total of 2126 citations were identified and 17 were included in the qualitative analysis. 71% of studies utilized a single LLM, while 29% of studies utilized multiple LLMs. The most prevalent LLMs included ChatGPT, Google Bard/Gemini, Bing Chat, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot. All studies that assessed quantitative readability metrics (n=12) reported improvements. Assessment of simplified reports via qualitative methods demonstrated varied results with physician vs non-physician raters.
Conclusion and Clinical Impact
LLMs demonstrate the potential to enhance the accessibility of radiology reports for patients, but the literature is limited by heterogeneity of inputs, models, and evaluation metrics across existing studies. We propose a set of best practice guidelines to standardize future LLM research.}

Training generative AI models carries the risk of copyright infringement. How can we balance the development of generative AI technology with copyright protection during the training stage of these models? In contrast to existing legal scholarship, this article conducts a comparative study of industry-oriented U.S. copyright law and rights-oriented EU copyright law. It draws insights from the concepts of the tragedy of the commons and the tragedy of the anti-commons, proposing the creation of fair remuneration rights for Generative AI training under the UN's international governance regime for AI. This article offers a typological analysis of potential operational models for fair remuneration rights in Generative AI training, drawing analogies to existing remuneration rights in international copyright treaties. The goal is to provide an open framework for further discussion within the international academic community.}

keywords = {GPT-4.0, LLMs, Neurosurgery, Consultation},
abstract = {Background
Although prior work demonstrated the surprising accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) on neurosurgery board-style questions, their use in day-to-day clinical situations warrants further investigation. This study assessed GPT-4.0′s responses to common clinical questions across various subspecialties of neurosurgery.
Methods
A panel of attending neurosurgeons formulated 35 general neurosurgical questions spanning neuro-oncology, spine, vascular, functional, pediatrics, and trauma. All questions were input into GPT-4.0 with a prespecified, standard prompt. Responses were evaluated by two attending neurosurgeons, each on a standardized scale for accuracy, safety, and helpfulness. Citations were indexed and evaluated against identifiable database references.
Results
GPT-4.0 responses were consistent with current medical guidelines and accounted for recent advances in the field 92.8 % and 78.6 % of the time respectively. Neurosurgeons reported GPT-4.0 responses providing unrealistic information or potentially risky information 14.3 % and 7.1 % of the time respectively. Assessed on 5-point scales, responses suggested that GPT-4.0 was clinically useful (4.0 ± 0.6), relevant (4.7 ± 0.3), and coherent (4.9 ± 0.2). The depth of clinical responses varied (3.7 ± 0.6), and “red flag” symptoms were missed 7.1 % of the time. Moreover, GPT-4.0 cited 86 references (2.46 citations per answer), of which only 50 % were deemed valid, and 77.1 % of responses contained at least one inappropriate citation.
Conclusion
Current general LLM technology can offer generally accurate, safe, and helpful neurosurgical information, but may not fully evaluate medical literature or recent field advances. Citation generation and usage remains unreliable. As this technology becomes more ubiquitous, clinicians will need to exercise caution when dealing with it in practice.}

Traditional strategies for this include surface modification of vascular devices through covalent attachment of substrates such as heparin, antiplatelet agents, thrombolytic agents, or hydrophilic polymers. One promising prosthetic material is polyether ether ketone (PEEK), which is utilized in various FDA-approved medical devices, including vascular and endovascular prostheses. We hypothesized that surface modification of biologically inert PEEK can help improve its endothelial cell affinity and reduce its thrombogenic potential. To evaluate this, we developed an effective surface-modification approach with unique cyclic peptides, such as CCHGGVRLYC and CCREDVC. We treated the PEEK surface with ammonia plasma, which introduced amine groups onto the PEEK surface. Subsequently, we were able to conjugate these peptides to the plasma-modified PEEKs. We observed that cyclic CCHGGVRLYC conjugated on prosthetic PEEK not only supported endothelialization, but minimized platelet adhesion and activation. This technology can be potentially applied for in vivo vascular and endovascular protheses to enhance their utility and patency.}

abstract = {Background
Hepatitis A outbreaks in the United Kingdom are uncommon. Most people develop mild to moderate symptoms that resolve, without sequelae, within months. However, in high-risk groups, including those with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD), hepatitis A infection can be severe, with a higher risk of mortality and morbidity. The Health Security Agency and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommend preexposure hepatitis A vaccination given in 2 doses to people with CLD, regardless of its cause. There are currently no published reports of vaccination coverage for people with CLD in England or internationally.
Objective
This study aims to describe hepatitis A vaccination coverage in adults with CLD in a UK primary care setting and compare liver disease etiology, sociodemographic characteristics, and comorbidities in people who are and are not exposed to the hepatitis A vaccine.
Methods
We will conduct a retrospective cohort study with data from the Primary Care Sentinel Cohort of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub database, which is nationally representative of the English population. We will include people aged 18 years and older who have been registered in general practices in the Research and Surveillance Centre network and have a record of CLD between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2022, including those with alcohol-related liver disease, chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, nonalcohol fatty liver disease, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. We will carefully curate variables using the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms. We will report the sociodemographic characteristics of those who are vaccinated. These include age, gender, ethnicity, population density, region, socioeconomic status (measured using the index of multiple deprivation), obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage for 1 and 2 doses will be calculated using an estimate of the CLD population as the denominator. We will analyze the baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics, including measures of dispersion. Pairwise comparisons of case-mix characteristics, comorbidities, and complications will be reported according to vaccination status. A multistate survival model will be fitted to estimate the transition probabilities among four states: (1) diagnosed with CLD, (2) first dose of hepatitis A vaccination, (3) second dose of hepatitis A vaccination, and (4) death. This will identify any potential disparities in how people with CLD get vaccinated.
Results
The Research and Surveillance Centre population comprises over 8 million people. The reported incidence of CLD is 20.7 cases per 100,000. International estimates of hepatitis A vaccine coverage vary between 10% and 50% in this group.
Conclusions
This study will describe the uptake of the hepatitis A vaccine in people with CLD and report any disparities or differences in the characteristics of the vaccinated population.

By harnessing mechanical energy and converting it into electrical energy, TENGs enable the development of self-powered sensors suitable for environmental applications. In this context, A nitrogen-rich polymer organic framework (POF) was synthesized based on porphine using pyrrole and tested its effectiveness in a TENG. The POF particles are used as the positive triboelectric layer and FEP as the negative triboelectric layer in the TENG fabrication process. The resulting POF-based TENG could generate 70 V voltage, 1.2 µA of current, and 5 µW of power. We also demonstrated that the TENG could charge capacitors and power LEDs. The study explored the operational mechanism of the TENG in harsh environmental conditions and how the POF material detects pH changes, confirming its efficiency in pH sensing. The research highlights the synthesis of the POF material, its use as a triboelectric layer, the fabrication process of the TENG, and its performance in energy harvesting and self-powered applications.}

IC refers to an individual's physical and mental abilities (including five dimensions: sensory, psychology, locomotion, vitality and cognition), which support the maintenance of functional capacity and promote healthy aging. In this review, we aimed to describe the prevalence of IC decline in LBD and its potential consequences. While few studies focused specifically on this question, we found evidence in the literature of a higher prevalence of IC decline in LBD, compared to cognitively unimpaired older adults and to Alzheimer’s disease patients. If future studies are needed to confirm these results, we assume that IC assessment and monitoring in LBD may be a further step towards a better integrated and personalized care for patients. This may open the avenue to develop specific tailored interventions, to decrease disability and increase quality of life and “healthy ageing” of patients despite the presence of LBD.}

Introduction
There is currently no clear consensus on the standards for using large language models such as ChatGPT in academic medicine. Hence, we performed a scoping review of available literature to understand the current state of LLM use in medicine and to provide a guideline for future utilization in academia.
Materials and methods
A scoping review of the literature was performed through a Medline search on February 16, 2023 using a combination of keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, generative pre-trained transformer, ChatGPT, and large language model. There were no restrictions to language or date of publication. Records not pertaining to LLMs were excluded. Records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT were identified and evaluated separately. Among the records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT, those that suggest recommendations for ChatGPT use in academia were utilized to create guideline statements for ChatGPT and LLM use in academic medicine.
Results
A total of 87 records were identified. 30 records were not pertaining to large language models and were excluded. 54 records underwent a full-text review for evaluation. There were 33 records related to LLM ChatBots or ChatGPT.
Discussion
From assessing these texts, five guideline statements for LLM use was developed: (1) ChatGPT/LLM cannot be cited as an author in scientific manuscripts; (2) If use of ChatGPT/LLM are considered for use in academic work, author(s) should have at least a basic understanding of what ChatGPT/LLM is; (3) Do not use ChatGPT/LLM to produce entirety of text in manuscripts; humans must be held accountable for use of ChatGPT/LLM and contents created by ChatGPT/LLM should be meticulously verified by humans; (4) ChatGPT/LLMs may be used for editing and refining of text; (5) Any use of ChatGPT/LLM should be transparent and should be clearly outlined in scientific manuscripts and acknowledged.
Conclusion
Future authors should remain mindful of the potential impact their academic work may have on healthcare and continue to uphold the highest ethical standards and integrity when utilizing ChatGPT/LLM.}

In this study, we assessed the composition and diversity of macrobenthic communities at ten different sites in the Jianjiang River estuary reserve in both Spring and Autumn and used three biotic indices to evaluate the ecological quality status (EcoQs) across the reserve. We identified 58 macrobenthic taxa, of which the largest proportion were Mollusca (48.28 %), followed by Annelida (27.59 %) and Arthropoda (18.97 %). Macrobenthic abundance and biomass varied among sites and seasons, and community composition was driven by different environmental variables in Spring and Autumn. With respect to our three indices of ecological quality, abundance-biomass comparison (ABC) curve analysis and the associated W-statistics indicated that macrobenthic communities in the reserve were undisturbed in the Spring but disturbed in Autumn. The AZTI marine biotic index (AMBI) indicated that most sites have high or good EcoQs, with higher EcoQs in the Spring, and the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) index similarly suggested that the average EcoQs were good in Spring but only moderate in Autumn. We suspect that the consistently lower EcoQs in Autumn across all sites were largely due to a 1-in-10-year flood discharge that occurred during our sampling year and disturbed sites near the river outflow. Overall, our results point towards specific, scientifically informed suggestions for future management of the Jianjiang River estuary reserve.}

abstract = {Background
The accumulation of vast electronic medical records (EMRs) through medical informatization creates significant research value, particularly in obstetrics. Diagnostic standardization across different health care institutions and regions is vital for medical data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for various medical tasks. Prompt engineering is key to use LLMs effectively.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of LLMs with various prompt engineering techniques on the task of standardizing obstetric diagnostic terminology using real-world obstetric data.
Methods
The paper describes a 4-step approach used for mapping diagnoses in electronic medical records to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, observation domain. First, similarity measures were used for mapping the diagnoses. Second, candidate mapping terms were collected based on similarity scores above a threshold, to be used as the training data set. For generating optimal mapping terms, we used two LLMs (ChatGLM2 and Qwen-14B-Chat [QWEN]) for zero-shot learning in step 3. Finally, a performance comparison was conducted by using 3 pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERTs), including BERT, whole word masking BERT, and momentum contrastive learning with BERT (MC-BERT), for unsupervised optimal mapping term generation in the fourth step.
Results
LLMs and BERT demonstrated comparable performance at their respective optimal levels. LLMs showed clear advantages in terms of performance and efficiency in unsupervised settings. Interestingly, the performance of the LLMs varied significantly across different prompt engineering setups. For instance, when applying the self-consistency approach in QWEN, the F1-score improved by 5%, with precision increasing by 7.9%, outperforming the zero-shot method. Likewise, ChatGLM2 delivered similar rates of accurately generated responses. During the analysis, the BERT series served as a comparative model with comparable results. Among the 3 models, MC-BERT demonstrated the highest level of performance. However, the differences among the versions of BERT in this study were relatively insignificant.
Conclusions
After applying LLMs to standardize diagnoses and designing 4 different prompts, we compared the results to those generated by the BERT model. Our findings indicate that QWEN prompts largely outperformed the other prompts, with precision comparable to that of the BERT model. These results demonstrate the potential of unsupervised approaches in improving the efficiency of aligning diagnostic terms in daily research and uncovering hidden information values in patient data.}

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has seen widespread application in many fields. However, the emergence of adversarial examples has revealed a critical vulnerability, making them susceptible to potential attacks. Although numerous adversarial attack methods have been proposed, they are often constrained by certain constraints. Most current adversarial attack methods are based on addition of perturbations, which are confined to clean examples and fail to generate diverse and natural adversarial examples. Moreover, owing to the additional perturbations, these methods exhibit limited robustness against adversarial defenses, such as image denoising. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposed a three-stage attack framework based on an adversarial diffusion model, named AT-Diff (Adversarial Transfer on Diffusion model). Firstly, to address the issue of inadequate robustness in traditional adversarial examples, we utilize a diffusion model to learn the adversarial example distribution of the target model and generate highly realistic adversarial examples from scratch without any additional perturbations, thereby significantly enhancing their performance under defense measures. Additionally, we design a Temporal Adaptive Loss (TAL) function, which dynamically adjusts the visual loss and the adversarial loss according to the current time step, ensuring that the generated adversarial examples gradually enhance their adversarial efficacy while maintaining high visual quality. Extensive experiments conducted on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have shown that our method attains noteworthy results in imperceptibility, while also exhibiting stronger robustness.}

abstract = {Background
Fusion genes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study investigated the utility of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of ribonucleic acid (RNA) for detecting rare and unknown fusion genes in patients with AML.
Methods
A total of 85 adult AML samples previously identified as fusion gene-negative by multiplex nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were subjected to NGS analysis.
Results
Fusion genes were detected in 21 of 72 (29.2%) patients. Among the 26 primary refractory patients, 11 (42.3%) exhibited fusion genes, whereas among the 18 relapsed patients, fusion genes were identified in five (27.8%). Notably, KMT2A and NUP98 rearrangements were enriched in refractory/relapsed patients. Additionally, recurrent fusion transcripts involving EIF4A1 were observed. The identification of additional fusion genes resulted in an approximate 20.8% (11/53) reclassification of medium-risk karyotypes to the poor-risk category, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
Conclusions
Targeted NGS may complement conventional methods for identifying novel fusions in refractory/relapsed AML; however, its prognostic utility requires verification in controlled trials.}

keywords = {Tumor-associated macrophages, Macrophage activation, Tumor microenvironment, Molecular docking simulation},
abstract = {Background
Resting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are stimulated by the tumor microenvironment and can be primarily polarized into two subtypes: M1- and M2-like. M1-like TAMs promote inflammation and eradicate tumor cells, whereas M2-like TAMs suppress inflammation and facilitate tumor development. However, the mechanisms underlying phenotypic switching in these macrophages remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the gene expression profiles of M1-like and M2-like TAMs in pan cancers.
Methods
Three computational methods were used to estimate the infiltration score of TAMs in 9239 tumor samples across 31 solid cancer types, based on RNA sequencing databases. Tumor samples were divided into high- and low-score groups based on the median M1/M2 ratio. Furthermore, gene enrichment, protein interactions, and transcription factors were analyzed. Multiple pharmaco-omics profiles were used to identify potential drugs. Finally, binding between the compounds and drug targets was validated using molecular docking.
Results
Of the top 100 dysregulated genes in each cancer type, 70 and 82 genes with upregulated and downregulated expression, respectively, were consistently differentially expressed. We identified candidate drugs targeting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a core protein. These included efaproxiral, hesperidin, ezetimibe, calcitriol, and linopirdine.
Conclusions
This study provides a pan-cancer characterization of the TAM polarization-related gene profile. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses revealed five promising therapeutic agents for TAM reprogramming. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the enhancement of immune responses to inhibit tumor immune escape and metastasis.}

abstract = {Background
Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a critical competency in critical care training, yet standardized methods for assessing MV-related knowledge are lacking. Traditional multiple-choice question (MCQ) development is resource-intensive, and prior studies have suggested that generative AI tools could streamline question creation. However, the quality of AI-generated MCQs remains unclear.
Research Question
Are MCQs generated by ChatGPT non-inferior to human-expert (HE) created questions in terms of quality and relevance for MV education.
Study Design and Methods
Three key MV topics were selected: Equation of Motion & Ohm’s Law, Tau & Auto PEEP, and Oxygenation. Fifteen learning objectives were used to generate 15 AI-written MCQs via a standardized prompt with ChatGPT (model o1-preview-2024-09-12). A group of 31 faculty experts, all of whom regularly teach MV, evaluated both AI-generated and HE-generated MCQs. Each MCQ was assessed based on its alignment with learning objectives, accuracy of chosen answer, clarity of stem, plausibility of distractors, and difficulty level. The faculty members were blinded to the provenance of the MCQ questions. The non-inferiority margin was predefined as 15% of the total possible score (-3.45).
Results
AI-generated MCQs were statistically non-inferior to expert-written MCQs (95% upper CI: [-1.15, ∞]). Additionally, respondents were unable to reliably differentiate AI-generated from HE-written MCQs (p = 0.32).
Interpretation
AI-generated MCQs using ChatGPT o1 are comparable in quality to those written by human experts. Given the time and resource-intensive nature of human MCQ development, AI-assisted question generation may serve as an efficient and scalable alternative for medical education assessment, even in highly specialized domains such as mechanical ventilation.

abstract = {Background
The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, particularly ChatGPT with GPT-4 (OpenAI), in assisting with medical diagnosis is an emerging research area. However, it is not yet clear how well AI chatbots can evaluate whether the final diagnosis is included in differential diagnosis lists.
Objective
This study aims to assess the capability of GPT-4 in identifying the final diagnosis from differential-diagnosis lists and to compare its performance with that of physicians for case report series.
Methods
We used a database of differential-diagnosis lists from case reports in the American Journal of Case Reports, corresponding to final diagnoses. These lists were generated by 3 AI systems: GPT-4, Google Bard (currently Google Gemini), and Large Language Models by Meta AI 2 (LLaMA2). The primary outcome was focused on whether GPT-4’s evaluations identified the final diagnosis within these lists. None of these AIs received additional medical training or reinforcement. For comparison, 2 independent physicians also evaluated the lists, with any inconsistencies resolved by another physician.
Results
The 3 AIs generated a total of 1176 differential diagnosis lists from 392 case descriptions. GPT-4’s evaluations concurred with those of the physicians in 966 out of 1176 lists (82.1%). The Cohen κ coefficient was 0.63 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), indicating a fair to good agreement between GPT-4 and the physicians’ evaluations.
Conclusions
GPT-4 demonstrated a fair to good agreement in identifying the final diagnosis from differential-diagnosis lists, comparable to physicians for case report series. Its ability to compare differential diagnosis lists with final diagnoses suggests its potential to aid clinical decision-making support through diagnostic feedback. While GPT-4 showed a fair to good agreement for evaluation, its application in real-world scenarios and further validation in diverse clinical environments are essential to fully understand its utility in the diagnostic process.}

abstract = {Background
Simulated electronic health records (EHRs) are used in structured teaching for health care students. This partly addresses inconsistent student exposure to EHRs while on clinical placements. However, simulated records are poor replacements for the complexity of data encountered in real EHRs. While routinely collected health care data are often used for research, secondary use does not include education. We are exploring the perceptions, governance, and ethics required to support the use of real patient records within teaching.
Objective
The aim of the study is to explore the perspectives of health care professionals regarding the use of real patient records to deliver interprofessional EHR education to undergraduate health care students.
Methods
We held 90-minute group discussions with 10 health care professionals from nursing, pharmacy, medicine, and allied health disciplines. We used the GRIPP2 (Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public 2) checklist for reporting Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement to present our reflections.
Results
There was consensus on the need to upskill health care students in the use of EHRs. Participants emphasized teaching general EHR competencies and transferable skills to overcome the diversity in EHR systems. They highlighted limitations in current teaching due to accessibility issues, disparities within clinical teaching, and curricular gaps on important topics such as clinical documentation and coding. Highlighted benefits of using real EHRs in teaching included learning from the complexities and inaccuracies of real patient data, grasping real-world time frames, and better appreciation of multidisciplinary interactions. Concerns included exposing individual clinicians to unfounded scrutiny and the potential consequences of incidental findings within EHRs. The ethical implications of overlooking perceived errors within EHRs versus the impracticality of acting on them were discussed. To mitigate concerns, it was suggested that data donors would provide informed consent ensuring they understand that they will not be recontacted should any such errors be found.
Conclusions
Innovative solutions are needed to realign health care education with clinical practice in rapidly evolving digital environments. Real patient records are optimal for teaching students to handle complex and abundant real-world data. Data within EHRs represent a wealth of clinical knowledge encompassing professional and personal experiences spanning the lifetimes of patients and their caregivers. Drawing experiences and events from real EHRs will prepare health care students to anticipate, confront, and manage real patients in a variety of real-life scenarios. Our reflections highlight the processes and safeguards to consider when using real patient records to deliver EHR education to health care students. These detailed reflections from discussions with health care professionals provide the grounds for a robust framework, with appropriate governance and consent in place to use real health data in training to support preparation for clinical practice.}

The application of large language models (LLMs) in analyzing expert textual online data is a topic of growing importance in computational linguistics and qualitative research within health care settings.
Objective
The objective of this study was to understand how LLMs can help analyze expert textual data. Topic modeling enables scaling the thematic analysis of content of a large corpus of data, but it still requires interpretation. We investigate the use of LLMs to help researchers scale this interpretation.
Methods
The primary methodological phases of this project were (1) collecting data representing posts to an online nurse forum, as well as cleaning and preprocessing the data; (2) using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to derive topics; (3) using human categorization for topic modeling; and (4) using LLMs to complement and scale the interpretation of thematic analysis. The purpose is to compare the outcomes of human interpretation with those derived from LLMs.
Results
There is substantial agreement (247/310, 80%) between LLM and human interpretation. For two-thirds of the topics, human evaluation and LLMs agree on alignment and convergence of themes. Furthermore, LLM subthemes offer depth of analysis within LDA topics, providing detailed explanations that align with and build upon established human themes. Nonetheless, LLMs identify coherence and complementarity where human evaluation does not.
Conclusions
LLMs enable the automation of the interpretation task in qualitative research. There are challenges in the use of LLMs for evaluation of the resulting themes.}

Key distinctions between NP and VAP are explored in terms of microbiological profiles, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic implications. The review provides a detailed analysis of risk factors for MDROs – including prolonged mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic exposure, and host-related immunosuppression – emphasizing the importance of risk stratification in guiding empirical antibiotic selection. A critical appraisal of international guideline recommendations (IDSA/ATS, ERS, SEPAR) highlights areas of consensus and divergence, particularly regarding empirical treatment strategies and the role of narrow- versus broad-spectrum coverage. The integration of rapid molecular diagnostic tools, such as multiplex PCR, is discussed in depth, including their potential to improve diagnostic yield, facilitate early de-escalation, and enhance antimicrobial stewardship. Recent advances in antimicrobial development are reviewed, covering novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and siderophore cephalosporins with activity against ESBL−, KPC−, and carbapenemase-producing pathogens.

Synthetic biology revolutionizes our ability to decode and recode genetic systems. The capability to reconstruct and flexibly manipulate multi-gene systems is critical for understanding cellular behaviors and has significant applications in therapeutics.
Objectives
This study aims to construct a diverse library of synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) to enable flexible control of multi-gene expression in mammalian cells.
Methods
We designed and constructed synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) that incorporate both a universal activation site (UAS) and a specific activation site (SAS), enabling multi-level expression control via the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system. To evaluate promoter activity, we utilized Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) to assess the basal strengths of the STPs and their activation responses. Next, we constructed a three-gene reporter system to assess the capacity of the synthetic promoters for achieving multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems.
Results
The promoter library contains 24,960 unique non-redundant promoters with distinct sequence characteristics. MPRA revealed a wide range of promoter activities, showing different basal strengths and distinct activation levels when activated by the CRISPRa system. When regulated by targeting the SAS, the STPs exhibited orthogonality, allowing multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems without cross-interference. Furthermore, the combinatorial activation of STPs in a multi-gene system enlarged the scope of expression levels achievable, providing fine-tuned control over gene expression.
Conclusion
We provide a diverse collection of synthetic tunable promoters, offering a valuable toolkit for the construction and manipulation of multi-gene systems in mammalian cells, with applications in gene therapy and biotechnology.}

We use transformer-based models (GPT-4, LLAMA3, and Mistral) to create our synthetic dataset in French. These models generate a diverse range of descriptions that capture the variability of ME types. We assess the effectiveness of our synthetic dataset through expert evaluations by healthcare professionals and an AI-driven analysis, to test its realism and its utility in training machine learning models for ME classification.
Results:
The synthetic dataset demonstrates high accuracy and realism in representing diverse ME scenarios. Expert evaluation confirms that the dataset is similar to real-world ME data. The AI-driven evaluation also shows that models trained on synthetic data achieved robust classification performance, validating the dataset’s utility for the development of effective ME classification tools.
Conclusion:
The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of large language models to generate realistic synthetic ME reports in French. Out of 200 evaluated reports, 70% of zero-shot outputs were deemed below expectations, while 80% of one-shot and few-shot outputs were considered valid or valid with minor revisions by clinical experts. Furthermore, classifiers trained on 800 synthetic reports attained an F1-score of up to 0.78 when tested on real data. These results confirm that synthetic data can effectively support AI-driven ME analysis in contexts where real-world data is limited or unavailable.}

abstract = {Several strategies have emerged lately in response to the rapid increase in the aging population to enhance health and life span and manage aging challenges. Developing such strategies is imperative and requires an assessment of biological aging. Several aging clocks have recently been developed to measure biological aging and to assess the efficacy of longevity interventions. Biological age better reflects a person’s actual age and is closely associated with health outcomes and time to mortality. Traditionally, most aging clocks assume that biological changes occur linearly over time. However, age-related changes do not necessarily follow a linear trajectory. Thus, “Deep Aging Clocks” have been developed to overcome previous clocks' limitations and better capture subtle changes that occur during aging. Here, we summarize the current deep aging clocks, including epigenetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and imaging based clocks for age prediction. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing deep learning techniques, have significantly enhanced the prediction of biological aging, and this would help improve aging clocks and accelerate efforts to reach longer and healthier lives.}

abstract = {Background
Rapid on-site detection of infectious diseases is considerably essential for preventing and controlling major epidemics and maintaining social and public safety. However, the complexity of the natural environment in which infectious disease pathogens exist severely disrupts the performance of on-site detection, and rapid detection can become meaningless because of the cumbersome sample pretreatment process.
Result
Herein, a new detection platform based on a carbon sphere@Fe3O4 micromotor (CS@Fe3O4) in combination with a graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) was designed and used for the on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pathogens. The CS@Fe3O4 micromotor, surface-modified with anti-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibody, could move at a velocity of 79.4 μm/s in a solution containing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and exhibited capture rates of 67.9% and 36.2% for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and soil solutions, respectively. After magnetic field separation, the captured micromotor was used for GFET detection, with detection limits of 4.6 and 15.6 ag/mL in PBS and soil solutions, respectively.
Significance and novelty
This detection platform can be employed to avoid complex sample pretreatment procedures and achieve rapid on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pathogens in complex environments. This study introduces a novel approach for the on-site detection of infectious diseases.}

Digital tools could assist obstetric providers by delivering information given increasing options for fetal aneuploidy screening.
Purpose
To determine the impact of a chatbot for pre-test education and counseling in low-risk pregnancies.
Methods
Two sites participated in this randomized controlled trial. Patients in the intervention group used a chatbot prior to the provider visit, while patients in the control group only received education by the provider. The primary outcome was change in patient knowledge scores after provider education. Analysis was by intention to treat.
Results
Overall, 258 women participated (n = 130; intervention and n = 128; control). Knowledge gain was significantly higher among patients using the chatbot (mean increase in correct answers [out of 20]: +4.1 vs +1.9, p < 0.001). Both groups reported high satisfaction, with no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups (mean patient satisfaction [1–10]: 8.2 vs 8.5 respectively, p = 0.35). Providers also reported high satisfaction scores with no significant difference between intervention and control groups (mean provider satisfaction [1 − 10]: 8.7 vs 8.4 respectively, p = 0.13).
Conclusions
Pre-test education via a chatbot can increase patient knowledge of prenatal testing choices, with high patient and provider satisfaction.}

However, the factors that lead athletes to start using illegal substances are less known. The gateway to doping hypothesis posits that widespread dietary supplement usage among athletes could potentially desensitise them, increasing the inclination towards doping use. To examine this hypothesis, the personality structure of athletes using dietary supplements for diverse motives is examined, aiming to identify patterns indicative of doping propensity, including dark traits, perfectionism, ego and task orientation and attitude towards doping. The final sample comprises 687 athletes (479 women; mean age = 26.06 ± 9.21 years). The findings suggest that the overall use and frequency of dietary supplement intake are not significantly predicted by personality traits indicative of a predisposition towards doping. While athletes that use supplements to enhance performance, regeneration, and body shape display a slightly more favourable attitude towards doping, dark traits exhibit an inverse link across all motives (except body shape enhancement) with substantial effect sizes. Although doping usage is not assessed in this study, the outcomes indicate that personality structures associated with doping do not predict dietary supplement use, thus challenging the gateway to doping hypothesis.}

The concept of a medical “digital twin” has recently become popular to designate digital representations of patients as a support for a wide range of data science applications. However, the concept is ambiguous when it comes to practical implementations. Here, we propose a medical digital twin framework with a data-centric approach. We argue that a single digital representation of patients cannot support all the data uses of digital twins for technical and regulatory reasons. Instead, we propose a data architecture leveraging three main families of digital representations: (1) multimodal dashboards integrating various raw health records at points of care to assist with perception and documentation, (2) virtual patients, which provide nonsensitive data for collective secondary uses, and (3) individual predictions that support clinical decisions. For a given patient, multiple digital representations may be generated according to the different clinical pathways the patient goes through, each tailored to balance the trade-offs associated with the respective intended uses. Therefore, our proposed framework conceives the medical digital twin as a data architecture leveraging several digital representations of patients along clinical pathways.}

abstract = {Background
While the advantages of using the internet and social media for research recruitment are well documented, the evolving online environment also enhances motivations for misrepresentation to receive incentives or to “troll” research studies. Such fraudulent assaults can compromise data integrity, with substantial losses in project time; money; and especially for vulnerable populations, research trust. With the rapid advent of new technology and ever-evolving social media platforms, it has become easier for misrepresentation to occur within online data collection. This perpetuation can occur by bots or individuals with malintent, but careful planning can help aid in filtering out fraudulent data.
Objective
Using an example with urban American Indian and Alaska Native young women, this paper aims to describe PRIOR (Protocol for Increasing Data Integrity in Online Research), which is a 2-step integration protocol for combating fraudulent participation in online survey research.
Methods
From February 2019 to August 2020, we recruited participants for formative research preparatory to an online randomized control trial of a preconceptual health program. First, we described our initial protocol for preventing fraudulent participation, which proved to be unsuccessful. Then, we described modifications we made in May 2020 to improve the protocol performance and the creation of PRIOR. Changes included transferring data collection platforms, collecting embedded geospatial variables, enabling timing features within the screening survey, creating URL links for each method or platform of data collection, and manually confirming potentially eligible participants’ identifying information.
Results
Before the implementation of PRIOR, the project experienced substantial fraudulent attempts at study enrollment, with less than 1% (n=6) of 1300 screened participants being identified as truly eligible. With the modified protocol, of the 461 individuals who completed a screening survey, 381 did not meet the eligibility criteria assessed on the survey. Of the 80 that did, 25 (31%) were identified as ineligible via PRIOR. A total of 55 (69%) were identified as eligible and verified in the protocol and were enrolled in the formative study.
Conclusions
Fraudulent surveys compromise study integrity, validity of the data, and trust among participant populations. They also deplete scarce research resources including respondent compensation and personnel time. Our approach of PRIOR to prevent online misrepresentation in data was successful. This paper reviews key elements regarding fraudulent data participation in online research and demonstrates why enhanced protocols to prevent fraudulent data collection are crucial for building trust with vulnerable populations.

Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a common surgical substrate in adult epilepsy surgery cohorts but variably reported in various pediatric cohorts.
Objective
We aimed to study the epilepsy phenotype, radiological and pathological variability, seizure and neurocognitive outcomes in children with drug-resistant epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) with or without additional subtle signal changes in anterior temporal lobe who underwent surgery.
Methods
This retrospective study enrolled children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis with or without additional subtle T2-Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAR)/Proton Density (PD) signal changes in anterior temporal lobe who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy. Their clinical, EEG, neuropsychological, radiological and pathological data were reviewed and summarized.
Results
Thirty-six eligible patients were identified. The mean age at seizure onset was 3.7 years; 25% had daily seizures at time of surgery. Isolated HS was noted in 22 (61.1%) cases and additional subtle signal changes in ipsilateral temporal lobe in 14 (38.9%) cases. Compared to the normative population, the group mean performance in intellectual functioning and most auditory and visual memory tasks were significantly lower than the normative sample. The mean age at surgery was 12.3 years; 22 patients (61.1%) had left hemispheric surgeries. ILAE class 1 outcomes was seen in 28 (77.8%) patients after a mean follow up duration of 2.3 years. Hippocampal sclerosis was noted pathologically in 32 (88.9%) cases; type 2 (54.5%) was predominant subtype where further classification was possible. Additional pathological abnormalities were seen in 11 cases (30.6%); these had had similar rates of seizure freedom as compared to children with isolated hippocampal sclerosis/gliosis (63.6% vs 84%, p=0.21). Significant reliable changes were observed across auditory and visual memory tasks at an individual level post surgery.
Conclusions
Favourable seizure outcomes were seen in most children with isolated radiological hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with additional pathological abnormalities had similar rates of seizure freedom as compared to children with isolated hippocampal sclerosis/gliosis.}

abstract = {Objectives
In field hockey, there is limited information regarding lower extremity (LE) injury prevention screening protocols. To help inform the design of field hockey LE injury prevention screening protocols, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether static and dynamic single-leg balance (SLB), single-leg hop (SLH), and agility running tasks with unilateral limb-loading bias capture similar or different aspects of LE motor performance.
Design
Cross-sectional.
Setting
Indoor training facility.
Participants
Thirty adult female players.
Main outcome measures
For the right and left LE, Pearson's correlations (r) and the coefficient of determination (r2) assessed between-task relationships and shared variance, respectively, for: eyes-closed SLB, Star Excursion Balance Test – anterior reach, triple-hop-for-distance, 6-m-hop-for-time, modified pro-agility test.
Results
Across all correlations, 50% were not statistically-significant. Statistically-significant (P < 0.05) relationships were returned for the right LE (r = −0.69 to 0.42, r2 = 0.17 to 0.48) and left LE (r = −0.62 to 0.53, r2 = 0.17 to 0.38). Overall, between-task shared variance was ≤48.0%.
Conclusions
Because between-task shared variance was ≤48.0%, static and dynamic SLB, SLH, and agility running tasks with unilateral limb-loading bias each assess different aspects of LE motor performance. Therefore, practitioners should incorporate a range of LE motor performance tasks when designing field hockey LE injury prevention screening protocols.}

Recent studies have shown a growing concern regarding the cost-effectiveness and the lack of supporting data for the biologic agents that are being increasingly used in the orthopedic field. Our aim was to conduct a systematic scoping review of recent publications (last five years) on the use of orthobiologics to treat fracture non-union and summarize the latest available data.
Patients and methods
The inclusion criteria for this review were articles published in English, from 2016 to 2022, and focusing on the use of orthobiologics for the surgical treatment of non-union. Searches were conducted in March 2023 using Pubmed/MEDLINE and Embase. Studies on spinal fusion or gene therapy were excluded. Reviews, case reports with five cases or less, conference proceedings, preliminary reports, pediatric or non-human studies were excluded as well.
Results
The search found 1807 articles, 15 were eligible after PRISMA checklist and exclusions. The evidence was heterogenous and there was only one level II RCT. Recent data suggests that bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2) products could be effective for septic and aseptic tibial non-unions. However, the evidence was not conclusive regarding BMP-7, plasma rich platelets (PRP), stem cells or demineralized bone matrix (DBM).
Discussion
Every non-union case is different in terms of bone defect, biology, mechanical stability, surgical technique and host factors, which contributes to the conflicting reports on the efficacy of orthobiologics in the literature. We might never see a level 1, high powered and robust study defining the efficacy, safety profile and cost-effectiveness of such products.

abstract = {Background
The Patient Protection US Affordable Care Act (ACA) energy posting mandate requires restaurant chains to disclose information on the energy content of their food items. Assessments of the effect of menu energy labeling on dietary choices have reported inconsistent findings.
Objectives
This study examined the impact of menu energy labeling on food items purchased by college students after the mandate was enacted nationally.
Methods
Student food sales data from purchases made at 3 fast-food restaurants during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years at a university campus were used for the analysis. The total sample included 1662 students on the university meal plan; these students generated 145,295 food transactions at the restaurants over the study period. We utilized a difference-in-differences (DiD) empirical strategy, comparing changes in transaction-level energy purchases at 2 fast-food restaurants B and C (FFRB and FFRC – treatment groups) that posted energy information in the summer of 2018 with another fast-food restaurant A (FFRA – control group) that began posting energy information before the study period.
Results
We observed increases in the mean energy content per transaction after implementing the menu-labeling policy. The DiD estimates found an increase of 20.6 in the mean calories of energy purchased per transaction at the treatment restaurants relative to the control restaurant. In the subgroup analyses, the DiD estimates indicated calories of energy increased: 18.7 for female students, 20.5 for male students, 23.5 for non-Hispanic Black students, 30.2 for students eligible for federal financial aid, and 19.9 for students not eligible for federal financial aid.
Conclusions
The results suggest that the ACA energy menu-labeling policy led to an increase in the energy content per transaction by students at a public university. This paper highlights the need for more research to better understand the determinants of food choice among college students.}

Medical education has responded to this shift with calls for improved digital health training, but there is as yet no universal understanding of the needed competencies, domains, and best practices for teaching these skills. In this paper, we argue that a “digital determinants of health” (DDoH) framework for understanding the intersections of health outcomes, technology, and training is critical to the development of comprehensive digital health competencies in medical education. Much like current social determinants of health models, the DDoH framework can be integrated into undergraduate, graduate, and professional education to guide training interventions as well as competency development and evaluation. We provide possible approaches to integrating this framework into training programs and explore priorities for future research in digitally-competent medical education.}

Road safety offences are the most prevalent in Spain. Although the most serious offences carry prison sentences, the vast majority of road offences are associated with alternative penalties, such as the community service order, where the perpetrators serve their sentences mainly in workshops for reintegration and road re-education, known as TASEVAL. The purpose of this research is to identify which are the most common criminal behaviours behind the wheel and to determine the direction in which recidivism is heading in order to provide valid information with which to improve the existing correctional programmes employed in Spain and, in turn, in other countries. Our findings are based on a sample of 20,260 TASEVAL road safety training course attendees and their recidivism over the following four years. The principal takeaway was that the most common and concerning repeated behaviours are related to driving under the effects of alcohol or drugs and driving without a licence, establishing clear criminal pattern, with the latter being the most frequent type of recidivism. It is of utmost importance to understand the reasons for these recidivist profiles so that reintegration measures can be targeted directly at the source of the problem and thus be more effective, which will help to minimise both recidivism and the number of road crashes.}

abstract = {Objective
Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) in medicine has become a prominent topic of discussion due to the rapid improvement of these tools in understanding and responding to natural language. Several models are widely available to the public, both proprietary and open-sourced. We aim to evaluate the possible use of such LLMs in vascular surgery by understanding their abilities to process common consult requests.
Methods
The senior author created 25 fictional vascular surgery consultation queries based on common consultation requests. Five attending surgeons and four LLMs (GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Bard, and Falcon 40B) were asked to answer whether each consult was an emergency that needed immediate attention within an hour. Responders were also asked whether the next best step was an examination, additional imaging, or an urgent operation. GPT 3.5 and 4 also provided free-response answers on the next best step, graded by attending surgeons based on scientific accuracy, possible harm, and content completeness.
Results
The rates of accurate emergency identification were 88%, 100%, 76%, and 88% for GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Falcon 40B, and Bard, respectively. Although they have similar overall accuracy, GPT 3.5 has a high sensitivity at 100%, whereas Bard has a high specificity at 90%. GPT 4.0 had 100% sensitivity and specificity. LLMs agreed with the majority surgeon opinion on the next best step in 64% (GPT 3.5), 32% (GPT 4), 68% (Falcon 40B), and 36% (Bard) of cases. GPT 3.5 and 4 had a collective ratio of 89.5% of answers adhering to the scientific consensus. Only 5% of responses were highly likely to cause clinically significant harm. Although only 4% included incorrect content, 17.5% of answers missed important content. There was no significant difference between GPT 3.5 and 4 regarding the free-response grade.
Conclusions
Existing, widely available LLMs exhibited a solid ability to identify vascular emergencies, with GPT 4.0 agreeing with surgeon attendings in 100% of cases. However, these models continue to have identifiable deficiencies in treatment recommendations, a higher-level task. Future models might help triage incoming consults and provide preliminary management suggestions. The utility of such tools in clinical practice remains to be explored.}

abstract = {In recent times, the growth in compact and inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and lightweight imaging sensors has led to an interest in utilizing them in different remote sensing applications. In UAV aerial imagery, acquiring meaningful image representations plays a crucial role in scene classification. Prior techniques to the scene classification procedure rely on feature coding techniques with lower-level unsupervised feature learning or hand-engineered features. As the number of UAVs improves, clustering is important and required to give scalability because clustering systems guarantee the primary level of system performance like energy efficiency (EE). Recently, deep learning (DL) has depended on methods that is used for scene classification models captured by UAVs. In this manuscript, an Energy-Aware Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Assisted Mobile Multimedia Communication via Metaheuristic Optimization (EAUAV-MCMO) technique is proposed. The major intention of the EAUAV-MCMO technique is to present an effective model for energy-aware dynamic resource allocation in UAV networks using advanced techniques. Initially, the chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) model is used for clustering process which comprises five cluster fitness functions (FF) such as intra-cluster distance, UAV nodes, cluster node (CN) density, distance from CHs to sink, and EE. For scene classification, the VGG16 technique is employed for feature extraction. Furthermore, the stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) technique is implemented for classification. Finally, the slime mold algorithm (SMA) adjusts the parameter tuning of the SDAE technique and results in superior classification results. The efficacy of the EAUAV-MCMO approach is examined under the UC Merced Land Use dataset. The comparison study of the EAUAV-MCMO approach illustrated a superior accuracy value of 99.37 % over existing methods.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in most countries; however, few specific political actions have been implemented to improve cardiovascular health at both national and international levels. We aimed to describe the methodology used for the development and initial rollout of Spain's Cardiovascular Health Strategy of the National Health System (ESCAV, Estrategia en Salud Cardiovascular del Sistema Nacional de Salud).
Methods
A multidisciplinary team comprising diverse stakeholders developed a national strategy to reduce the burden of CVD in Spain. The team used qualitative methodologies to identify and select priorities and design strategic map models.
Results
The strategy was structured around a matrix with 6 cross-cutting themes (citizen empowerment; health promotion, prevention, and early CVD detection; comprehensive management of acute and chronic CVD; health care coordination; equity; and knowledge management) and 4 longitudinal lines (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and valve disease). The framework was further supported by 3 overarching axes: continuity of care, patient safety, and leveraging of information systems. A total of 27 critical points were selected, leading to the definition of 99 strategic objectives (32 general and 67 specific) and 136 actions through iterative reviews and prioritization. Strategic maps were developed for the overall strategy and for each action line, incorporating 61 indicators to facilitate and monitor the development of the strategy.
Conclusions
ESCAV represents one of the most ambitious initiatives aimed at transforming a nation's cardiovascular health. The methods and steps undertaken in this process could serve as a valuable reference for other countries seeking to establish similar initiatives. Furthermore, it may act as a catalyst to advance efforts toward establishing a European plan for cardiovascular health.

abstract = {Background
Healthcare data volume is increasingly expanding, presenting both challenges and opportunities. Traditional statistical methods applied in epidemiology, such as logistic regression (LR), albeit widely used, holds limited ability to handle the complexity and high dimensionality of modern datasets. In contrast, machine learning (ML) methods can model complex, non-linear relationships and are less constrained by parametric assumptions, ideal for uncovering hidden patterns.
Methods
In this study, we aim to introduce ML applications for epidemiologic research and explore three predictive models: LR as a traditional modeling approach, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as ML approaches. We demonstrate how ML approaches, particularly XGBoost, can benefit epidemiologic research through a real-world case study. We present common steps: data preprocessing, model creation and evaluation processes. Additionally, we address the "black box" nature of ML models and present post hoc explanation tools to enhance interpretability.
Results
We examined the case of near-centenarianism (reaching age of 95 years or older) prediction using midlife predictors (i.e., demographic, clinical, lifestyle, occupational and dietary variables) in a cohort of approximately 10,000 middle-aged working men recruited in 1963 and followed until death or until 2019. Models were fitted and calibrated on a training set, showing good predictive performances on a separate test set. XGboost, LASSO regression, and LR achieved ROC-AUC values of 0.72 (95 % CI: 0.66–0.75), 0.71 (95 % CI: 0.67–0.74) and 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.66–0.73), respectively. Explainability analysis identified key predictors for longevity, including systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and a history of myocardial infarction; consistent with prior studies.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of ML to enhance epidemiological studies by handling complex interactions and high-dimensional data, suggesting a complementary approach to traditional methods.}

abstract = {Background:
Data sharing in healthcare is vital for advancing research and personalized medicine. However, the process is hindered by privacy, ethical, and legal challenges associated with patient data. Synthetic data generation emerges as a promising solution, replicating statistical properties of real data while enhancing privacy protection.
Methods:
This systematic review examines deep learning techniques for synthetic data generation in healthcare, focusing on their ability to maintain data utility and enhance privacy. Studies from Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and IEEE databases published between 2019 and 2023 were analyzed. Key methods explored include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models. Evaluation metrics encompass data resemblance, utility, and privacy preservation, with special attention to privacy-enhancing methods like differential privacy and federated learning.
Results:
GANs and VAEs demonstrated robust capabilities in generating realistic synthetic data for tabular, signal, image, and multi-modal datasets. Privacy-preserving approaches such as differential privacy and adversarial training significantly reduced re-identification risks while maintaining data fidelity. However, challenges persist in preserving temporal correlations, reducing biases, and aligning with regulatory frameworks, particularly for longitudinal and high-dimensional data.
Conclusion:
Synthetic data generation holds significant potential for privacy-preserving data sharing in healthcare. Ongoing research is required to develop advanced algorithms and evaluation frameworks, ensuring synthetic data’s quality and privacy. Collaboration between technologists and policymakers is essential to create comprehensive guidelines, fostering secure and effective data sharing in healthcare.}

Academic literature about transportation for adults with disabilities skews toward walking, driving one’s own motor vehicle, using a ridehailing or taxi service, using a carsharing service as a driver, and using public transit, so this review focuses primarily but not exclusively on those modes. We frame these problems using the terms that we introduced in a previous work. Provider-view availability refers to where & when a transportation mode is present or legal to use. Immediate usability refers to features of a mode’s vehicles or infrastructure, where and when such vehicles and infrastructure are present, that help or hurt a user. User-view availability captures how serious problems with immediate usability for some users can prevent them from using those modes at all, make some aspects of provider-view availability moot for them. Cumulative usability refers to problems with a mode that arise over frequent use, longer trips, or more complicated trips, that may discourage a user from using that mode. We explain how modes that have similar requirements, present or absent, for the user to drive or to make a first-/last-mile connection exhibit consequently similar problems with provider-view availability, immediate usability, user-view availability, and cumulative usability.}

This is the first confirmed use of microstructural polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel in dielectric layers and the first example of casting in the fabrication of capacitive sensors. Notably, on account of its flexibility, the sensor also addresses the problem of microstructure fracture and misalignment during sensor bending. These sensors can achieve a maximum sensitivity of 1.34 kPa−1 (under 10 kPa) with a fast response time (50 ms), good cyclic stability (> 1000 cycles), and a wide pressure sensing range (0 ∼ 290 kPa).

abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning (DL) in medical imaging for improving clinical procedures related to the mandibular third molar (MM3).
Methods
Our systematic search included databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, up to April 10, 2024. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the potential bias and clinical relevance of the studies. To examine the interaction between MM3 and the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), we conducted a meta-analysis using a bivariate mixed-effects model to compare the performance of DL methods with that of human experts.
Results
In this comprehensive review, a total of 33 scholarly works involving 45,029 imaging instances were analyzed. Among these, 15 studies specifically focused on evaluating the performance of DL methods in identifying the spatial relationship between MM3 and IAN. The aggregated results showed that DL achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.93) and a specificity of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.93). In parallel, a comparative meta-analysis that included assessments from 16 clinical experts revealed slightly lower sensitivity (0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.85) and specificity (0.86; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94). Additionally, the review explored the utility of DL in predictive modeling of MM3 eruption, assessing the complexity of extraction procedures, and identifying MM3 characteristics. The 18 studies in this area demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity ranging from 0.80 to 0.94 and specificity from 0.75 to 0.97, collectively highlighting the strong prognostic capabilities of DL in these clinical applications.
Conclusions
DL has demonstrated remarkable efficacy, especially in precisely identifying the anatomical connections between MM3 and IAN. Moreover, DL excels in identifying, categorizing, and assessing the complexity associated with MM3 extractions. This study confirms the substantial value of DL, particularly when utilized through image-based methods, in improving clinical management strategies for MM3. The creation of intelligent diagnostic tools using oral panoramic radiographs (OPGs) is strongly encouraged to assist physicians, especially those with limited clinical experience, in enhancing their diagnostic accuracy. These advancements in DL applications are expected to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical diagnoses in oral and maxillofacial surgeries.}

Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of the early use of high efficacy therapies (HETs) with the effectiveness of moderate efficacy therapies (METs) in children with MS.
Methods
This observational study included patients diagnosed with pediatric MS, at 4 hospital centers in France, during a 10-year period. METs included: interferon β-1a, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide; HETs included: fingolimod, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a new relapse, the secondary endpoint was EDSS worsening.
Results
Sixty-four patients were included in the analysis (80% women; mean age 15.5 years, 81% treated with MET) with a median follow-up of 22.5 months. At baseline, 52 patients were on MET (interferon β-1a, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide) and 12 patients were on HET (natalizumab, ocrelizumab). The cumulative probability of being relapse-free at 6.5 years was 23.3% on MET, vs 90.9% on HET (p = 0.013). The cumulative probability of no EDSS worsening did not differ between the 2 groups.
Conclusion
Patients starting with METs had much higher clinical disease activity than those starting early with HETs. Rapid initiation of more aggressive treatment may allow better disease control; however, the data on EDSS worsening are not conclusive.}

abstract = {Background
Many patients with unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) access health care in emergency departments (EDs). Scalable supports, such as SMS text messaging interventions, are acceptable and feasible to enhance care delivery for many health issues, including substance use. Further, SMS text messaging interventions have been shown to improve patient outcomes related to alcohol consumption (eg, reduced consumption compared to no intervention, basic health information, or drink tracking), but they are rarely offered in clinical settings.
Objective
This paper describes a mixed methods study using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. The goal of this study was to use a stakeholder-engaged mixed methods design to assess barriers and facilitators to the implementation of SMS text messaging interventions for UAU in EDs with a focus on the recipient’s characteristics, the innovation’s degree of fit within the existing practice, and the unique nature of the inner and outer context.
Methods
This study was conducted in a large health system in the northeastern United States. We examined electronic health record data on alcohol screening in 17 EDs; surveyed 26 ED physician chairpersons on implementation feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness; and interviewed 18 ED staff and 21 patients to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation. Interviews were analyzed according to the i-PARIHS framework to assess recipient characteristics, innovation degree of fit, and inner and outer context.
Results
Electronic health record data revealed high variability in alcohol screening completion (mean 73%, range 35%‐93%), indicating potential issues in identifying patients eligible to offer the intervention. The 26 ED chair surveys revealed a relatively high level of implementation confidence (mean 4, SD 0.81), acceptability (mean 4, SD 0.71), and appropriateness (mean 3.75, SD 0.69) regarding the UAU SMS text messaging intervention; feasibility (mean 3.5, SD 0.55) had the lowest mean, indicating concerns about integrating the text intervention in the busy ED workflow. Staff were concerned about staff buy-in and adding additional discussion points to already overwhelmed patients during their ED visit but saw the need for additional low-threshold services for UAU. Patients were interested in the intervention to address drinking and health-related goals.
Conclusions
ED visits involving UAU have increased in the United States. The results of this formative study on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of UAU SMS text messaging interventions in EDs indicate both promise and caution. In general, we found that staff viewed offering such interventions as appropriate and acceptable; however, there were concerns with feasibility (eg, low alcohol risk screening rates). Patients also generally viewed the SMS text messaging intervention positively, with limited drawbacks (eg, slight concerns about having time to read messages). The results provide information that can be used to develop implementation strategies that can be tested in future studies.

abstract = {The performance of a spiral-wound reverse osmosis (RO) membrane system, operating in a cyclic mode of normal feed flow (NFF)-feed flow reversal (FFR), was evaluated for desalting feed water of high gypsum mineral scaling potential. The membrane system, with six membrane elements in series, was operated without antiscalant dosing at the condition of gypsum supersaturation at the membrane surface of the tail RO element. Automated NFF/FFR switching was triggered by an optical membrane monitoring system (MMS) installed at the last membrane element. This element alternated from being the tail to lead element at NFF and FFR modes, respectively. Multicycle NFF/FFR operation demonstrated partial cycle-to-cycle restoration of the permeate flux. However, progressive flux decline was noticeable with increased NFF/FFR cycles. Complete restoration of element productivity (in terms of permeate flux) was attained via permeate flushing (at the early membrane scaling stage) owing to gypsum scale dissolution. The study results suggest that NFF/FFR RO operation under conditions of high mineral scaling potential can be effectively combined with periodic permeate flushing. However, establishing the long-term approach feasibility will require a strategy for optimizing the frequency of NFF/FFR switching and permeate flushing in relation to the feed water quality and desalting operating conditions.}

However, existing studies often predict target text components monolithically, neglecting the benefits of utilizing single elements for tuple prediction. In this paper, we introduce Element to Tuple Prompting (E2TP), employing a two-step architecture. The former step focuses on predicting single elements, while the latter step completes the process by mapping these predicted elements to their corresponding tuples. E2TP is inspired by human problem-solving, breaking down tasks into manageable parts, using the first step’s output as a guide in the second step. Within this strategy, three types of paradigms, namely E2TP(diet), E2TP(f1), and E2TP(f2), are designed to facilitate the training process. Beyond dataset-specific experiments, our paper addresses cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach. By conducting a comprehensive analysis across 10 different datasets for dataset-specific experiments, as well as 6 different states for cross-domain experiments, we show that E2TP achieves new state-of-the-art results in nearly all cases in terms of the F1 score evaluation metric.11Code and data released at https://github.com/mghiasvand1/E2TP}

abstract = {Generalized Image Extrapolation is an image generation sub-task and a challenging ill-posed problem. This task intends to predict unknown regions based on the center area. Unfortunately, existing methods encounter the triple dilemma: (1) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based methods can precisely extract local details but underperform in capturing global semantic information due to inductive bias, resulting in a lack of consistency in the image structure and layout. (2) Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods, although superior to global information extraction, are not sufficiently fine-grained in detail and texture generation, and (3) ViT-based approaches rely on the self-attention mechanism, which leads to a tremendous computational burden in processing images and makes model training inefficient. We propose a novel model named Mamba-GIE, designed to effectively balance information of different granularities and address the unresolved challenges in GIE tasks. At the macro level, Mamba-GIE adopts a U-shaped encoder–decoder architecture, with its core basic block being the improved Hybrid State Space Models (Hybrid-SSMs). Specifically, within the basic blocks, the input feature map is processed via two parallel branches: (1) Extracting global information via the Mamba branch and (2) Handling local details using the CNNs branch. At the micro level, we introduce the dual-level adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve adaptive feature fusion in intra- and inter-Hybrid-SSMs blocks. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing GIE methods in most evaluation metrics and image generation quality. Comprehensive ablation studies and resource consumption assessments further reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of Mamba-GIE. Code: https://github.com/zrymsm/Mamba-GIE.}

Accurately estimating the number of these pests is crucial for ensuring the safety of grain storage and enabling effective management. However, most existing methods are limited to a single visual modality and rely heavily on manual annotations, making it difficult to achieve accurate counting in dense scenes. To explore the potential of multi-modal information in stored-grain pest analysis, this study introduces a multi-modal learning paradigm into this domain and proposes a multi-modal network for stored-grain pest counting. Our approach firstly leverages task-specific prompts and a modified image encoder to enhance counting performance. Then, a mean-interval counting strategy is applied to retain the discreteness of the counting values. Finally, a novel Location- Aware Cross-Entropy (LACE) loss function to achieve more accurate pest density estimation. We evaluate our experiments based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Experimental results on our various pests dataset demonstrate that our method achieves the optimal performance, with the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as low as 1.88 and 3.34, respectively. Compared with the state of the art counting methods, these two values are reduced by 1.12 and 1.23 points, respectively.}

abstract = {Background
Despite a recent Cochrane Review demonstrating blunt suture needles are safer for surgeons, the use of blunt suture needles has not become widely adopted. In the ‘Implant Era’, with the value of medical implant companies to surpass $145 billion by 2027, should we re-examine the use of blunt suture needles, especially to reduce infection in implant surgery? We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing whether blunt suture needles reduce risks to surgeons and patients.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed per PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE databases were searched for RCTs. Dichotomous variables were pooled as risk ratios (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the MH method. Random or fixed effects modelling use was based on statistical heterogeneity (I2).
Results
14 RCTs were identified with 2488 patients. The RCTs included laparotomies, caesarean sections, episiotomies, and orthopaedic surgeries. Blunt suture needles when compared with sharp needles resulted in a significant reduction in glove perforation; RR: 0.47, 95% CI [0.37 to 0.60] and needlestick injuries, RR: 0.50, 95% CI [0.26 to 0.97]. Sharp needles caused more wound infections, but the result was not statistically significant; RR: 2.73, 95% CI [0.54 to 13.76], p 0.22. Surgeon's satisfaction decreased with blunt needles compared with sharp (RR: 1.22, 95% CI [1.09 to 1.37]).
Conclusion
Blunt suture needles are safer than sharp needles for surgeons and likely reduce risks to patients. This, however, comes at the cost of decreased ease of use. The authors recommend the routine use of blunt suture needles, especially in implant surgery.}

abstract = {Social media is used to promote the HPV vaccine through various strategies, including the use of stories and narratives. Understanding the ethical concerns related to the use of social media in this capacity are important. The purpose of this study is to identify ethical concerns of using fictional stories to share information and emotions about the HPV vaccine on social media, ultimately to influence parents on their decision to vaccinate their child. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with researchers in the fields of health communication, cancer prevention, social media, and public health ethics from October to December 2021. Respondents were presented with a fictional story that consisted of seven connected vignettes about the HPV vaccine. For each vignette, respondents were asked to rate the potential benefits and risk, as well as the potential for ethical concerns of using the fictional narrative style to share information about the HPV vaccine. Descriptive statistics summarized responses, and qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results: On average, respondents (n = 41) perceived more benefits than risks when it comes to 1) using social media for health education generally and 2) using a story with connected vignettes for vaccine communication. The vignettes prioritizing vaccine hesitancy, positive emotion, and health equity were seen as having the most potential benefit, while the vignettes highlighting vaccine confidence and skepticism were seen as having the most potential risk. Overall, respondents felt there were several ethical concerns of note – persuasion was the most common (15 % of respondents) followed by deception (9 %) and manipulation (8 %). Qualitative data highlighted the importance of transparency and trust to avoid ethical violations and negative outcomes. Conclusions: Ethical concerns exist when using fictional stories to share health information on social media, particularly as new online technologies make it harder to tell fact from fiction. Practical and actionable recommendations for researchers must be developed, defining a range of ethical responsibilities.}
