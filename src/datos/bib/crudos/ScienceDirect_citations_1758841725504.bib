abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are being rapidly adopted for many activities in organizations, business, and education. Included in their applications are capabilities to generate text, code, and models. This leads to questions about their potential role in the conceptual modeling part of information systems development. This paper reports on a panel presented at the 43rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling where researchers discussed the current and potential role of LLMs in conceptual modeling. The panelists discussed applications and interest levels and expressed both optimism and caution in the adoption of LLMs. Suggested is a need for much continued research by the conceptual modeling community on LLM development and their role in research and teaching.}

abstract = {The widespread use of AI-generated photos in marketing raises concerns about authenticity, trust, and misinformation. Addressing these challenges requires understanding the differences between AI-generated and human-captured (real) photos and developing effective detection methods. In this study, we compiled a database of AI and real coastal-related tourism photos to analyze their visual differences, and the detection accuracy of both human and deep learning models. While real photos display diverse color schemes and richer textures, AI photos exhibit enhanced brightness and simplified textures. Despite such significant differences in color and texture features, human judgment largely fails to distinguish AI from real photos, resulting in an average accuracy of only 67.7 %. To address this limitation, a hybrid deep learning model was developed, combining a CNN module for image processing and a dense module for integrating explicit visual features. While a single CNN module achieved an accuracy of 92.9 %, largely outperforming human judgment, the inclusion of explicit features further improves the model’s accuracy to 96.1 %, highlighting the importance of multimodal feature integration. The study contributes to understanding the implications of generative AI in marketing, underscores the importance of transparency for online content, and advances methodological approaches for detecting AI-generated visuals.}

abstract = {This study proposes a pattern-free layout method for continuous generation and optimization of heliostat positions based on optical efficiency. Using annual weighted cosine efficiency as the objective function, the initial layout is generated through a continuous search from the optimal point of the entire field. This is followed by a secondary optimization and selection of all heliostats based on annual weighted optical efficiency. Points with efficiency above the threshold are retained, while low-efficiency points are discarded and re-entered into the search optimization until all eligible heliostat positions are identified, ultimately resulting in a highly efficient heliostat field. The efficiency improvement from the generative pattern-free layout optimization is primarily attributed to the initial search using annual weighted cosine efficiency, which enhances the annual weighted cosine efficiency of the field, and the secondary screening optimization, which improves shading and blocking efficiency. Compared to the original PS10 heliostat field, the annual weighted efficiency increased by 1.77%. Finally, two clustering-based pattern-free layout methods are proposed. The total distance from all points within a K-means cluster to the reference center is 58,238.1974 m, a reduction of 71.18% compared to the untreated original heliostat field. The method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model reduces the distance to the reference center by 66.90%. Classification based on optical efficiency reflects the overall distribution structure of the heliostat field’s optical efficiency, reducing the layout difficulty of pattern-free heliostat fields and providing feasibility for transforming theoretical research into practical engineering applications.}

Our previous studies have demonstrated that matrine can effectively reduce hepatosteatosis and associated disorders. However, it is poorly understood whether the gut microbiota involved in the attenuation of liver fibrosis by matrine. Herein we explored a novel mechanism of how oral administration of matrine alleviates liver fibrosis by modulating gut microbiota. Administration of matrine not only potently ameliorated liver fibrosis in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced mice, but also significantly preserved hepatic heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) in vivo and in vitro. Matrine was failed to reduce liver fibrosis when HSP72 upregulation was blocked by the HSP72 antagonist VER-155008. Also, consumption of matrine significantly alleviated gut dysbiosis and fecal metabonomic changes in CCl4-treated mice. Transplanted the faces of matrine-treated mice induced a remarkable upregulation of HSP72 and remission of fibrosis in liver in CCl4-exposed mice and inhibition of TGF-β1-induced inflammatory response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AML-12 cells. Furthermore, deficiency of HSP72 partly reversed the intestinal microbial composition that prevented matrine from reducing CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice. This study reveals the "gut microbiota-hepatic HSP72" axis as a key mechanism of matrine in reducing liver fibrosis and suggest that this axis may be targeted for developing other new therapies for liver fibrosis.}

The interaction of five homonuclear diatomic gases, Cl2, F2, H2, N2 and O2, with several pure metals are examined using Coulomb's law to calculate the attractive and repulsive forces between the electrons or ions in the gas molecule and the free surface metallic electrons or ions assuming a Bohr model. These calculations demonstrate that the total energy of the electrostatic fields from the metals can exceed the molecular binding energies of Cl2, F2, and O2 at some distance from the metallic surface thereby suggesting that these gases interact primarily with the metallic surface in their atomic states after molecular bond dissociation prior to reaction. In contrast, H2 and N2 gases do not dissociate prior to reaching the metal surface due to the fact that the effective charge of the gas ions is less than the total electron charge at the outermost electronic shell. The present results correlate linearly with the electrochemical series standard reduction potential as well as with the Pauling electronegativity for several metals.}

Two elastically bent mirror (EBM) modules, each of which is composed of an elastically bent mirror and a loading mechanism, are integrated into a non-orthogonal two-axis Lloyd's mirror interferometer. The deflections of the X- and Y-EBMs can generate nonlinear components in the wavefronts of the X- and Y-beams, resulting in a stationary interference fringe field with variable pitches along the X- and Y-directions, respectively. The pitch specifications (the center pitch and the pitch variation range) of the grating can be adjusted by changing the corresponding module parameters (the tilt angle and the applied load). Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that for EMBs with a dimension of 450 mm (length) × 250 (width) × 2 mm (thickness), the center pitch can be linearly adjusted within the range of 680 nm–1290 nm with respect to a tilt angle range of 10°, while the pitch variation range is independently adjustable from 60 nm to 130 nm with respect to an applied load range of 8 N. Two-axis VLS grating structures with a center pitch of 1000 nm and a pitch variation of ±45 nm are successfully fabricated over a fabrication area of 100 mm × 100 mm, which demonstrates the feasibility of the developed system.}

As open pits, sandboxes in New York City public playgrounds are potentially exposed to fecal inputs from various sources, including wild and domestic animals. A longitudinal study of thirteen sandboxes located in public playgrounds on the east side of Manhattan reveals ubiquity of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci and Escherichia coli through all seasons. The highest concentrations of bacteria occur in surface sand (n = 42; mean enterococci 230 MPN/g and E. coli 182 MPN/g dry weight), with significantly lower levels at depths below the surface (n = 35; mean enterococci 21 MPN/g and E. coli 12 MPN/g dry weight), a stratification consistent with fecal loading at the surface. Generalized linear mixed models indicate that sand depth (surface vs. underlayers) is the most influential variable affecting bacterial levels (P <0.001 for both enterococci and E. coli), followed by sampling season (P <0.001 for both). Bacterial concentrations do not vary significantly as a function of playground location or ZIP code within the study area. Children’s exposure while playing in sandboxes likely reaches 105 enterococci and 104 E. coli in a typical play period. Microbial source tracking to identify fecal hosts reveals dog, bird, and human biomarkers in low concentrations. Open sandbox microcosms installed at ground level in the urban environment of Manhattan are fouled by enterococci and E. coli within two weeks, while adjacent closed microcosms exhibit no fecal contamination over a 33-day sampling period. Collectively, our results indicate that increasing the frequency of sand refills and covering sandboxes during times of disuse would be straightforward management strategies to mitigate fecal contamination in playground sandboxes.}

abstract = {Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings are quite popular worldwide due to their low construction costs, despite being susceptible to significant damage even from moderate earthquakes. In many cases, reconstruction may not be the most viable option due to financial and time constraints. Among the available retrofit solutions, steel-reinforced shotcrete (SRS) proves to be a cost-effective, straightforward, yet effective method for repair/retrofitting. This paper presents the results of an experimental study aimed at evaluating the effects of various construction conditions on the rebar pullout resistance of steel-reinforced shotcrete used as a retrofit method for URM walls. To achieve this, a total of 46 full-scale URM specimens were manufactured and tested, each consisting of a one-sided 50 mm-thick shotcrete layer with a single 8 mm steel rebar. The variables examined included the condition of the URM surface before the shotcrete application (wet/dry, with/without finishing including plaster/scratched plaster/oil paint), the condition of the rebar surface (rusty/clean), the type of rebar (plain/ribbed), rebar cover in the shotcrete layer (20/25/30 mm), and the URM substrate temperature before application of shotcrete (20 °C/-16 °C). The results indicate that there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens under the following conditions: when the wall's finishing is removed, the wall's surface is wetted before shotcrete application, ribbed steel rebar is utilized, and the temperature of URM before shotcrete application is 20 °C, there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens by 58 %, 56 %, 32 %, and 13 %, respectively. Additionally, when the steel rebar cover is sufficient, ribbed steel rebar is utilized, and this rebar is rusted, there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens by 55 %, 10 %, and 6 %, respectively.}

Aged type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are linked with lower serum levels of total antioxidant activity, magnesium and zinc, particularly under uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled oxidative stress is an established contributor to diabetic complications. Magnesium is a cofactor for ∼600 enzymes, while zinc is a part of ∼3000 human proteins, essential for intermediary metabolism. A multi-targeted approach combining β-carotene, Magnesium and Zinc (BMZ) with metformin or vitamin E, Magnesium and Zinc (EMZ) with metformin for daily use in aged rats with T2DM identified astonishing findings compared to metformin monotherapy. Over three months, compared to metformin monotherapy, BMZ with metformin provided excellent glycemic control, outstanding protection against potential neuropathy and sensorimotor coordination, maintained robust retinal integrity and provided significant control for diabetic nephropathy. Mechanistically, the significant improvement in BMZ with metformin in controlling retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are directly linked to (1) Increased glycemic control (antihyperglycemic effect), (2) increased insulin sensitivity as evidenced by reduced HOMA-IR levels, (3) reduced oxidative stress (4) increased antioxidant activity through increased glutathione levels and increased GSH/GSSG ratio, and (5) improved regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as evidenced by metabolomic data. This study provides robust and direct evidence to support the use of affordable, proven antioxidant and mineral combinations with metformin to reduce diabetes-related complications in aging.}

However, an important caveat in this approach lies in the lack of reference data, limiting the possibility of developing acoustic biodiversity indices and assessing their sensitivity to environmental change. To address this issue, previous studies have attempted to generate “engineered soundscapes”, that is artificial soundscape recordings which offer some control on, among other aspects, species diversity. Unfortunately, these tools lack complexity and realism, limiting their ecological validity. Here, we introduce Evascape, a Python algorithm informed by available knowledge in soundscape ecology aiming at producing assembled soundscapes with high ecological validity. The algorithm offers the possibility to control biophony (number of species, number of individuals, time organization), geophony (wind and rain with adjustable level), anthropophony (aircraft noise) and sound propagation effects (frequency-dependent attenuation function of the habitat). The algorithm was tested using an acoustic database collected in a protected European cold forest. The generated assembled soundscapes were then used to assess a selection of commonly-used ecoacoustic indices across a large number of controlled scenarios, and to identify the indices that respond most strongly to changes in species richness. Evascape opens the path to other ecoacoustics-related research programs, offering the possibility to design empirical and computational experiments with controlled soundscape parameters.}

abstract = {Background
An increasing number of users are turning to web-based sources as an important source of health care guidance information. Thus, trustworthy sources of information should be automatically identifiable using objective criteria.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to automate the assessment of the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) criteria, enhancing our ability to pinpoint trustworthy health information sources.
Methods
A data set of 538 web pages displaying health content was collected from 43 health-related websites. HONcode criteria have been considered as web page and website levels. For the website-level criteria (confidentiality, transparency, financial disclosure, and advertising policy), a bag of keywords has been identified to assess the criteria using a rule-based model. For the web page–level criteria (authority, complementarity, justifiability, and attribution) several machine learning (ML) approaches were used. In total, 200 web pages were manually annotated until achieving a balanced representation in terms of frequency. In total, 3 ML models—random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)—were trained on the initial annotated data. A second step of training was implemented for the complementarity criterion using the BERT model for multiclass classification of the complementarity sentences obtained by annotation and data augmentation (positive, negative, and noncommittal sentences). Finally, the remaining web pages were classified using the selected model and 100 sentences were randomly selected for manual review.
Results
For web page–level criteria, the random forest model showed a good performance for the attribution criterion while displaying subpar performance in the others. BERT and SVM had a stable performance across all the criteria. BERT had a better area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, 0.98, and 1.00 for neutral sentences, justifiability, and attribution, respectively. SVM had the overall better performance for the classification of complementarity with the AUC equal to 0.98. Finally, SVM and BERT had an equal AUC of 0.98 for the authority criterion. For the website level criteria, the rule-based model was able to retrieve web pages with an accuracy of 0.97 for confidentiality, 0.82 for transparency, and 0.51 for both financial disclosure and advertising policy. The final evaluation of the sentences determined 0.88 of precision and the agreement level of reviewers was computed at 0.82.
Conclusions
Our results showed the potential power of automating the HONcode criteria assessment using ML approaches. This approach could be used with different types of pretrained models to accelerate the text annotation, and classification and to improve the performance in low-resource cases. Further work needs to be conducted to determine how to assign different weights to the criteria, as well as to identify additional characteristics that should be considered for consolidating these criteria into a comprehensive reliability score.}

Some content quickly reaches considerable popularity because it is accessed and shared on a large scale, especially in social networks, thus having a potential for going viral. Thus, this study aimed to identify the algorithms and software used for fake news detection. The choice for this combination is justified because in Brazil this process is carried out manually by verification agencies and thus, based on the mapping of the algorithms identified in the literature, an architecture proposal will be developed using artificial intelligence. As a methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in the Science Direct and Scopus databases using the keywords "fake news" and "machine learning" to locate reviews and research articles published in Engineering fields from 2018 to 2023. A total of 24 articles were analyzed, and the results pointed out that Facebook and X11Twitter has been renamed to X on July 23, 2023. were the social networks most used to disseminate fake news. Moreover, the main topics addressed were the COVID-19 pandemic and the United States presidential elections of 2016 and 2020.

This risk is compounded by young adults’ low levels of mental health literacy and limited competencies in implementing strategies promoting mental health and well-being in their daily lives. Previous research suggests that digital mental health apps may be particularly effective in increasing the mental health literacy of young adults. In Sweden, there is a lack of research on young adults’ unique perspectives on what constitutes mental health, well-being, and ill-health—perspectives that could inform the coproduction of evidence-based interventions targeting these issues.
Objective
The overarching aim of this study was to conduct a needs assessment as part of coproducing a digital mental health app for Swedish young adults. More specifically, the study addressed two research questions: (1) What do Swedish young adults perceive as contributing to the mental health, well-being, and ill-health of themselves and their peers? (2) What are Swedish young adults’ preferences and ideas on how a digital mental health app can support their mental health during young adulthood, including their perspectives on the app’s usability?
Methods
We conducted semistructured interviews with 16 young adults and analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
Of the 16 study participants, 9 (56%) identified as women and 7 (44%) as men. Their mean age was 23.6 (SD 4.22; range 18-29) years. Furthermore, 56% (9/16) were pursuing or had obtained a higher education degree, while 44% (7/16) had completed or were in the process of completing a high school diploma. The interviews and subsequent analysis revealed three main themes: (1) “To feel that life is worth living”—pathways through pressures and pursuit of mental well-being during young adulthood, (2) “A personal space for working on one’s own mental well-being”—digital companionship with others, and (3) “Something that is designed for me”—customizing one’s digital mental health journey.
Conclusions
In line with the preferences of Swedish young adults, the promotion of mental health and well-being through digital technology and eHealth should focus on a customizable app that supports balance in daily life while strengthening mental health competencies. The content should center on fostering and maintaining meaningful relationships and activities, addressing challenges such as negative social media use and stress recovery, and enhancing mental health knowledge and peer support. Future efforts should focus on researching young adults’ experiences of the life phase of emerging adulthood and its implications for mental health. In addition, future technical development and research on digital mental health apps should include the perspectives of stakeholders, such as mental health professionals, and involve prototype testing with diverse groups to ensure the app’s relevance, user engagement, and effectiveness.}

As its adoption gains momentum, understanding the potential risks associated with employee-GenAI collaboration becomes increasingly important. While much of the existing research emphasizes the challenges GenAI presents to employees as individuals, this study shifts the focus to explore broader organizational risks, particularly unethical workplace behaviors. Drawing on human-AI collaboration research and the job demands-resources model, we develop and empirically test a novel model to explain how and when employee-GenAI collaboration may lead to employees’ unethical behavioral outcomes in daily organizational contexts. Using an experience sampling approach with longitudinal data from 229 service industry employees, encompassing 1050 matched daily observations, our findings reveal that employee-GenAI collaboration increases work alienation—a sense of disconnection from work—which, in turn, drives employee expediency that compromises work standards. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect is pronounced under high digital job demands. By highlighting this unintended consequence, our study contributes to theoretical advancements in understanding the darker side of employee-GenAI collaboration and provides practical insights to help organizations harness the benefits of GenAI while mitigating its potential ethical pitfalls.}

Spray drying based on atomization using high pressure or supercritical CO2 has been shown to be effective in improving therapeutic efficiency of drugs by forming smaller particles, owing to the distinct solvation power and enhanced mixing potential of supercritical CO2. Several parameters contribute to the critical quality attributes of the final atomized pharmaceutical products resulting from CO2-assisted atomization including high-pressure nozzle design, drying chamber geometry, and operating pressures and temperatures. In this context, the work is focused on a detailed analysis of supercritical CO2 through micro-orifices used in a spray drying enhanced atomization process. We present a computational fluid dynamics model, developed using Ansys FLUENT, to describe the flow of pure, pressurized CO2 through a micro-orifice undergoing trans-critical expansion. After establishing grid independence, the computational model was validated by comparing model predictions to measured mass flow rates and temperature distribution of the cooling effect of CO2 free jet over an adiabatic surface. For supercritical inlet conditions and a nozzle orifice size of 80 µm, experimental results matched predictions reasonably well. The simulated results demonstrated the occurrence of shock waves, a prerequisite for fine droplets formation. Simulated results were critically analyzed to develop new insights into intricate fluid dynamics of flow of CO2 through atomization orifices and an attempt is made to evolve specific guidelines. The presented model and results will be useful for researchers and engineers interested in understanding and optimizing CO2-assisted spray atomization processes.}

The local water supplies of the three study DACs, located in Salinas Valley, California, were contaminated with nitrate at levels (∼ 12–87 mg/L NO3−−N) above the California maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg/L NO3−−N, and had elevated water salinity (∼600–1,600 mg/L total dissolved solids(TDS)) above its secondary MCL (SMCL) of 500 mg/L TDS. Well water nitrate removal and salinity reduction were accomplished via reverse osmosis (RO) based DWTD systems that operated autonomously, supported by remote monitoring and supervisory cyberinfrastructure. Reliable DWTD operation provided treated water quality, with respect to nitrate and salinity, in the range of 0.5–6.3 mg/L NO3−−N and 57–161 mg/L TDS, respectively, which were well below the respective MCL and SMCL. The levelized cost of water treatment was in the range of ∼$2/m3- $2.9/m3 which aligns with typical residential water costs in California and in the study region, and monthly residential water costs ($39-$74/residential unit/month) were also within the range in California. The study showcased the DWTD approach as a viable and potentially scalable solution for upgrading impaired local potable water supply of communities lacking centralized water delivery infrastructure. However, streamlined permitting processes and standardized regulatory frameworks are critical to promoting wider adoption and maximizing the socio-economic benefits of the DWT approach. Moreover, DACs are likely to require government subsidies in order to cover the CapEx of DWTD systems in addition to upgrade of site infrastructure.}

abstract = {Context:
Test-Driven Development (TDD ) is an agile development approach where the writing of unit tests precedes the writing of production code. Some software engineers have been advocating the use of TDD to develop Embedded Systems (ESs) despite the lack of empirical evidence on TDD applied to ES development.
Objectives:
Our overarching objective is to start building knowledge on TDD applied to ES development. Specifically, we investigated: (i) the claimed benefits of TDD (i.e., increased external quality of ESs and developers’ productivity) and (ii) how developers apply TDD when developing ESs.
Method:
We conducted two empirical investigations. The former investigation, comprising two experiments, aimed to study the claimed benefits of TDD. To that end, we asked Computer Science (CS) Master’s students to fulfill ES development tasks by using TDD or a non-TDD approach. The latter investigation consisted of an ethnographically-informed study to gain insights into how developers apply TDD when developing ESs. In this study, we involved CS Master’s students, who were observed while fulfilling an ES development task. The participants in the two empirical investigations were different.
Results:
We found that the external quality of the developed ESs increased when using TDD as compared to a non-TDD approach, while there was not a substantial difference in developers’ productivity. However, TDD is perceived as more difficult to apply, and the development task is deemed more challenging with TDD. Several patterns emerged about how developers approach TDD when developing an ES (e.g., the participants did not always develop in conformity with TDD).
Conclusion:
TDD seems to be a promising approach to the development of ESs, even though further research is needed. In this regard, we believe that our results can pave the way for future research with the involvement of software companies and professionals.}

Existing adaptation approaches and research informing them largely focus on outcomes of climactic events, but lack consideration of power structures shaping these phenomena and experiences of them. From a feminist peace perspective, I posit that tackling intersectional violences of climate change necessitates greater engagement with underlying knowledge. This paper explores how ways of knowing climate change impact ways of living with it: analyzing the ground on which climate action interventions stand and the paths on which they set us. I theorize ‘climate transformation’ as processual shifts in ways of knowing a problem and solution toward norms of a feminist peace. Theory is developed abductively, based on original fieldwork in Puerto Rico and drawing on conflict transformation theory and elaborating knowledge production through feminist ethics of care. The model developed here enables analyzing orientations of current situations and change processes in relation to desirable futures. I find that actors involved in peace work and climate action in Puerto Rico foster transformation based on: caring in current relations and experience; caring through change processes affectively and reciprocally; and caring for a vision of the future through prefigurative and historicized imagination. The framework advances academic study and policy development on transformative climate action for tackling historic and intersectional violences to influence and enact particular visions of peace.}

This study explored the mechanism of saponin biosynthesis and its role in alleviating Cd-induced oxidative damage in the Zhe-Maidong cultivar using three experimental groups undergoing Cd stress. In the Cd-contaminated soil treatment, total saponins were 1.68 times higher than those in the control. The saponin content in the Cd-2 and Cd-3 treatments was approximately twice as high as that in the Cd-CK treatment. These findings revealed that Cd stress leads to total saponin accumulation. Metabolomic analysis identified the accumulated saponins, primarily several monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids. The increased saponins exhibited an antioxidant ability to prevent the accumulation of Cd-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent saponin application experiments provided strong evidence that saponin played a crucial role in promoting superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reducing ROS accumulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed vital genes for saponin synthesis under Cd stress, including SE, two SSs, and six CYP450s, positively correlated with differentially expressed metabolite (DEM) levels in the saponin metabolic pathway. Additionally, the TF-gene regulatory network demonstrated that bHLH1, bHLH3, mTERF, and AUX/IAA transcript factors are crucial regulators of hub genes involved in saponin synthesis. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the regulatory network of saponin synthesis and its role in reducing oxidative damage in O. japonicum when exposed to Cd stress.}

Therefore, it is possible to obtain digital evidence through forensic investigation of the smartphone if a suspect has used his or her smartphone while connected to a vehicle’s IVI system.

The Android log messages are stored in multiple circular buffers kept by the Android logging system. The Bluetooth HCI snoop log, a type of log file, is a record of all Host Controller Interface (HCI) commands and events transmitted through Bluetooth on an Android device. From the two forensic data sources, we have identified lots of digital artifacts including as MAC address of the connected vehicle, the vehicle information, the time when being connected and disconnected to a vehicle, phone call history, etc. We also analyze the differences of digital artifacts obtained from the Android log messages and the Bluetooth HCI packets.

abstract = {Background
Online record access (ORA) is being increasingly implemented internationally. Despite reported benefits for patients, health care professionals (HCPs) have raised concerns about potential disadvantages. To date, no review has examined the empirical evidence on whether and how documentation changes following the introduction of patients’ ORA.
Objective
This scoping review aimed to examine potential subjective and objective changes in HCPs’ documentation after using patients’ ORA.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using a methodological framework for scoping reviews and data from 4 electronic databases. Studies examining objective and subjective changes in clinical documentation following the implementation of ORA, specifically those related to actual use experiences (rather than previous expectations), up to July 2023, were included. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the included studies. The narrative synthesis and reporting of findings were guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews).
Results
Of the 3143 papers screened, 42 (1.34%) were included in this review. The included studies mainly used qualitative methods and were predominantly published after 2016 in the United States. The included studies were conducted in different settings (inpatient and outpatient) and clinical areas (somatic, mental health, and other). In total, 8 studies analyzed clinical notes, while the remaining studies focused on the experiences of patients, HCPs, and other stakeholders with ORA. Objectively, a decrease in complexity, an increase in readability, and a change in the emotional tone of the clinical notes were observed. The length of the clinical notes was observed to change both objectively and subjectively, although the direction of this change was inconclusive. However, many HCPs also reported writing notes that were less open and more restrictive to protect sensitive or hypothetical information. While for some HCPs the implementation of ORA made the clinical notes a less efficient and valuable working tool, others perceived that ORA opened up new therapeutic opportunities through direct contact with patients.
Conclusions
The question of whether an inherently uniform clinical note can meet the diverse needs of different health care stakeholders remains unresolved, highlighting the challenges of standardizing practices in this complex sector. While ORA may encourage HCPs to make their clinical notes more patient friendly, it may also compromise the integrity of documentation by omitting sensitive findings and expert judgment, which can put patients at risk and lead to errors that increase the risk of malpractice. Given the limitations of digital documentation in fostering trust, it is imperative to prioritize meaningful patient-HCP interactions. The use of compensatory measures, such as parallel documentation and restricted access to clinical notes, indicates systemic problems and suggests that current practices are suboptimal.

It builds on previous studies of concepts of teachers’ PDC, digital transformations in education, and school leadership, supplemented by findings from two empirical studies on school leadership in schools with 1:1 coverage of digital devices. Based on this, the paper presents an initial conceptualisation of PDC for school leaders, illustrating how digital technologies impact both administrative and pedagogical leadership. The paper has merits for the research community interested in school leadership, digitalisation, professional digital competence, education, and schools.}

This process entails modelling, texturing, and XR programming. In the literature, no automatic CAD-to-XR frameworks simultaneously manage CAD simplification and texturing. There are no examples of their adoption for User-Centered Design (UCD). Moreover, such CAD-to-XR workflows do not seize the potentialities of generative algorithms to produce synthetic images (textures). The paper presents a framework for implementing the CAD-to-XR workflow. The solution consists of a module for texture generation based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generated texture is then managed by another module (based on Shrinkwrap modelling) to develop the iPVP by simplifying the 3D model and UV mapping the generated texture. The geometric and material data is integrated into a graphic engine, which allows for programming an interactive experience with the iPVP in XR. The CAD-to-XR framework was validated on two components (rifle stock and forend) of a sporting rifle. The solution can automate the texturing process of different product versions in shorter times (compared to a manual procedure). After each product revision, it avoids tedious and manual activities required to generate a new iPVP. The image quality metrics highlight that images are generated in a “realistic” manner (the perceived quality of generated textures is highly comparable to real images). The quality of the iPVPs, generated through the proposed framework and visualised by users through a mixed reality head-mounted display, is equivalent to traditionally designed prototypes.}

abstract = {Purpose
In spite of the fact that today’s supply chains are global, it is surprising the current research lacks studies primarily focusing on Latin American (LATAM) firms. To enhance our understanding in this domain, this study examines the impact of technology investments on inventory turnover, asset turnover and employee productivity measures within the LATAM context.
Design/methodology/approach
We use an unbalanced panel of over 2,101 firm-year observations from the Worldscope database between 2010 and 2022 and limit our analysis to firms located in the Latin American region. We use panel data and regression analysis to test our hypotheses.
Findings
The findings reveal a positive impact of technology investments on inventory turnover, asset turnover and employee productivity.
Originality/value
There is a dearth of research in the discipline primarily focusing on the firms from the LATAM region. The extant literature has largely focused on the Western firms and we know from prior cross-cultural research that there are significant differences in terms of how firms and governments operate differently in emerging and non-Western regions such as LATAM or parts of Asia and Africa. By specifically focusing on a sample of LATAM firms, the study makes important contributions to the extant literature with respect to the role of technology investments in improving inventory turnover, and also on asset turnover and employee productivity. The study further provides implications for practice.}

abstract = {Background
Misinformation in health and health care contexts threatens public health by undermining initiatives, spreading dangerous behaviors, and influencing decision-making. Given its reach on online platforms and social media, there is growing demand for interventions addressing misinformation. Literature highlights the importance of theoretical underpinnings (frameworks and models) to guide the development of educational interventions targeting both the features of misinformation and the human traits that increase susceptibility.
Objective
This review examines literature on online interventions targeting health misinformation to mitigate adverse public health impacts. It explores intervention types, population demographics, susceptibility-related human attributes, and misinformation characteristics addressed. It also identifies the theoretical underpinnings used and gaps in the literature.
Methods
The review followed a methodological framework and adhered to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A search strategy combining Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords was used to search five databases for studies published between 2018 and 2024. Identified studies underwent deduplication, title and abstract screening using predefined eligibility criteria, full-text screening, and data extraction.
Results
The initial search yielded 513 citations; 30 (5.8%) studies were included after screening. Of these, 19 (63%) focused on COVID-19 misinformation, 11 (37%) on other health contexts, and 1 (3%) addressed misinformation conceptually. Regarding intervention type, 22 (73%) used educational courses, 7 (23%) employed counter speech, and 1 (3%) used inoculation games, with some overlap. Sixteen (53%) interventions targeted characteristics of misinformation, categorized as content and presentation tactics, cognitive and psychological biases, social and cultural influences, and dissemination strategies. Seven (23%) interventions focused on specific demographics, while 14 (47%) addressed human attributes that heighten susceptibility. These attributes were grouped into knowledge and processing, emotional and psychological factors, and trust and social dynamics. Theoretical underpinnings guided intervention development in 23 (77%) studies, often overlapping in categories including inoculation and correction, education and cognition, motivation and emotion, behavior and persuasion, trust and belief, and learning design.
Conclusions
Online interventions targeting health misinformation often share outcome goals and use overlapping strategies such as educational courses, counter speech, and inoculation games. Many adopt multifaceted approaches to address misinformation’s complexity. However, gaps remain in tailoring interventions to misinformation characteristics that could improve specificity and impact. Few studies focus on human attributes contributing to belief in and spread of misinformation, particularly among vulnerable groups. While theoretical models are commonly cited, clearer reporting and stronger connections to intervention design are needed. Collaboration among intervention developers, theorists, and psychologists is recommended to enhance future interventions.

abstract = {The optimum usage of fertilizers is key for the sustainable agriculture. Among nutrients, phosphorus (P) is critical for plant growth and development. Due to complete reliance on natural resources (rock phosphate) for P, the availability of P fertilizers is emerging as a global challenge for crop cultivation. Moreover, the excess application of P fertilizers in rice, mostly grown under flooded conditions, leads to water pollution called eutrophication. In this study, we employed a mutagenesis approach for developing and characterizing rice EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) mutants with better adaptation to low soil P conditions. One such mutant of rice cultivar Nagina 22, named NH4824, was characterized comprehensively at seedling and reproductive growth stages under hydroponic and field conditions. The mutant exhibits low soil P tolerance due to combined adaptive changes in root system architecture, anatomy, organic acid exudates, plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase activity, induced expression of P transporter genes, and efficient mobilization and partitioning of P in different plant tissues. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and better photosynthesis suggested relatively less stress experienced by NH4824 than N22 under low soil P conditions. These insights are highly useful to develop P use efficient crop cultivars through breeding or genome editing approaches.}

abstract = {Objective
This study examined the cross-sectional relationships between neighborhood social composition and gentrification, and acculturation stressors.
Methods
Person-level data came from first-generation Chinese immigrants enrolled in the Immigrant Enclaves Study (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, baseline 2018–2020, N = 512). A validated scale was used to assess 22 stressors associated with migration or acculturation. Neighborhood characteristics from the American Community Survey 2015–2019 and 2008–2012 included: tract proportion of foreign born Chinese, neighborhood wealth, and past decade gentrification. Most neighborhood exposures were modeled as continuous as well as binary variables (intended to represent highest level of neighborhood exposure). Multivariable negative binomial regression adjusted for age, gender, income, education, employment, language, years in the U.S., and neighborhood variables (proportion co-ethnic, and neighborhood per capita income).
Results
The majority of participants spoke Mandarin (68% vs Cantonese 32%), mean participant age was 52.7 years old, years in the US was 18, and nearly one-half of the sample had less than 8 years of education. Mean number of stressors was 5.9 with nearly 20% of participants reporting 11 or more stressors. Multivariable results found the number of acculturation stressors was 18% lower for residents in the highest co-ethnic density neighborhoods and 13% lower for residents in the highest wealth areas, compared to other areas (expβ 0.82, 95% CI [CI] 0.69, 0.98; expβ 0.87, CI 0.75, 1.01, respectively). Stressors were no different whether participants lived in gentrified areas or not.
Conclusions
Among middle-aged Chinese immigrants, acculturation stress was lower for residents in neighborhoods with higher proportion of Chinese immigrants and for residents in neighborhoods with higher wealth, whereas gentrification had no influence on acculturation stress. More work on this topic is needed with vulnerable populations such as this one, informed by local context.}

Problem-solving ability is a key factor in early childhood development, furnishing children with vital cognitive and behavioral strategies for navigating diverse future scenarios. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between participating in household chores and problem-solving abilities among young children and the role of parental scaffolding from the perspective of parent-child interactive dynamics in two steps. First, young children (n = 125, Mage = 4.13-year-old, SD = 0.61) participated in problem-solving tasks, while concurrently, their parents completed a structured questionnaire evaluating children's household chore involvement and parental scaffolding strategies. The second study analyzed the patterns of parental scaffolding using videos of parent-child interactions(n = 31). The results revealed a significant positive correlation between involvement in household chores and problem-solving ability, with parental scaffolding moderating this relationship. Moreover, video analyses revealed a pattern of high-level parental scaffolding during problem solving for household chores. Specifically, parents tended to provide more cognitive scaffolding in the initial stages of problem solving, gradually reduce interventions as the task progressed to allow the child to feel autonomy, and provide high-quality emotional scaffolding throughout the task. These findings highlight the positive effect of participation in household chores on the development of problem-solving abilities among young children as well as the importance of parental scaffolding being provided and withdrawn in a timely manner according to young children's needs.}

From addressing administrative tasks to answering dermatology questions, these models are poised to have an impact on dermatology care delivery. As FMs become more ubiquitous in health care, it is important for clinicians and dermatologists to have a basic understanding of how these models are developed, what they are capable of, and what pitfalls exist. In this paper, we present a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the current state of FMs and summarize their current applications in dermatology, highlight their limitations, and discuss future developments in the field.}

In addition, using integrated multi-channel eye-tracking, Education Data Mining techniques, and data fusion provides information about how each student deploys these strategies at the process level (rather than the results level) and at a level of detail that other techniques do not. The general objectives of this study were: (1) Determine whether students’ behaviours in the LMS predicted results of their learning in different evaluation tests (individual vs. group); (2) Determine whether behavioural records (physiological and eye-tracking) produced with integrated multi-channel techniques predicted learning results in different evaluation tests (individual vs. group); (3) Test whether student behaviours in resources and activities in ALT environments differed depending on the degree type; and (4) Determine whether the results of monitoring student behaviours in ALT environments via integrated multi-channel technology using heat maps and gaze point differed depending on the students’ learning results. The study was performed during one semester with a sample of 64 university students in their final year of health sciences or biomedical engineering degrees. Their learning behaviour in terms of activities and resources in Moodle was monitored along with their use of self-regulated virtual labs for promoting thinking skills. Learning results were assessed using traditional multiple-choice tests and project-based learning assessments (execution and presentation). The results indicate that the variance in the results explained by the use of activities and resources aimed at acquiring thinking skills was greater in project-based learning assessments in both course groups. In addition, the variance explained by the indicators of cognitive load measured by eye-tracking and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) was greater for the learning results in traditional testing. The use of ALT resources and self-regulated virtual laboratories enhanced students’ acquisition of thinking skills. Nonetheless, learning activities must be carefully designed and learning behaviours need to be monitored during the learning process in order to tailor the educational response. This requires better teacher—and student—training in using these resources and in interpreting the resulting records.}

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory condition affecting the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa, often accompanied by olfactory dysfunction. Eosinophilic CRS with nasal polyps (ECRSwNP) is a subtype of CRS characterized by eosinophilic infiltration. Animal models for ECRSwNP with olfactory dysfunction are necessary for exploring potential therapeutic strategies.
Objective
The aim of this study was to establish a mouse model of ECRSwNP combined with olfactory dysfunction in a shorter time frame using intranasal ovalbumin and Aspergillus protease (AP) administration. The efficacy of the model was validated by evaluating sinonasal inflammation, cytokine levels, olfactory function, and neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb.
Methods
Male BALB/c mice were intranasally administered ovalbumin and AP for 6 and 12 weeks to induce ECRSwNP. The resultant ECRSwNP mouse model underwent histologic assessment, cytokine analysis of nasal lavage fluid, olfactory behavioral tests, and gene expression profiling to identify neuroinflammatory markers within the olfactory bulb.
Results
The developed mouse model exhibited substantial eosinophil infiltration, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in nasal lavage fluid, and confirmed olfactory dysfunction through behavioral assays. Furthermore, olfactory bulb inflammation and reduced mature olfactory sensory neurons were observed in the model.
Conclusion
This study successfully established a validated mouse model of ECRSwNP with olfactory dysfunction within a remarkably short span of 6 weeks, providing a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis and potential therapies for this condition. The model offers an efficient approach for future research in CRS with nasal polyps and olfactory dysfunction.}

This paper investigates the efficacy of an ILE integrated with ChatGPT in the context of computer networking education. A pilot experiment was conducted with three graduate students with basic IT networking background. The study examined the impact of integrating ChatGPT within the ILE on students’ engagement, comprehension, and overall learning outcomes. Methodological details, including learning program design, learning outcomes assessment, ILE settings, and ChatGPT integration are presented. Results from pre- and post-assessment tests, quizzes, and students’ feedback on ChatGPT’s utility as a learning aid are discussed. The findings suggest a significant improvement in students’ comprehension and performance following their engagement with the ILE while using ChatGPT as a support tool. Despite a few drawbacks reported by the students in terms of the interfaces’ ease of use, and the timely response and appropriate content delivered by ChatGPT, they were overall satisfied with the experience. The students would recommend ChatGPT for learning purposes under certain controlled environments. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on interactive learning technologies and highlights the potential of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT to revolutionize computer networking education in the digital age.}

The present work advances this emerging field by focusing on the human-GenAI dyad. Specifically, we propose a formal model of hybrid creative process designed to maximize the synergistic potential of the human-GenAI interaction. Drawing on machine learning literature, we conceptualize GenAI as a superposition of latent entities. Through formal argumentation, we demonstrate that optimal creative outcomes arise when human agents actively select the most appropriate entity from the complete spectrum of potential alternatives for the problem at hand. Finally, we outline the ideal iterative process required to asymptotically converge toward these optimal entities. Beyond its practical utility for managers, our model provides new insights into human-GenAI mutual augmentation, the nature of creativity, and the skills and cognitive properties involved.}

The Product Information files for all centrally authorized drug products containing a small molecule active ingredient were retrieved programmatically from the European Medicines Agency Web site. Text processing isolated relevant information, including the maximum clinical dose, dosage form, route of administration, excipients, and pharmacokinetic performance. Chemical and bioactivity data were integrated through automated linking to external curated databases. The capability of this database to inform oral medicine development was assessed in the context of drug-likeness evaluation, excipient selection, and prediction of oral fraction absorbed. Existing filters of drug-likeness, such as the Rule of Five, were found to poorly capture the chemical space of marketed oral drug products. Association rule learning identified frequent patterns in tablet formulation compositions that can be used to establish excipient combinations that have seen clinical success. Binary prediction models of oral fraction absorbed constructed exclusively from regulatory data achieved acceptable performance (balanced accuracytest = 0.725), demonstrating its modelability and potential for use during early stage molecule prioritization tasks. This study illustrates the impact of highly linked drug product data in accelerating clinical translation and underlines the ongoing need for accuracy and completeness of data reported in the regulatory datasphere.

Positive genetic correlations were observed among meat color traits.

Unlike conventional methods, which treat such a task as an optimization problem, we approach it as an adaption problem to be solved by combining a self-organized multi-agent system (MAS) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The approach involves two steps. The first is design constraints pre-processing, which comprises (a) initial user input, and (b) pre-processing for initial setup. The second is building plan generation, involving (a) perception, (b) planning, and (c) action modules. Multiple illustrative examples are explored to verify the proposed generative design algorithm in terms of robustness, efficiency, and scale. We discover that the algorithm can handle complex combinations of input constraints (e.g., number of rooms, room areas, adjacency connections, and building boundaries) and generate plausible floorplans in a robust, efficient way that can be scaled up to bigger, more complex floorplan generative design problems. With proper adaptation, the algorithm can potentially be applied to other building types, such as office or hospital buildings.}

abstract = {Post-earthquake damage assessment of bridge portfolios faces challenges in balancing efficiency and accuracy. While machine learning offers a promising solution, it often faces difficulties due to complex damage scenarios and imbalanced data, where safe samples vastly outnumber those requiring inspection or classified as dangerous. This imbalance limits the performance of machine learning models. To address these issues, this study proposes a rapid seismic damage assessment method for bridge portfolios using a SMOTE-enhanced XGBoost model. By utilizing bridge parameters and seismic data, this method eliminates the need for time-consuming on-site inspections, enabling quick and accurate predictions of bridge safety and traffic capacity. SMOTE is used to generate synthetic samples for all categories, with sampling ratios carefully adjusted to determine the optimal configuration that maximizes accuracy and improves data balance. The enhanced XGBoost model is then trained on the balanced dataset to classify bridge conditions, effectively mitigating the impact of class imbalance. The study also compares the performance of XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost on both original and SMOTE-balanced datasets. Results indicate that the SMOTE-enhanced XGBoost model achieves a best accuracy of 83.3 %–87.5 %. This study integrates oversampling techniques with machine learning and proposes an automated modeling framework for imbalanced data. Its key innovation lies in the automatic determination of the optimal oversampling ratio, which is incorporated into the XGBoost training process to significantly improve classification performance and generalization ability, providing reliable support for emergency response and functional recovery.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of hospital admission is an innovative tool that optimizes resource allocation and improves patient flow within emergency departments. Health institutions need to decongest these departments to maintain sustainability and become efficient. Increasing demand and excessive competition for limited resources directly contribute to these challenges.
Objective
This systematic review aims to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence in the prediction of hospital admissions, evaluating the accuracy of machine learning models, their impact on clinical decision- making, and their role in the optimization and allocation of resources.
Methods
A systematic review of studies published between 2019 and 2024 followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were selected based on a pre-defined Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework, and methodological quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (ChAMAI) tools.
Results
A total of 20 studies were included; most of the studies evaluated were retrospective. AI-based models demonstrated superior accuracy (85 % to 95 %) compared to traditional methods, with Random Forest (RF) and Neural Networks outperforming classical statistical models. Studies incorporating unstructured data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) have significantly improved patient flow and resource allocation. The integration of predictive analytics resulted in a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations, optimized bed occupancy, and a decrease in emergency room overcrowding.
Conclusion
AI-driven admission prediction is promising in the hospital setting, as it improves efficiency and allows for proactive and rapid decision-making, optimizing available resources. Future research is promising and should focus on prospective studies to validate practical applicability.}

This systematic review aims to provide multi perspectives on human cybersecurity behavior by evaluating and synthesizing cybersecurity theories/models, independent variables, target variables, moderators, methodologies, participants, units of analysis, technologies/services, countries, and domains. Of 2936 articles collected, 93 studies met the inclusion criteria and were thoroughly analyzed. The main results revealed that the protection motivation theory (PMT) and theory of planned behavior (TPB) were the most common theories in the analyzed literature. 76% of the analyzed studies did not involve a moderator to examine the relationships between predictors and target variables. Most of the studies were conducted at the individual level, mainly involving students and end-users. Social media and mobile devices were the most common tools examined for human cybersecurity behavior. Most of the studies were conducted in the education sector, with a limited number of studies examining the healthcare sector. Behavioral intention and cybersecurity behavior were the primary target/outcome variables in the analyzed studies.

Research in developmental cognitive neuroscience indicates that individuals with dyslexia show functional and structural brain alterations in regions processing reading and reading-related information, with some of these differences emerging as early as preschool and even infancy. This suggests that some children start schooling with less optimal brain architecture for learning to read, emphasizing the need for preventative education practices. This article reviews educational policies impacting children with dyslexia and highlights a decentralized parent-led grassroots movement, Decoding Dyslexia, which centers the voices of those directly impacted by dyslexia. It utilizes civic engagement practices, advocacy and lobbying on local, federal, and social media platforms, and strong partnerships with scientists to drive systems-level change in educational practices, leading to dyslexia prevention legislation across the U.S. The ongoing partnership continues to address the profound gaps between scientific findings and policymaking to drive systems-level change for contemporary challenges in educational practices within a learning disabilities framework.}

abstract = {Background
Sleep games are an emerging topic in the realm of serious health game research. However, designing features that are both enjoyable and effective at engaging users, particularly university students, to develop healthy sleep habits remains a challenge.
Objective
This study aims to investigate user preferences for 3 sleep game prototypes, that is, Hero’s Sleep Journey, Sleep Tamagotchi, and Sleepland, and to explore their popularity and perceived utility in promoting sleep health.
Methods
A mixed methods approach was used in this study. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a co-design workshop involving 47 university students. Participants were presented with storyboard cards of game features and were asked to provide an overall rating on each game, as well as ratings for individual features. They were also encouraged to provide free-form comments on the features and suggest improvements. In addition, participants were asked to express their preferences among the 3 games regarding which game they would most like to play and which one they found most useful for promoting sleep health.
Results
Surprisingly, while Hero’s Sleep Journey was the most popular choice among participants, Sleep Tamagotchi was perceived as the most beneficial for improving sleep health. Relevance emerged as an overarching theme in the qualitative data analysis, with 3 interconnected dimensions: psychological relevance to users’ personal lives, logical relevance to sleep health, and situational relevance to users’ circumstantial context. We discussed how the 3 dimensions of relevance address the autonomy and relatedness constructs outlined in the self-determination theory and proposed 3 design recommendations.
Conclusions
Our serious sleep game prototypes demonstrated the potential to engage university students to develop healthy sleep hygiene. Future sleep game designs should aim to create a sense of relevance to users’ personal lives, sleep health goals, and situational contexts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, it is essential to develop a wide range of game genres and features to cater to diverse users. Aligning game features with sleep health goals and educating users on the design rationale through sleep knowledge are also important aspects. Furthermore, allowing users to customize their game experience and manage technology boundaries is necessary to nurture a sense of control and autonomy in the process of forming good sleep hygiene.}

Some suggest generative AI could offer decision-makers perspectives they had previously not considered, leading to more equitable and innovative policy approaches, and supporting several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We critique this perspective. Groups may be underrepresented in sustainable development decision-making because of individual cognitive and organisational information-processing limitations (‘omitted, but not opposed’), and because of opposition which remains even if these limitations are overcome (‘opposed, whether omitted or not’). We outline how these ‘categories of omission’ shape the opportunities and risks created by generative AI in representative sustainability.}

This study proposes probability models that convert the natural snowpack stability index estimated by the physical-based snowpack model into the probability of the number of dry-snow avalanches per day. For this purpose, three types of probability models formulated by Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Inflated Poisson distributions were developed, assuming that the avalanche occurrences follow a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. In these models, the expected number of avalanches per day increases exponentially with larger unstable snowpack areas where the stability index is below a threshold. Bayesian inference has optimized the models to fit the historical avalanches from the winter of 1958/1959 to the winter of 2011/2012 in December, January, and February in north Japan and Niigata regions. The optimized models largely replicated the probability density function of the number of historical avalanches and their exponential increase with increasing unstable snowpack areas. The posterior predictive checks and the widely applicable information criteria both indicated that the model formulated by Negative Binomial distribution best reproduced the number of historical avalanches. However, the models underestimated the number of avalanches in recent decades due to the nonhomogeneity in the statistical sensitivity of avalanche occurrences to the snowpack instability. We also demonstrated some practical applications of the models, such as predicting avalanche occurrences and reproducing the annual number of avalanches.}

abstract = {Background
Cannabis consumption has increased in recent years, as has cannabis use disorder. While researchers have explored public online community discussions of active cannabis use, less is known about the popularity and content of publicly available online communities intended to support cannabis cessation.
Objective
This study aims to examine the level of engagement and dominant content of an online community for cannabis cessation through 3 specific aims. First, we examine the use of a subreddit cannabis cessation community (r/leaves) over time to evaluate the popularity of this type of resource for individuals who want to stop using cannabis. Second, we examine the content of posts in the community to identify popular topics related to cessation. Third, we compare the thematic findings relative to the 4 domains of recovery defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). By examining these 3 gaps, we take the initial steps toward understanding the experiences being shared online among individuals interested in cannabis cessation and compare them with the principles outlined in the SAMHSA definition of recovery.
Methods
Using the Pushshift application programming interface, we collected the count of posts by year between 2011 and 2021 and the narrative of the 100 posts with the most comments per year in a popular cannabis cessation–focused subreddit (r/leaves). A linear model and a nonlinear model were compared to evaluate change in the number of posts by year. Mixed natural language processing and qualitative analyses were applied to identify top terms, phrases, and themes present in posts over time. Overlap between themes and the 4 SAMHSA domains of recovery (health, purpose, community, and home) were examined.
Results
The number of annual posts in r/leaves increased from 420 in 2011 to 34,841 in 2021 (83-fold increase), with exponential growth since 2018. The term that was the most common across posts was “smoke” (2019 posts). Five major themes were identified, and a narrative arc was represented, from motivations and perceived benefits of cannabis use to the negative consequences of use, strategies to change behaviors, and the positive and negative consequences of change. There was substantial overlap between these 5 themes and 3 of SAMHSA’s 4 domains of recovery: health, purpose, and community. However, the domain of home was less commonly identified.
Conclusions
Engagement in this online cannabis support community appears to be increasing. Individuals using this forum discussed several topics, including multiple aspects of recovery defined by the SAMHSA. Online communities, such as this one may, serve as an important pathway for individuals seeking to reduce or cease their consumption of cannabis.}

The albumin nanocomposites were prepared by spray drying method using mannitol alone or in combination with 10 % or 20 % leucine as matrix. After formulation optimization of the albumin nanocomposites, 20 % albumin nanoparticle/70 % mannitol/10 % leucine (20 %NP/70 %M/10 %L) nanocomposite microparticles were selected as the optimized formulation. The nanocomposite comprising this optimized inhalation formulation formed spherical particles with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 25.5 ± 7.7 %. Homogeneous and stable CLZ-HSA-NPs were obtained after re-dispersion in water. Compared with bulk clofazimine, clofazimine-loaded nanocomposites exhibited rapid drug dissolution (74.9 ± 2.7 %, after 15 min). The amount of cellular uptake and the antibacterial effect of clofazimine in the nanocomposite microparticles were comparable to that of clofazimine solution.

Uncertainty at various stages of the visualization pipeline may give rise to misleading visual representations. These comprise misleading elements that may negatively impact the audiences by contributing to misinformed decisions, delayed treatments, and a lack of trust in medical information. We investigate whether visual narratives within the setting of an educational game support recognizing and addressing misleading elements in healthcare-related visualizations. Our methodological approach focuses on three key aspects: (i) identifying uncertainty types in the visualization pipeline which could serve as the origin of misleading elements, (ii) designing fictional visual narratives that comprise several misleading elements linking to these uncertainties, and (iii) proposing an interactive game that aids the communication of these misleading visualization elements to broad audiences. The game features eight fictional visual narratives built around misleading visualizations, each with specific assumptions linked to uncertainties. Players assess the correctness of these assumptions to earn points and rewards. In case of incorrect assessments, interactive explanations are provided to enhance understanding For an initial assessment of our game, we conducted a user study with 21 participants. Our study indicates that when participants incorrectly assess assumptions, they also spend more time elaborating on the reasons for their mistakes, indicating a willingness to learn more. The study also provided positive indications on game aspects such as memorability, reinforcement, and engagement, while it gave us pointers for future improvement.}

However, existing CRS approaches face two critical challenges: limited incorporation of historical user interactions and unrealistic experimental settings that fail to reflect real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose FuseRec, a novel framework that enables any Sequential Recommender System (SRS) to function as a conversational recommender through integration with an ad-hoc Planner. The integration leverages the inherent strength of SRS in processing long-term historical interactions while the Planner learns conversation strategies. Additionally, a CRS module refines recommendations by incorporating conversational context, effectively fusing sequential patterns with real-time dialogue insights. To create realistic evaluation environments, we implement an advanced GenAI-based user simulator with stratified personas reflecting varying degrees of preference awareness, from users with clear preferences to those with abstract, uncertain preferences. To handle multi-faceted user behaviors, the Planner employs four sophisticated actions: Chitchat, semantic questioning (Semantic Q), attribute questioning (Attribute Q), and Recommend, dynamically adjusting based on user response patterns. We train the Planner through reinforcement learning with curriculum strategy based on user difficulty levels. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FuseRec significantly outperforms existing approaches in recommendation accuracy while showing remarkable adaptability across different user types and recommendation scenarios.}

Based on the conversation data, decision-making behaviour data and environmental data generated in the collaborative learning process, a set of data-driven higher-order thinking skills identification methods integrating situation and conversation are designed. The method includes four steps: situation identification and modelling, text extraction, situational semantic analysis, and semantic flow-based modelling. Compared with traditional methods such as questionnaires and interviews, the ability identification driven by conversation data realizes the direct representation of higher-order thinking skills, which has real-time performance and higher reliability. What’s more, integrating situational information into the learning analysis model improves the accuracy of ability identification results from the pragmatic level.}

abstract = {This paper experimentally investigates how individuals use generative AI to learn and respond in a strategic reasoning contest. An advisor based on level k theory and implemented using ChatGPT is introduced in a four-stage beauty contest experiment. The experiment is designed to explore how AI advisors influence the depth of human reasoning by shaping beliefs, learning, and sophisticated backward induction. Extended cognitive hierarchy models (Camerer et al., 2004) are applied to identify heterogeneous level distribution and more sophisticated thinking. Additionally, the interactions between participants with and without AI advisors are examined. Two key results emerge. First, individuals overestimate AI capabilities when competing against AI-guided participants, which motivates them to employ higher levels of thinking. This observed higher-level behaviour is driven by more sophisticated backward reasoning. Second, improved reasoning under AI guidance shows heterogeneous effects across Cognitive Reflection Test scores, suggesting that AI's impact depends on participants' pre-existing cognitive abilities. Overall, this early research provides insights into the interaction between generative AI and human cognition and reasoning.}

abstract = {Bioretention systems for managing urban runoff rely on healthy plants to reduce runoff and nutrient pollution via evapotranspiration and uptake. However, loss of plant cover is common and, in cold climates, potentially caused by the application of road salt. To investigate the impact of road salt on bioretention systems, we measured salt concentrations in the media and plant tissues and assessed plant cover at 19 sites in Toronto, Canada, in the field. Winter road salt was identified as the primary driver of plant cover loss: low-tolerance species accumulated excessive sodium and chloride, resulting in chlorotic and necrotic damage even under moderate salinity (median electrical conductivity (EC), 0.31–0.35 mS/cm, as measured in soil–water suspensions). Continuous EC monitoring showed no net salt buildup in any season, although salinity peaked in winter and was lower in summer. Low-tolerance species exhibited high salt ion uptake and substantial damage from legacy salt retained in the media. Although species-specific ion accumulation patterns were observed, they did not always align with species salt tolerance as described in the literature. Among the 14 species studied, Hemerocallis ‘Happy Returns’ (low tolerance) and Panicum virgatum (medium tolerance) significantly accumulated sodium, up to 2126 and 586 mg/kg, respectively, whereas Salvia officinalis (medium tolerance) significantly accumulated chloride (up to 20 mg/g); yet only Panicum virgatum displayed minimal damage (<5 %), while Hemerocallis ‘Happy Returns’ and Salvia officinalis displayed >50 % damage. These findings underscore the importance of selecting salt-tolerant species to ensure long-term bioretention performance.}

The findings revealed L2 written argumentation has gathered global interest across all educational levels. Primary topic focuses were on language usage, pedagogy, and assessment, while there was less interest in the actual quality of the argumentative content. The most frequently used theoretical frameworks were theories related to modified Toulmin models, cognition, society and culture (i.e., sociocultural theory), linguistic complexity, and genre. Research methodologies were mostly quantitative. Implications and recommendations for those working on L2 argumentative writing are discussed.}

Generative AI (Gen AI) has the potential to mitigate these limitations by enhancing efficiency and standardization, yet its deployment also introduces risks such as algorithmic bias and loss of transparency. This calls for a systematic framework to support strategic decision-making and guide responsible adoption. This study introduces the Maturity–Expectation Gap (MEG) framework, which captures the misalignment between stakeholder perceptions of AI maturity and the actual technological state. Existing models such as the Technology Acceptance Model fail to reflect the temporal and institutional dynamics of emerging technologies. To address this, the study combines expert survey data on perceived maturity with machine learning-based literature analysis to compute expectation scores across twenty-four evaluation criteria. Results show that MEG significantly varies across stakeholder groups, and that higher MEG values are associated with lower confidence in Gen AI adoption, highlighting the framework's utility in explaining strategic adoption decisions (RQ1). Furthermore, MEG enables diagnostic classification of evaluation domains, identifying areas of alignment (e.g., Financial Health) and misalignment (e.g., Decision-Making), thereby supporting phased and risk-aware deployment strategies (RQ2). MEG framework offers a structured lens for managing expectation–capability alignment, extending technology adoption theory while supporting strategic decision-making for the responsible integration of Gen AI in public-sector evaluation systems.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendation performance of four artificial intelligence chatbots in fictional pulpal and periradicular disease cases. Additionally, it investigated response consistency and the influence of text order and language on chatbot performance.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, eleven cases representing various pulpal and periradicular pathologies were created. These cases were presented to four chatbots (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Bard, and Bing) in both Portuguese and English, with the information order varied (signs and symptoms first or imaging data first). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons, simple logistic regression, and the binomial test.
Results
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy rates (86.4 % and 85.3 % respectively), significantly outperforming ChatGPT 3.5 (46.5 %) and Bard (28.6 %) (p < 0.001). For treatment recommendations, ChatGPT 4.0, Bing, and ChatGPT 3.5 performed similarly (94.4 %, 93.2 %, and 86.3 %, respectively), while Bard exhibited significantly lower accuracy (75 %, p < 0.001). No significant association between diagnosis and treatment accuracy was found for Bard and Bing, but a positive association was observed for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 (p < 0.05). The overall consistency rate was 98.29 %, with no significant differences related to text order or language. Cases presented in Portuguese prompted significantly more additional information requests than those in English (33.5 % vs. 10.2 %; p < 0.001), with the relevance of this information being higher in Portuguese (29.5 % vs. 8.5 %; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, while Bard showed the lowest accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the clinical application of these tools necessitates critical interpretation by dentists, as chatbot responses are not consistently reliable.}

abstract = {Background
Peer influence is a significant determinant in shaping students' academic performance, yet it is often overlooked in traditional educational strategies. The ability to analyze peer influence and collaboration is an important piece in personalizing student educational experiences.
Objective
This study aims to investigate how peer interactions can be used to predict students' achievement levels and create clusters based on these predictions. Building on these clusters, a novel AI-driven approach is introduced to personalize the learning experiences for each group, providing content aligned with students' predicted achievement levels and ensuring that students receive the right resources throughout their entire education.
Methods
Bi-weekly surveys were conducted throughout the academic year with 45 students enrolled in a computer science program, where students nominated up to five peers they collaborated with the most. The data were used to construct a weighted directed graph (also known as directed network), a type of directed graph allowing multiple edges between the same nodes. Centrality measures were calculated from this directed graph to classify students into low-achieving and high-achieving groups for two-class classification, and into low-achieving, high-achieving, and neutral groups for three-class classification. Generative AI was then utilized to create tailored learning scenarios for each student cluster. For high achievers, the scenario includes providing advanced topics, critical-thinking quizzes and supplementary materials such as research papers and real-world projects. For low achievers, these materials include foundational course materials, multiple-choice quizzes and supplementary materials like videos and step-by-step visualizations. The neutral group was given the option to request specific learning materials and self-assessment quizzes on demand to address their individual learning needs.
Results
Eigenvector centrality of the peer collaboration network was identified as the best predictor of student achievement. To assess students' perceived acceptance of the proposed AI-driven personalization, a questionnaire was distributed. The responses indicated that students found the idea appealing and believed it could enhance their learning experience. Several suggestions for improvement were also provided, which will be used to refine the proposed solution in future iterations. Several improvements to the classification mechanism that can enhance its accuracy and effectiveness were also identified during the process.
Conclusion
The findings of this research provide educators, administrators, and policymakers with essential information that can be used to build targeted interventions and support systems for students early in their studies. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on educational strategies, enhancing positive peer interactions and developing a learning environment that provides support and motivation to all students.}

This shift has impacted English Language Teaching (ELT), leading to the rise of Global Englishes Language Teaching (GELT), which advocates a more inclusive and accurate approach to ELT. However, implementing GELT faces significant barriers, particularly the lack of learning materials, which stifles innovation. Digital technologies, especially recent advancements. In Generative AI (GenAI), offer new avenues for overcoming these challenges. Adopting a critical ecological perspective, this study explores the potential and limitations of GenAI in developing and implementing GE-oriented materials from teachers’ perspectives at a secondary school in China. Data collected through reflective journals, classroom observations, roundtable discussions, and video-stimulated recall interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Findings suggest that AI enhances efficiency in material development, supports student-centred design, integrates well with digital resources, and boosts student engagement. However, challenges include rigid curricular structures, AI inaccuracies, technical issues, and AI’s inability to replace teachers’ unique insights. This study argues that AI offers promising support for GE-oriented materials development, with teachers’ unique role remains indispensable in GELT. Methodological, pedagogical, and empirical implications are discussed.}

Additionally, recent studies have indicated variations in the serum levels of adipokines in pigs with higher fat content, suggest their common interaction. It was therefore hypothesized that ITLN1 regulates the levels of other adipokines and their receptors in the ovary of pigs with different fat content. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effect of ITLN1 (10–100 ng/mL) on the levels of other adipokines, namely adiponectin, apelin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, visfatin, and vaspin in the culture medium, assessed by ELISA. In addition, the effect of ITLN1 on the mRNA expression of the above-mentioned adipokines with their receptors was investigated using RT-qPCR in granulosa cells (Gc) from normal weight Large White (LW) and fat Meishan (MS) pigs on days 10–12 of the estrous cycle. The results showed that ITLN1 reduced apelin levels, increased leptin, and had no effect on vaspin in the culture medium. ITLN1 was found to have a modulating effect on the mRNA expression of the other adipokines with their receptors in porcine Gc. It can, therefore, be proposed that ITLN1 represents a previously unidentified auto- and paracrine regulator of the functions of ovarian microenvironmental compartments in different types of pig breeds.}

Our results show that ITTP has focused on the quantitative promotion of students and alums from various countries and their learning of Korea-centric ICT, policies, and culture. In particular, the Korean government’s lax evaluation of ITTP performance has led to weak responsibility, ambiguous task identity, missed opportunities for self-improvement, and low participation among students and stakeholders. These findings highlight the need for graduate programs and their stakeholders to reinforce internal and external evaluations of the program’s performance and provide feedback for reciprocal development.}

This study investigates how PCE, conceptualised through the dimensions of language stylistics, personalisation, and labelling, affects UX outcomes, including performance, task management, and user satisfaction. The sample consisted of 294 respondents from China and Kenya. Using a user-centred approach, this study applies partial least squares structural equation modelling for empirical analysis. The results show that PCE significantly improves UX (β = 0.304, t = 3.965, p < 0.001) and acts as a proxy for implicit human feedback in LLM optimisation. Mediation analysis confirms that data management and prompting experience significantly explain the relationships (p < 0.001), whereas simple slope analysis supports the moderation effects of perceived usefulness, task fit, and quality. The findings suggest that user edits serve as fine-grained feedback signals that enhance personalisation and usability in academic contexts. These results inform the design of more flexible and feedback-aware LLM systems, thereby advancing the development of human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence.}

Mechanical hyperalgesia in the hindpaws of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic (DBT) rats was assessed using the electronic Von Frey test (VFT), before diabetes induction and for up to 32 days after STZ administration and intraperitoneal ATL (0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 ng/rat) treatment, alone or in combination with intrathecal CB1 or CB2 receptor agonists (ACEA or JWH-133, respectively; 10 or 30 μg/rat). The effect of ATL treatment on locomotor activity and anxious or depressive-like behaviors was also evaluated. In comparison to control normoglycemic rats, control DBT rats developed: 1) mechanical hyperalgesia; 2) increase in anxious and depressive-like behaviors. ATL treatment attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in DBT rats both acutely (at 30 ng) and cumulatively (at doses of 1, 3, 10, or 30 ng), without compromising locomotor activity. The antinociceptive effect of ATL (at 1 or 3 ng) was augmented when combined with ACEA or JWH-133 treatments (only at a dose of 30 μg/rat). While ATL treatment alone reduced anxious-like behavior in DBT rats, it did not affect depressive-like behavior. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of ATL, in diabetic complications, suggesting a possible interaction with the endocannabinoid system.}

Therefore, to clarify the performance degradation mechanism and predict the performance of asphalt mixture under the action of wet-dry history, the creep-recovery test, indirect tensile stiffness modulus test and indirect tensile strength test were conducted at different temperatures. The finite element method was adopted to analyze the moisture diffusing profile inside the specimen after wet-dry cycles. A moisture damage model considering the soaking time and repeated characteristics was developed to predict the damaged properties. Results show that wet-dry cycles cause a slight mass loss of asphalt mixture. Wet-dry cycling action leads to the increment in high-temperature deformation, and reductions in stiffness modulus and tensile strength. The increase of high-temperature deformation is primarily caused by viscoplastic component. Even if the soaking time is short, high moisture damage occurs while the wet-dry cycle is sufficient. Numerical simulations show that the moisture concentration profiles inside asphalt mixture vary under different wet-dry histories, leading to variations in the damage zone. The degree of damage is also closely related to the acting time of moisture. The critical immersion time of the dense asphalt mixture (about 43 hours) was determined in this study. When the immersion period is shorter than the critical immersion time, the strength loss is greater than the modulus. On the contrary, the degree of modulus damage is higher than that of strength. Considering the actual rainfall climate in China, the strength damage of the on-site asphalt mixture in the field predominates. The proposed model could reflect the weakening trends of modulus and strength. It has good universal applicability in predicting the damaged Marshall stability, modulus, and strength at different temperatures.}

This study compares direct laser machining (DLM) and waterjet-assisted laser micromachining (WJALM) in preparing LAR zirconia microchannels, focusing on surface morphology, heat-affected zones, microhardness, chemical and phase composition. Subsequently, parameter experiments of WJALM were carried out to achieve superior machined quality LAR zirconia microchannels by assessing the geometric profile and ablation-area-ratio. Experimental results indicated that WJALM significantly surpasses DLM, achieving a 46 % decrease in areal surface roughness (Sa), WJALM reduced the heat-affected zone depth by approximately 37 % compared to DLM. The WJALM process also enhanced the ablation-area-ratio by 61 %, achieving superior machining quality under optimized conditions of 27 W laser power, 100 mm/s scanning speed, and 8 m/s waterjet velocity.}

From that description, the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale is proposed as a means to assess the extent of an individual's internalization of the new form of thinking. A preliminary empirical investigation with 132 higher education professors and students found the instrument to be statistically consistent, yielding a unidimensional and Gaussian score that behaves as a developmental trait emerging from the interaction with generative AIs, mediated by age and mastery of previous digital technologies and their cultural elements. It is concluded that the results are suggestive of the validity of the new scale and warrant further research.}

The research uses the TVP-SV-VAR methodology to recognise the ever-changing correlation among the artificial intelligence index (AII), global supply chain pressure indicator (GSCPI) and global energy-related uncertainty index (GEUI). In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe. In the context of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, this study will provide significant recommendations to maintain global supply chain stability and energy sustainability by applying artificial intelligence technology.}

These articles were qualitatively analyzed to identify the PSAIS mentioned and their alignment with STEM principles. The PSAIS were then validated by academic and professional experts. The analyses revealed that PSAIS include advanced technological skills, such as knowledge of specialised software, data analysis, big data, and artificial intelligence. In addition, a solid understanding of mathematical and statistical concepts is considered crucial for interpreting and analyzing accounting information. The development of PSAIS is therefore key to characterizing accounting as a STEM discipline.

Methionine γ-lyase (MGL) is the key enzyme involved in the production of VSCs, such as methanethiol and ethanethiol, coinciding with the upregulation of durian MGL (DzMGL) during fruit ripening. Although the VSCs present in durian pulps have been extensively studied, the regulation of genes involved in VSC production in fruit has not yet been explored. Yeast one-hybrid screening of the promoter of durian MGL (pDzMGL) and ca. 1200 Arabidopsis transcription factors (TFs) together with a transcriptomics analysis identified candidate HD-ZIP TF families in durian. Here, dual-luciferase assays, in silico promoter analysis, and electrophoresis mobility shift assays were performed to confirm the interaction between pDzMGL and DzHD-ZIP1.8. The results revealed that the ethylene-responsive DzHD-ZIP1.8 localized in the nucleus, where it functioned as an activator and bound to pDzMGL to control its expression during ripening. Therefore, a TF that regulates the expression of DzMGL in durian fruit during ripening was identified in this study. Moreover, this study elucidated the molecular regulation of an important gene involved in VSC production, which affects consumer preferences.}

Existing studies often fail to capture the structural characteristics of crop canopies, such as organ overlapping and resource competition. To address this issue, we propose a 3D maize modeling method based on computational intelligence. An initial 3D maize canopy is created using the t-distribution method to reflect characteristics of the plant architecture. The subsequent model considers the 3D phytomers of maize as intelligent agents. The aim is to maximize the ratio of sunlit leaf area, and by iteratively modifying the azimuth angle of the 3D phytomers, a 3D maize canopy model that maximizes light resource interception can be constructed. Additionally, the method incorporates a reflective approach to optimize the canopy and utilizes a mesh deformation technique for detecting and responding to leaf collisions within the canopy. Six canopy models of 2 varieties plus 3 planting densities was constructed for validation. The average R2 of the difference in azimuth angle between adjacent leaves is 0.71, with a canopy coverage error range of 7% to 17%. Another 3D maize canopy model constructed using 12 distinct density gradients demonstrates the proportion of leaves perpendicular to the row direction increases along with the density. The proportion of these leaves steadily increased after 9 × 104 plants ha−1. This study presents a 3D modeling method for the maize canopy. It is a beneficial exploration of swarm intelligence on crops and generates a new way for exploring efficient resources utilization of crop canopies.}

The innovation capability largely determines the initiative for future development of a region. Higher school is the main position for training innovative talents. Accurate and comprehensive assessment of innovation cultivation capability is an important basis of higher schools for continuous improvement. Thus, this paper focuses on assessing innovative talent cultivation capability. First, by CIPP model (Context, Input, Process and Product Evaluation), an assessment indicator system is built, consisting of 89 indicators in 21 categories. Then, based on indicator characteristics, this paper uses public data statistics, database retrieving, student survey, teacher survey, support personnel and expert investigation, to collect indicator values. After this, by a powerful machine learning algorithm, gradient Boosting regression tree, a capability assessment model is established. And based on collected data, established model is compared with several regression models in innovative talent cultivation capability assessing.

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide a transcript of a dialogue among literacy educators and researchers on the impact of generative aritficial intelligence (AI) in the field. In the spring of 2023, a lively conversation emerged on the National Council of Research on Language and Literacy (NCRLL)’s listserv. Stephanie initiated the conversation by sharing an op-ed she wrote for Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the rise of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, moving beyond the general public’s concerns about student cheating and robot takeovers. NCRLL then convened a webinar of eight leading scholars in writing and literacies development, inspired by that listerv conversation and an organizational interest in promoting intergenerational collaboration among literacy scholars.
Design/methodology/approach
As former doctoral students of two of the panel participants, webinar facilitators Grace and Victoria positioned themselves primarily as learners about this topic and gathered questions from colleagues, P-16 practitioners and those outside the field of education to assess the concerns and wonderings that ChatGPT and generative AI have raised. The following webinar conversation was recorded on two different days due to scheduling conflicts. It has been merged and edited into one dialogue for coherence and convergence.
Findings
Panel participants raise a host of questions and issues that go beyond topics of ethics, morality and basic writing instruction. Furthermore, in dialogue with one another, they describe possibilities for meaningful pedagogy and critical literacy to ensure that generative AI is used for a socially just future for students. While the discussion addressed matters of pedagogy, definitions of literacy and the purpose of (literacy) education, other themes included a critique of capitalism; an interrogation of the systems of power and oppression involved in using generative AI; and the philosophical, ontological, ethical and practical life questions about being human.
Originality/value
This paper provides a glimpse into one of the first panel conversations about ChatGPT and generative AI in the field of literacy. Not only are the panel members respected scholars in the field, they are also former doctoral students and advisors of one another, thus positioning all involved as both learners and teachers of this new technology.}

Drawing upon the attitudinal ambivalence perspective (i.e., the simultaneous occurrence of positive and negative evaluations of genAI use) and cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, our study proposes and tests an integrative research model to understand how users' attitudinal ambivalence towards genAI technology navigates their negative and positive emotional responses and shapes their post-adoption behaviors. We surveyed 530 genAI users and employed the structural equation modeling approach to test our research model. We find that attitudinal ambivalence is significantly associated with users' extended use and avoidance through the mediation of user trust and fear. Additionally, transparency significantly moderates the effects of attitudinal ambivalence on user trust and fear. Our study advances nature and consequences of attitudinal ambivalence towards genAI and provides insights for practitioners contemplating deploying genAI.}

However, the discrepancy between designer inputs and model-preferred prompts makes it challenging for designers to consistently deliver effective results to end users. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel hybrid method that assists designers in crafting user-centric prompts for T2I models, ensuring that the generated UIs align with end-user expectations. First, this method merges text mining and Kansei Engineering (KE) to analyze online user reviews and construct a Knowledge Graph (KG), mapping the intricate relationships between diverse affective requirements of users, design features, and corresponding text prompts for UI generation. Then, our approach automatically transforms designer inputs into model-preferred prompts through entity mention recognition and entity linking during the human-AI collaborative design process. Finally, we validate the proposed approach with a case study on automotive human–machine interface design. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance in perceived efficiency, satisfaction, and expectation disconfirmation. Overall, this study represents a step forward in integrating human and AI contributions in design and innovation within engineering disciplines, enabling AI to inspire, develop, and reinforce human creativity from a human factors perspective.}

Utilizing varied prompt engineering techniques, the study evaluates the efficacy of GPT-based services from OpenAI in interpreting the nuanced semantic network structures of BPMN-as-RDF and the standard control flow hierarchical decomposition of BPMN-as-XML. Although image-based multi-modal interpretation of BPMN diagrams is also available in such services, our work is motivated by the fact that most BPM systems deliver structured serializations and not images through their APIs; moreover, any data stored in diagrams cannot be scrutinized by computer vision capabilities, being set as annotations in most tools. By exploring both the challenges and effectiveness of utilizing natural language in interacting with BPMN models, the analysis underscores the ability of RDF to mediate semantic richness and open-ended extension of procedural knowledge compared to the closed-world of the XML interchange schemas. Diagrammatic environments are thus encouraged to pursue this as a potential convergence between different means of knowledge representation.}

By providing soft-switching across all semiconductor components, the proposed design could achieve a significant power density increase while still preserving the power conversion efficiency in an acceptable range. The novel control algorithm concurrently governs power factor and output voltage, employing the duty cycle as the primary control variable and the phase shift as an auxiliary parameter.

Study 2 applied fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore configurations of the driving factors that lead to high collaboration quality. Four distinct configurations emerged: 1) Domain knowledge, domestication ability, communication ability, and working memory; 2) Domain knowledge, domestication ability, working memory, and long-term memory; 3) Domain knowledge, communication ability, working memory, and long-term memory; and 4) Domain knowledge, ∼desire for control, domestication ability, communication ability, and long-term memory. These results advance understanding of human-GenAI collaboration by highlighting critical configurations of human and GenAI agency that foster high-quality collaboration. The study offers actionable insights to enhance human-GenAI interactions by optimizing both human and GenAI capabilities.}

abstract = {The increasing use of deepfake technology enables the creation of realistic and deceptive content, raising concerns about several serious issues, including biometric authentication, misinformation, politics, privacy, and trust. Many Deepfake Detection (DD) models are entering the market to combat the misuse of deepfakes. With these developments, one primary issue occurs in ensuring the explainability of the proposed detection models to understand the rationale of the decision. This paper aims to investigate the state-of-the-art explainable DD models across multiple modalities, including image, video, audio, and text. Unlike existing surveys that focus on detection methodologies with minimal attention to explainability and limited modality coverage, this paper directly focuses on these gaps. It offers a comprehensive analysis of advanced explainability techniques, including Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, LRP, Saliency Maps, and Anchors, for detecting deceptive content across the modalities. It identifies the strengths and limitations of existing models and outlines research directions to enhance explainability and interpretability in future works. By exploring these models, we aim to enhance transparency, provide deeper insights into model decisions, and bridge the gap between detection accuracy with explainability in DD models.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data refer to information systematically reported by patients, or on behalf of patients, without the influence of health care professionals. It is a focal point of the health care system’s ambition toward becoming more involving and personalized. It is recognized that PROs provide valuable data. However, despite this recognition, there are challenges related to both patients’ and clinicians’ accurate interpretations of the quantitative data. To overcome these challenges, this study explores text vignettes as a representation of PROs.
Objective
This study aimed to develop data-informed text vignettes based on data from the Readiness and Enablement Index for Health Technology (READHY) instrument as another way of representing PRO data and to examine how these are perceived as understandable and relevant for both patients and clinicians.
Methods
The text vignettes were created from participant responses to the READHY instrument, which encompasses health literacy, health education, and eHealth literacy. The text vignettes were created from 13 individual text strings, each corresponding to a scale in the READHY instrument. This study consisted of 3 sequential parts. In part 1, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed the READHY instrument, providing data to be used to create vignettes based on cluster profiles from the READHY instrument. Part 2 focused on the development of scale-based strings representing all READHY dimensions, which were evaluated through iterative cognitive interviews. In part 3, clinicians and patients assessed the understanding and relevance of the text vignettes.
Results
Clinicians and patients both understood and related to the text vignettes. Patients viewed the text vignettes as an accurate reflection of their PRO responses, and clinicians perceived the text vignettes as aligned with their understanding of patients’ experiences.
Conclusions
Text vignettes can be developed using PRO instruments, with individual scales as input strings. This provides an opportunity to present numeric values in a text format that is understandable and recognizable to most patients and clinicians. Challenges with the vignette’s language and layout require customization and clinician training to ensure meaningful interpretation. Findings also support the need to expand the study and enhance clinical relevance with alternative or contextually relevant text vignettes.}

A comparative analysis was conducted along the five main dimensions of variation that Biber (1988) identified. The findings revealed significant disparities between AI-generated and human-authored texts, with the AI-generated texts generally failing to exhibit resemblance to their human counterparts. Furthermore, a linear discriminant analysis, performed to measure the predictive potential of dimension scores for identifying the authorship of texts, demonstrated that AI-generated texts could be identified with relative ease based on their multidimensional profile. Collectively, the results underscore the current limitations of AI text generation in emulating natural human communication. This finding counters popular fears that AI will replace humans in textual communication. Rather, our findings suggest that, at present, AI's ability to capture the intricate patterns of natural language remains limited.}

The work employs Finite element analysis to measure the scaffolds' maximum principal and Von Mises stresses and strains. CT scans of the Maxilla and Mandible were used to apply load conditions to 3D models of the upper central incisor. In the derived computational model, four different load situations considered were: the masticatory load (70–100 N at 45°), two parafunctional habits (100–130 N) and 500–550 N at the incisal edge, both at 45°), and a trauma case (800–850 N applied perpendicularly from the inwards direction at 90°). The findings revealed that the central tooth region experiences the highest stress concentration, while the Maxilla and Mandible regions show the least stress. These results provide critical insights into the mechanical behavior of scaffolds at bone-tissue interfaces, suggesting a research direction for developing scaffolds that closely mimic real bone characteristics. The results of this study are particularly significant for using bone replacement materials, providing an approach to more effective healing options for bone traumas and degenerative bone disorders.}

abstract = {Background
In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevailing high ambient temperatures should warrant increased daily water intake (DWI) to prevent haemo-concentration and its potential to confound patients' laboratory data.
Aim
To assess the impact that the recommended DWI has on the haemato-biochemical variables in a tropical setting.
Materials and methods
This quasi-experimental study recruited 101 apparently healthy individuals (18–60 years) in the Bawku municipality. DWI, anthropometrics, and haemato-biochemical variables were assessed at baseline. Participants were encouraged to increase their DWI to ≥4 L over a 30-day period; haemato-biochemical variables were re-evaluated. Total body water (TBW) was anthropometrically estimated.
Results
The median post-treatment DWI significantly increased; consequently, anaemia cases increased by >20-fold (2.0 % vs 47.5 % post-treatment). RBC count, platelet count, WBC count, and median haemoglobin significantly decreased compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). Biochemically, median plasma osmolality (p < 0.0001), serum sodium (p < 0.0001), serum potassium (p = 0.0012) and random blood sugar (p = 0.0403) significantly decreased. Compared to baseline, significantly higher proportion of participants classified as thrombocytopenic (8.9 % vs 3.0 %), hyponatraemia (10.9 % vs 2.0 %), or normal osmolarity (77.2 % vs 20.8 %). There were differential bivariate correlations between pre- and post-treatment haemato-biochemical variables.
Conclusion
Sub-optimal DWI is a likely confounder in haemato-biochemical data interpretation in the tropics.}
