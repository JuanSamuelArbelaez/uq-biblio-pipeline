abstract = {Background
Morton’s interdigital neuroma, caused by compression of the interdigital nerve, often requires surgery when conservative treatment fail. This study compared open neurectomy and percutaneous intermetatarsal ligament release (PILR), focusing on various predictive factors.
Methods
A retrospective study, comprising 46 patients (58 feet) with Morton’s neuroma who underwent either open excision (n = 24) or PILR (n = 22) from 2012 to 2022. Data included demographics, MRI-measured neuroma size, complications, and revision surgery. Outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), and satisfaction scores.
Results
Open excision yielded better outcomes than PILR for neuromas larger than 7.40 mm, with lower VAS scores (2.3 vs. 3.9), higher FAAM scores (87 vs. 72), and greater satisfaction (3.2 vs. 2.1). Neuroma width predicted outcomes in the PILR group.
Conclusion
Open excision is superior for larger neuromas, while PILR may suit smaller ones (<7.40 mm).
Level of evidence
Level III cohort study
Clinical relevance
This study highlights the importance of neuroma width in determining the success of percutaneous intermetatarsal ligament release (PILR). Our findings suggest that PILR may be more appropriate for smaller neuromas (<7.40 mm), while open excision offers better outcomes for larger neuromas. This insight could guide surgeons in selecting the most suitable surgical approach, optimizing patient outcomes, and minimizing complications.}

abstract = {Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with treatment strategies primarily including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Although immunotherapies targeting T and natural killer cells are widely used, the development of therapies focusing on neutrophils has been lacking. Neutrophils were regarded as a specialized cell population that, once matured, lacked the capacity for proliferation and were rapidly depleted in circulation, limiting their role to immune defense. However, recent discoveries have revealed that neutrophils represent a highly heterogeneous immune cell population, across diverse microenvironments. They are referred to as tumor-associated neutrophils when recruited to the tumor microenvironment. Initially, tumor-associated neutrophils were believed to primarily promote tumor growth and metastasis. Contrarily, emerging evidence indicates that tumor-associated neutrophils exhibit anti-tumor functions under specific conditions, acting as inhibitors during the initial growth or metastatic phases of lung cancer. This functional heterogeneity positions neutrophils as a promising focus for novel approaches to lung cancer immunotherapy. This review aims to explore the role of tumor-associated neutrophils in lung cancer progression and to investigate responses in the context of tumor control, thereby deepening the understanding of neutrophil function in lung cancer.}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, with approximately 5 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019. Tackling AMR requires a multifaceted and cohesive approach that ranges from increased understanding of mechanisms and drivers at the individual and population levels, AMR surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, improved infection prevention and control measures, and strengthened global policies and funding to development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic strategies. In this rapidly advancing field, this Review provides a concise update on AMR, encompassing epidemiology, evolution, underlying mechanisms (primarily those related to last-line or newer generation of antibiotics), infection prevention and control measures, access to antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship, AMR surveillance, and emerging non-antibiotic therapeutic approaches. The Review also discusses the potential roles of artificial intelligence in addressing AMR, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, AMR surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnosis, and antimicrobial drug discovery and development. This Review highlights the urgent need for addressing the global effects of AMR and for rapid advancement of relevant technology in this dynamic field.}

abstract = {Objectives
To explore the ability of artificial intelligence to produce comparison tables to facilitate shared decision-making.
Methods
An expert human-generated comparison table (Option Grid ™) was compared to four comparison tables produced by large language models and one produced using a Google search process that a patient might undertake. Each table was prepared for a patient with osteoarthritis of the knee, considering a knee replacement. The results were compared to the Option Grid.™ The information items in each comparison table were divided into eight categories: the intervention process; benefits; side effects & adverse effects; pre-operative care; post-operative care & physical recovery; repeat surgery; decision-making process; and alternative interventions. We assessed the accuracy of each information item in a binary manner (accurate, inaccurate).
Results
OpenBioLLM-70b and two proprietary ChatGPT models generated similar frequencies of information items across most categories, but omitted information on alternative interventions. The Google search process yielded the highest number of information items (n = 41), and OpenBioLLM-8b yielded the lowest (n = 20). Accuracy, compared to the human Option Grid, was 97 % for the ChatGPT models and the open-source OpenBioLLM-70b, and 95 % for OpenBioLLM-8b and the Google search process. The human-generated Option Grid had superior readability.
Conclusions
Large language models produced comparison tables that are 3–5 % less accurate than a human generated Option Grid. Comparison tables produced by large language models may be less readable and require additional checking and editing.
Practice implications
Subject to fact-checking and feedback, large language models may have a role to play in scaling up the production of evidence-based comparison tables that could assist patients and others.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The nutritional needs of preterm newborns (PTNB) are increased and enhancing nutritional management is essential to meet them. The addition of multicomponent additive (MA) to human milk (HM) is used as a treatment strategy. The objective of the research is to analyze the association between the use of MA added to HM with nutritional and clinical outcomes in low-birth weight PTNB admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods
Prospective cohort study with PTNB weighing less than 2500 g during hospitalization in the NICU, who were divided into two distinct groups based on the presence or absence of MA supplementation. We investigated outcomes related to nutritional status at discharge, length of stay, presence of metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP), extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) and encouragement of breastfeeding at discharge.
Results
A total of 65 PTNB were included. We found that the lower the BW, the more often the use of MA was observed (p = 0.006). At discharge, there was a decline in z- scores, in which 46 % of PTNB who used MA developed malnutrition. The length of stay was longer in the group of PTNB who used MA (p < 0.001). The percentage of PTNB with MBDP who used MA (52.5 %) was higher than the percentage of those who did not use it (p = 0.006). The probability of PTNB with MBDP using MA is 2.65 times higher than those without MDBP.
Conclusion
The use of MA to HM did not prevent or avoid the decline in nutritional status of the PTNBs, considering that those who used it had greater difficulty gaining weight, longer hospital stays, and more MBPD diagnoses compared to the group that did not use supplementation. However, the MA was crucial as it provided essential nutritional support for those PTNB who are more susceptible to MBDP.}

abstract = {In optimizing the performance and extending the lifespan of lithium batteries, accurate state prediction is crucial. Traditional regression and classification methods have achieved some success in predicting battery states. However, the effectiveness of these data-driven approaches largely depends on the availability and quality of public datasets. Additionally, generating electrochemical data primarily through battery experiments is a lengthy and costly process, making it extremely difficult to obtain high-quality data. This difficulty, combined with data incompleteness, significantly affects prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this study introduces End of Life (EOL) and Equivalent Cycle Life (ECL) as supervised conditions for generative AI models. By integrating an embedding layer into the CVAE model, we developed the Refined Conditional Variational Autoencoder (RCVAE). Through preprocessing data into a quasi-video format, coupled with customized training and inference algorithms, the RCVAE generates the required charging data in real time based on the battery’s ECL and EOL. This avoids storing irrelevant information, saving space and resources. RCVAE uses a lightweight architecture, enabling fast generation of necessary voltage, current, temperature, and charging capacity data. This approach provides users with a comprehensive electrochemical dataset, pioneering a new research domain for the artificial synthesis of lithium battery data. Furthermore, based on the detailed synthetic data, various battery state indicators can be calculated, offering new perspectives and possibilities for lithium battery performance prediction.}

abstract = {Background
ChatGPT is a natural language processing chatbot with a significant prevalence in modern media with a clear application in the medical triage workflow. ChatGPT has shown significant capacity for understanding clinical vignettes, radiology reports, and even passing the American Board of Neurological Surgery board examination. There has never been an evaluation of the chatbot in triage and diagnosing spinal vignettes common to primary and urgent care practice.
Methods
Fifteen clinical scenarios were created to mimic spinal complaints common to primary and urgent care scenarios. GPT-4 was instructed to assess the situation as if it was in a primary care office and determine diagnosis, imaging recommendations, and if emergency room (ER) or operative referral was necessary. Answers were recorded and the results compared to those of attending and resident respondents.
Results
GPT-4 provided the most likely diagnosis in each scenario. Additionally, it recommended reasonable clinical management of each scenario which would fall within standard practice guidelines. ChatGPT tended toward over-referral to the ER; however, this was not significant. GPT-4 was noninferior in all categories when compared to respondents.
Conclusions
ChatGPT is a powerful tool for primary triage of spinal issues. It can rapidly and accurately evaluate clinical scenarios and provide clear diagnostic reasoning. GPT-4 is not designed for medical use and will provide a disclaimer as such. It did tend toward over-referring patients to the ER. With specific training, it is likely that artificial intelligence and natural language processing chatbots will become widely used in primary triage of spinal issues.}

abstract = {Background
YouTube is an accessible online resource for education-related information. An “intitle:” search modifier uses specific terms to aid in limiting or expanding results. There is limited knowledge on the impact of search modifiers on quality and accuracy of OB/GYN educational instructional videos.
Objective
Our objective is to examine the effect of “intitle:” search modifier on the quality and accuracy of YouTube OB/GYN educational videos.
Study Design
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology(ACOG) /The Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) endorsed the Surgical Curriculum of Obstetrics and Gynecology (SCOG) procedures. This approved procedure list in combination with the search modifier, “intitle:” was used in YouTube search queries. Results were screened with strict exclusion criteria and video characteristics were obtained. Videos were graded on accuracy and quality using a SCOG accuracy checklist and the validated Laparoscopic Surgery Video Educational Guidelines (LAP-VEGaS) video assessment tool. Results were analyzed using ANOVA statistical testing.
Results
A total of 353 videos were screened, 89 were excluded and 264 were analyzed. For videos without asearch modifier, international organizations had highest % accuracy and only international healthcare organization videos met a quality score of 11.2. After using a search modifier, average accuracy and quality scores increased by 33.2% and 38.1%, respectively. Videos with quality scores > 11 included multiple types of organizations (Table 6). The “intitle:” search modifier videos had statistically significant improvement in quality and accuracy separated by likes, views and affiliated organizations (p-value < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in accuracy and quality for the search modifier videos based on the number of subscribers and geographic location.
Conclusion
The user-friendly nature of YouTube allows OB/GYN providers the ability to access and learn from educational videos. Understanding characteristics associated with accurate and quality information ensures proper selection of precise and current educational resources. It is imperative that providers are aware of the importance and enhancement of “intitle:” search modifier when searching for OB/GYN educational content.}

It explores how GAI affects both senders’ ability to create salient messages and receivers’ costs of absorbing them. The analysis reveals that while GAI can increase communication by reducing costs, it may also disrupt traditional signalling mechanisms. In a salience model, GAI generally improves outcomes but can potentially reduce receiver welfare. In a pure signalling model, GAI may hinder effective communication by making it harder to distinguish high-quality messages. This suggests that GAI’s introduction necessitates new instruments and mechanisms to facilitate effective communication and quality assessment in this evolving landscape.}

However, its potential benefits come with compelling ethical and legal risks, necessitating proper guardrails steering AI in beneficial directions. Amid the global race to AI regulation, China has exhibited strong and open ambition in shaping the emerging global AI order. In response to challenges posed by AI, China has not only implemented agile administrative intervention in policy support, central coordination, and investment, but also adopted an AI governance framework that characterized by ‘complexity,’ ‘agility,’ ‘stability,’ and ‘flexibility.’ Nevertheless, while an agile, sector-specific approach to AI governance may yield short-term benefits, it raises long-term concerns, including opaque decision-making, weak enforcement, fragmented oversight, and inadequate protection of fundamental rights. In particular, governance fragmentation marked by overlapping regulatory bodies and layered rulemaking risks producing piecemeal and outdated regulations that struggle to keep pace with rapid technological change. Current interventions often prioritize systemic stability over ethical clarity and robust supervision, while strategic ambiguity further complicates the implementation of AI ethics and hinders effective oversight, whether internal or administrative. Instead of calling for an omnibus AI law that applies a uniform package of rules, Chinese regulators chose to adapt horizontal elements into vertical regulations through a set of bureaucratic know-how and iterative regulatory tools. Through a comparative legal analysis, this paper finds that comprehending the intricacies of China’s AI regulatory approach is vital not only for projecting its future technological progression but also for understanding its impact on international tech competition. Differences in diverse AI governance may offer valuable insights while commonalities in AI governance values and principles hold promises for global cooperation in responsible AI governance. Moreover, it is plausible to expect that China will reconcile existing horizontal regulatory tools in a horizontal legislative package, while the EU AI Act provides valuable practical implications for the transition from vertical AI-related regulations to a horizontal Chinese AI Law, and the decentralized regulatory approach adopted by the U.S. serves as a useful reference for multi-stakeholder and multi-level cooperation. In addition, EU’s rights-driven framework and US’s market-driven model may serve as critical benchmarks, influencing China’s state-driven approach to harmonizing its legislative strategies for a responsive AI regulation.}

The goal was to reduce the workload while also maintaining the transparency and objectivity of the selection process. The algorithms were trained, validated, and tested on a set of 3187 studies on simulation-based learning found in medical and educational databases collected before April 2018. Subsequently, they were utilized to classify abstracts for a follow-up meta-analysis consisting of 2373 studies (published between 2018 and 2020). The aim of training the algorithms was to predict studies’ abstract eligibility based on words and combinations of words used in these abstracts. The application of the algorithms reduced the number of studies that had to be manually screened from 2373 to 711. A total of 458 studies from automatically selected abstracts were included in the full-text screening, indicating the high precision of the algorithms (also compared to the performance of human raters).

abstract = {Medical image generation has recently garnered significant interest among researchers. However, the primary generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), often encounter challenges during training, including mode collapse. To address these issues, we proposed the AE-COT-GAN model (Autoencoder-based Conditional Optimal Transport Generative Adversarial Network) for the generation of medical images belonging to specific categories. The training process of our model comprises three fundamental components. The training process of our model encompasses three fundamental components. First, we employ an autoencoder model to obtain a low-dimensional manifold representation of real images. Second, we apply extended semi-discrete optimal transport to map Gaussian noise distribution to the latent space distribution and obtain corresponding labels effectively. This procedure leads to the generation of new latent codes with known labels. Finally, we integrate a GAN to train the decoder further to generate medical images. To evaluate the performance of the AE-COT-GAN model, we conducted experiments on two medical image datasets, namely DermaMNIST and BloodMNIST. The model’s performance was compared with state-of-the-art generative models. Results show that the AE-COT-GAN model had excellent performance in generating medical images. Moreover, it effectively addressed the common issues associated with traditional GANs.}

abstract = {Background
Gait speed indicates the onset or decline of physical performance in sarcopenia. However, real-time measurements of other gait parameters, such as step length, stride length, step width, and support time, are limited. The advent of wearable technology has facilitated the measurement of these parameters, necessitating further investigation into their potential applications.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between gait parameters measured using wearable sensors and muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in community-dwelling older adults.
Methods
In a cross-sectional study of 91 participants aged ≥65 years, gait parameters, such as step count, step length, cadence, single and double support times, vertical oscillation, and instantaneous vertical loading rate (IVLR), measured using a wireless earbud device, were analyzed on the basis of the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), calf circumference, handgrip strength, 5-time chair stand test, short physical performance battery (SPPB), and the SARC-F (strength, assistance with walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs and fall frequency) questionnaire. This study was conducted from July 10 to November 1, 2023, at an outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Seoul, Korea. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate independent associations after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities.
Results
Among 91 participants (45 men and 46 women; mean age 74.1 years for men and 73.6 years for women), gait speed and vertical oscillation showed negative associations with their performance in the 5-time chair stand test (P<.001) and SARC-F and positive associations with their performance in the SPPB (P<.001). Vertical oscillations were also associated with grip strength (P=.003). Single and double support times were associated with performance in the 5-time chair stand test and SPPB (P<.001). In addition, double support time was associated with SARC-F scores (P<.001). Gait speed, support time, vertical oscillation, and IVLR showed independent associations with performance in the 5-time chair stand test and SPPB (P<.001), both related to muscle strength or physical performance. Gait speed, double support time, and vertical oscillation all had significant associations with SARC-F scores.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated a significant association between gait monitoring using wearable sensors and quantitative assessments of muscle strength and physical performance in older people. Furthermore, this study substantiated the extensive applicability of diverse gait parameters in predicting sarcopenia.}

abstract = {Introduction: In an era where technological advancements in large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms like ChatGPT continually redefine the boundaries of medicine, the advent of Amazon Web Services (AWS) HealthScribe on July 26th, 2023, heralds a transformative moment in healthcare. This HIPAA-eligible generative AI service, capable of transcribing patient-provider conversations and automatically entering them into an electronic health record (EHR) system, represents a profound intersection of technology and medical practice. As this technology permeates clinical settings, addressing associated patient concerns with AI becomes paramount. Although providers may grasp the intricacies of such technology swiftly, patients are likely to harbor concerns. Patients may be unfamiliar with the technology or question its safety. Clear and precise communication will be essential for physicians to ease patient concerns. Our team interviewed forty-eight subjects to survey their understanding, concerns, and opinions on artificial intelligence. We then classified and visually charted their responses. Based on our data, we created a framework for ethical communication physicians can follow when talking to patients about using artificial intelligence in clinical settings. Method: A multidisciplinary team encompassing physicians, advanced practice providers specializing in hematology and oncology, and bioethicists engaged with forty-eight subjects. The study population represented a diverse cross-section of society, differing in aspects such as age, sex assigned at birth, political orientation, education, income, ethnicity, occupation, and religious affiliation. Our investigative process included a structured interview containing twenty-five foundational questions. No personal health information was collected during the questionnaire, and all questions sought only to garner subject opinion. Questions were designed to probe areas of interest such as: (1) the subject's general feelings about AI in healthcare, (2) their familiarity with AI technologies, (3) the existence of any specific concerns, and (4) a deeper exploration of those concerns. The responses were meticulously collected, categorized, and analyzed to discern emergent trends. Results: Our team developed The TRUST Framework based on our research findings by identifying and addressing the three primary concerns with AI in healthcare; transparency, confidentiality, and consent. The data presented a mosaic of varied opinions, with minimal discernible trends correlating with specific demographic attributes. One of the subtle patterns identified pertained to age. Subjects within the 12-35 age bracket demonstrated a familiarity with artificial intelligence, generally expressing indifference rather than concern or enthusiasm. Those aged 35-65 exhibited greater pronounced indifference than any age demographic and revealed an unfamiliarity with existing artificial intelligence tools. Conversely, respondents aged 65 and older expressed the highest level of concern and a prevalent unfamiliarity with the range of available artificial intelligence applications. Conclusion: Effective communication when introducing the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare settings is imperative. This conclusion is based on abstract reasoning and rooted in real-world feedback received from a diverse subject population. Our research revealed that subjects have varying feelings and concerns with artificial intelligence, irrespective of their background. Therefore, avoiding unconscious bias and having a framework for communicating how AI will be used is essential. As the frontier of AI continues to expand, the need for ethical and transparent communication will only grow. This study serves as a call to action for healthcare providers to commit to clear, honest, and empathetic communication about AI's role in patient care. Doing so will promote the overall acceptance of AI in healthcare, subsequently enhancing patient outcomes and alleviating patient concerns by building trust.}

abstract = {Purpose
The 21st Century Cures Act final rule requires that patients have real-time access to their radiology reports, which contain technical language. The objective of this study to was to use a novel system called RadGPT, which integrates concept extraction and a large language model (LLM), to help patients understand their radiology reports.
Methods
RadGPT generated 150 concept explanations and 390 question-and-answer pairs from 30 radiology report impressions from between 2012 and 2020. The extracted concepts were used to create concept-based explanations, as well as concept-based question-and-answer pairs for which questions were generated using either a fixed template or an LLM. Additionally, report-based question-and-answer pairs were generated directly from the impression using an LLM without concept extraction. One board-certified radiologist and four radiology residents rated the material quality using a standardized rubric.
Results
Concept-based LLM-generated questions were of significantly higher quality than concept-based template-generated questions (P < .001). Excluding those template-based question-and-answer pairs from further analysis, nearly all (>95%) of RadGPT-generated materials were rated highly, with at least 50% receiving the highest possible ranking from all five raters. No answers or explanations were rated as likely to affect the safety or effectiveness of patient care. Report-level LLM-based questions and answers were rated particularly highly, with 92% of report-level LLM-based questions and 61% of the corresponding report-level answers receiving the highest rating from all raters.
Conclusions
The educational tool RadGPT generated high-quality explanations and question-and-answer pairs that were personalized for each radiology report, unlikely to produce harmful explanations, and likely to enhance patient understanding of radiology information.}

abstract = {Background
Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population. However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology.
Objective
This study aims to design the IoT-based management of infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous infectious disease surveillance.
Methods
The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to achieve the intended goals.
Results
We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5) transforming patient information into surveillance information.
Conclusions
The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions, we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance, and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems, providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.}

And refrigerant is widely employed in low and medium grade energy utilization and heating ventilation and air conditioning. The refrigerant mixtures can effectively combine the advantages of their components, which plays a key role in decarbonization. As a basic thermophysical property, critical temperature, Tc, plays an important role in thermodynamic calculation and thermodynamics system design. In this work, the structure-property relationship models of Tc for binary refrigerants were established by developing predictive models based on 61 binary refrigerants with 275 sets of experimental Tc data and six machine learning algorithms. Also, specific halogenated groups of refrigerants are used to characterize the components and molecular structures of binary mixtures. The Multiple-layer Perceptron model owns the best fitting and generalization ability with the average deviation is lower than 2 ​%. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed model does not rely on any experimental property data or empirical parameters, and can accurately predict Tc of binary refrigerant mixtures directly from their components and mixing ratios. The present work could be guided in building predictive models for other properties, thereby supporting the development of novel refrigerant mixtures.}

One widely adopted intervention by platforms for addressing falsehoods is applying “warning labels” to posts deemed inaccurate by fact-checkers. Despite a rich literature on correcting misinformation after exposure, much less work has examined the effectiveness of warning labels presented concurrent with exposure. Promisingly, existing research suggests that warning labels effectively reduce belief and spread of misinformation. The size of these beneficial effects depends on how the labels are implemented and the characteristics of the content being labeled. Despite some individual differences, recent evidence indicates that warning labels are generally effective across party lines and other demographic characteristics. We discuss potential implications and limitations of labeling policies for addressing online misinformation.}

Oligo(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether) resins are commonly used owing to their low dielectric constant and high thermal resistance; however, further reduction in dielectric loss tangents is needed for future communication networks. Materials with excellent dielectric properties typically exhibit low polarity and high flammability, presenting a trade-off between dielectric performance and flame retardancy. PMPS-V exhibits thermosetting behavior and an extremely low dielectric-loss tangent (<0.001 at 10 GHz). Owing to its polyphenylene sulfide backbone, PMPS-V meets the UL-94 V-0 flame retardancy standard. Long-term heat resistance testing at 150 °C confirmed minimal degradation in dielectric properties, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. In addition, PMPS-V has a high glass transition temperature and favorable solubility in common solvents such as toluene, making it suitable for printed wiring board applications. These results indicate that PMPS-V is a promising candidate for next-generation low dielectric materials.}

Her brain MRI was significant for type 1 lissencephaly without other radiographical features of cCMV. The patient initially responded to high dose Prednisolone but had relapse of spasms at 9-month-old and required an ACTH course. She later developed generalized tonic seizures and focal impaired awareness seizures. Subsequent whole exome sequencing (WES) trio revealed a de novo PAFAH1B1 (c.405G > A, p.W135*) heterozygous nonsense variant which is pathogenic and thus solved the diagnostic puzzle. This case demonstrates that the absence of cCMV stigmata should raise concern for alternative etiology in cases of lissencephaly and the importance of genetic evaluation for subsequent management and family counseling.}

abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory condition characterised by the formation of granuloma in organs. It can cause end-organ damage and is associated with an elevated risk of mortality [1, 2]. Despite its clinical importance, the epidemiology of sarcoidosis in England is poorly characterised, with a notable lack of published data on its prevalence, and estimates of incidence and mortality that were last calculated two decades ago [3, 4].
Objectives:
This study's objective was to explore contemporary trends in the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of sarcoidosis in England.
Methods:
This research utilised a population-based approach, using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), linking primary care records with secondary care data and death registrations from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Adults aged 18 years or older who contributed data between 2003 and 2023 were included. Sarcoidosis cases were identified through diagnostic codes in primary care records. Age- and sex-standardised incidence and prevalence were calculated. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to compare mortality rates with those of the general population. A control cohort without sarcoidosis was matched within the CPRD, and negative binomial regression was applied to assess differences in all-cause mortality rates between individuals with incident sarcoidosis and their matched counterparts.
Results:
A total of 56,287 patients had a diagnostic code for sarcoidosis between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st 2023. The age and sex-standardised incidence of sarcoidosis was 6.65 per 100,000 person-years in 2003 and 7.73 per 100,000 person-years in 2023 (Figure 1a). Regression demonstrated an annual increase in incidence of 0.10 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 0.06 to 0.14) over the study period. Notable rises in new diagnoses were observed among males and individuals over 60 years old. The prevalence of sarcoidosis using at least one diagnostic code, standardised by age and sex, increased from 168 per 100,000 in 2003 to 231 per 100,000 in 2023. This increase appeared consistent across the study period (Figure 1b). The age-and-sex-standardised all-cause mortality rate among the prevalent population was 9.5 per 1,000 patients in 2003 and 12.2 per 1,000 patients in 2023 (Figure 1c). Over the study period, there was an annual increase in mortality of 0.07 per 1,000 patients (95% CI 0.02 to 0.12). Elevated mortality rates were observed in males [SMR: 1.8 (95% CI: 1.7 to 1.8)] and females [SMR: 2.0 (95% CI: 2.0 to 2.1)], particularly among those aged 30–70 years. Regression models showed significantly higher all-cause mortality in the incident sarcoidosis cohort compared to matched controls [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.73 (95% CI: 1.63 to 1.83)] Figure 1Age and sex standardised incidence, prevalence and mortality of sarcoidosis in England
Conclusion:
The incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis are rising in England, with notable rises amongst males and individuals aged 60 and older. Younger patients with sarcoidosis are at increased risk of death compared to matched controls. Acknowledging the growing burden of this disease, along with shifting demographic trends, is crucial for optimising healthcare policies and ensuring the effective allocation of healthcare resources.

This research explores the benefits and challenges associated with Gen-AI tools for business improvement from the perspective of business players and academicians. Data comprises of interviews with 7 academicians and 10 European industry players. Several benefits were recognized from the use of Gen-AI in business context, mainly resolution of complex situations and operational improvement of processes. At the optimization level, industry players perceived Gen-AI with more potential than academicians. Advantages of Gen-AI were identified as strongly aligned with data quality. Both academicians and industry players highlight difficulty of identification, collection, and update of relevant data, together with the needed parsimony in decision-making about Gen-AI-produced results. This study corroborates the current awareness of scarcity in trained people to explore the full potential of Gen-AI and highlights the resistance towards its adoption by top management, especially in SMEs, which due to their scale may lack structured data and act more risk averse.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, and newly developed models have demonstrated promising potential, yet their diagnostic performance for critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings remains underexplored. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy, differential diagnosis quality, and response quality in critical illness cases of four newly developed LLMs.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, four newly developed LLMs—ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-V3, and DeepSeek-R1—were evaluated using 50 critical illness cases in ICU settings from published literature. Diagnostic accuracy and response quality were compared across models.
Results
A total of 50 critical illness cases were included. ChatGPT-o3 achieved the top diagnosis accuracy at 72 % (36/50; 95 % CI 0.600–0.840), followed by DeepSeek-R1 at 68 % (34/50; 95 % CI 0.540–0.800), ChatGPT-4o at 64 % (32/50; 95 % CI 0.500–0.760), and DeepSeek-V3 at 32 % (16/50; 95 % CI 0.200–0.460). ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT-4o all significantly outperformed DeepSeek-V3, with no significant differences among the three. The median differential quality score was 5.0 for ChatGPT-o3 (IQR 5.0–5.0; 95 % CI 5.0–5.0), DeepSeek-R1 (IQR 5.0–5.0; 95 % CI 5.0–5.0), and ChatGPT-4o (IQR 4.0–5.0; 95 % CI 4.5–5.0), and 4.0 for DeepSeek-V3 (IQR 3.0–5.0; 95 % CI 4.0–5.0). ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 scored significantly higher than DeepSeek-V3; ChatGPT-4o showed a non-significant trend toward better performance.All models received high Likert ratings for response completeness, clarity, and usefulness. ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT-4o each showed a trend toward better response quality compared to DeepSeek-V3, although no significant differences were observed among the models.
Conclusions
The newly developed models, especially the reasoning models, demonstrated strong potential in supporting diagnosis in critical illness cases in ICU settings. With further domain-specific fine-tuning, their diagnostic accuracy could be further enhanced. Notably, the open-source reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 performed competitively, suggesting strong potential for scalable deployment in resource-limited settings.}

CTR prediction hinges on effectively modeling consumers’ product interests based on their historical behavior. However, extant CTR studies have not fully integrated consumer purchase history with other behavior histories such as browsing, adding to cart, and adding to favorites. How should we fully leverage the rich behavior history to extract personal interest and that of similar others? When extracting similar others’ interests, how should we maintain the relevance to personal interests while enjoying the novelty of others’ interests? To address these issues, we conceptualize two types of consumer interest: manifested interests and potentially shared interests when building their interest profile. We propose the Augmented Deep Multi-Behavior Interest Network (ADMBIN) to extract, integrate, and balance the two types of interest from the multi-behavior sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that the ADMBIN outperforms benchmark models in CTR prediction and the contribution of our design components. The proposed model can boost advertising revenue and improve consumer experience.}

abstract = {Objective
Despite an expanding scope of practice, uptake of advanced clinical services is hindered by pharmacists’ self-efficacy in high-stakes decision-making. Traditional experiential learning builds confidence but is constrained by preceptor shortages, scheduling conflicts, and travel requirements. This study evaluates an artificial intelligence-enabled virtual clinical training program designed to replace in-person warfarin-management rotations.
Methods
This mixed-methods study assessed the impact of the Management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy course on learners’ confidence and satisfaction. The course combines online modules with a virtual clinic that simulates a full clinical rotation, including patient encounters, therapeutic decisions, documentation, and structured feedback. Surveys administered after the online modules and again after completing the virtual clinic captured confidence (5-point Likert) and program satisfaction; free-text responses underwent content analysis.
Results
Of 287 participants (96.9% pharmacists), mean confidence on a 5-point Likert scale increased from baseline (1.92) to post-modules (3.85) and further after the virtual clinic (4.24). Approximately 40% experienced additional gains following simulations. Virtual simulations were ranked the most valuable component (69%). Qualitative analysis yielded 4 themes: experiential consolidation of learning, virtual experience comparable to in-person training, complementary role of preparatory materials, and technical refinements needed.
Conclusion
The artificial intelligence-enabled virtual clinic effectively replaced traditional clinical rotations and enhanced confidence in warfarin care. Graduates’ patients later achieved the highest time in therapeutic range reported in Canadian general practice, supporting real-world impact. The Management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy model may mitigate preceptor shortages and deliver standardized experiential training; broader validation across therapeutic areas and learner groups is warranted.}

Existing regression-based prediction methods fail to provide visual postoperative observations, which are essential for a comprehensive risk assessment. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of anterior segment structures. In this work, we pioneer the exploration of using the generative adversarial network to predict postoperative AS-OCT images and quantify the clinical parameter. Given the direct contact between the iris posterior surface and ICL anterior surface, the iris critically influences ICL positioning. Motivated by this, we propose a Prior Anatomical Knowledge-guided GAN (PAK-GAN) to enable both accurate vault prediction and visual observation of postoperative anterior segment structures. Specifically, the Iris morphology perception Auxiliary Branches (IAB) are designed to capture the context of the iris position and shape. Additionally, we incorporate a Gaussian weight map into the loss function to strengthen the model’s attention around the iris root region. To validate the performance of our method, we collected paired pre- and post-operative ICL images from multiple hospitals. Comprehensive ablation experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods show that our PAK-GAN achieves the best prediction accuracy for vault and iris position. Furthermore, compared to two clinically used postoperative vault prediction methods, NK-formula and KS-formula, our approach shows the best correlation and agreement with the achieved vault.}

As BHR is an emerging concept, there is no structured knowledge graph to understand the whole process of BHR under disasters. Therefore, this study aims to build a structured BHR knowledge graph based on multi-modal data, providing sufficient structured knowledge for BHR enhancement. An automated knowledge graph construction approach is proposed to empower the ontology design and triple extraction by large language models (LLMs), and validation processes based on In-context Learning (ICL) prompts. A case study is conducted to construct the knowledge graph of BHR under rainstorms in Hong Kong. The performance of the proposed LLMs-empowered knowledge extraction is also validated based on natural language processing metrics and LLMs-based Evaluation (LLMs-Eval). BHR knowledge graph indicates the potential relations between disasters, factors, response actions, and the health status of the building and occupants, and provides insight to guide the BHR enhancement. The superiority of the proposed LLMs-empowered automated knowledge graph construction approach is proven, implying LLMs have great potential in knowledge graph construction, not only for BHR but also for other concepts that require structured knowledge for further explorations and analyses.}

abstract = {Background
Currarino syndrome is a rare congenital condition characterized by a triad of anorectal malformation, sacral agenesis, and presacral mass, often a teratoma. Comparative outcomes of sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) in Currarino versus non-syndromic cases are not well defined.
Methods
A multicenter retrospective review of pediatric SCT resections from 2010 to 2020 was conducted across 11 institutions in the Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of Currarino syndrome. Demographic, surgical, pathologic, and long-term outcome data were analyzed. The primary outcome was tumor recurrence.
Results
Of 203 patients, 25 (12.3 %) had Currarino syndrome. Currarino patients were more often diagnosed postnatally (80 % vs. 25 %, p < 0.001) and had predominantly Altman type IV tumors (87 % vs. 17 %, p < 0.001). All tumors in the Currarino cohort were mature teratomas, while 27 % of non-Currarino tumors were immature and 12 % were malignant (p < 0.001). Tumors in Currarino patients were significantly smaller in size (median 3.3 cm vs. 8.0 cm, p < 0.001). Recurrence rates were low and comparable (4 % Currarino vs. 10 % non-Currarino, p = 0.18). Currarino patients had higher rates of urinary incontinence (44 % vs. 28 %, p = 0.048) and constipation (76 % vs. 32 %, p < 0.001). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a trend toward improved recurrence-free survival in Currarino patients, though not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Pediatric patients with Currarino-associated SCTs have excellent long-term outcomes, with low recurrence rates likely attributable to benign tumor histology and high rates of complete resection. These findings suggest that surveillance strategies may be tailored for Currarino patients to reduce unnecessary imaging and long-term follow-up burden.

abstract = {Background
Medical education can be challenging for students as they must manage vast amounts of complex information. Traditional mnemonic resources often follow a standardized approach, which may not accommodate diverse learning styles.
Objective
This tutorial presents a student-developed approach to creating personalized multimodal mnemonics (PMMs) using artifical intelligence tools.
Methods
This tutorial demonstrates a structured implementation process using ChatGPT (GPT-4 model) for text mnemonic generation and DALL-E 3 for visual mnemonic creation. We detail the prompt engineering framework, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting techniques. The process involves (1) template development, (2) refinement, (3) personalization, (4) mnemonic specification, and (5) quality control. The implementation time typically ranges from 2 to 5 minutes per concept, with 1 to 3 iterations needed for optimal results.
Results
Through systematic testing across 6 medical concepts, the implementation process achieved an initial success rate of 85%, improving to 95% after refinement. Key challenges included maintaining medical accuracy (addressed through specific terminology in prompts), ensuring visual clarity (improved through anatomical detail specifications), and achieving integration of text and visuals (resolved through structured review protocols). This tutorial provides practical templates, troubleshooting strategies, and quality control measures to address common implementation challenges.
Conclusions
This tutorial offers medical students a practical framework for creating personalized learning tools using artificial intelligence. By following the detailed prompt engineering process and quality control measures, students can efficiently generate customized mnemonics while avoiding common pitfalls. The approach emphasizes human oversight and iterative refinement to ensure medical accuracy and educational value. The elimination of the need for developing separate databases of mnemonics streamlines the learning process.}

Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a “skeletonized” form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data used in the method are publicly available.

Case 1 is an infant who underwent SSA for meconium ileus. He developed progressive malabsorption and was found to have a dilated segment of 9 by 8 cm at the prior SSA. This was narrowed into two lumens. He continues to gain weight appropriately. Case 2 is an infant with compartment syndrome resulting in partial colectomy and small bowel resection. Continuity was restored with SSA. On abdominal exploration years later for persistent abdominal pain, the area of prior SSA measured 14 by 9 cm and was narrowed into two lumens. He has excelled postoperatively. Case 3 and Case 4 are older patients referred after initial resection and SSAs as infants. Both had adequate intestinal length excluding their dilated areas and underwent resection with redo SSA as young adults. Both continue to do well. Case 5 is an ex-premature boy with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and two prior SSAs. He developed chronic pain and underwent resection of dilated intestine with redo SSA. This dilation recurred at the new SSA two years later. He then underwent division back into two lumens. He is now doing well.
Conclusion
In patients undergoing bowel resection, SSA can cause abnormal dilatation requiring narrowing. Based on these outcomes, we caution against SSA in patients with anticipated SBS.}

abstract = {The spiral arm information contained in spiral galaxy images, especially the number of spiral arms, is of great value for studying the structural evolution and dynamics of galaxies. Against the backdrop of explosive growth in galaxy observation data, how to quickly identify the number of spiral arms has become an important issue in the study of spiral galaxies. The research is based on the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey) dataset and studies the ResNet (Residual Networks) model's method of identifying the number of spiral arms from spiral galaxy images. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the ResNet32 model is 83%, which is the best compared to network models such as ViT (Vision Transformer), EfficientNet, and DenseNet. In terms of recognition of different numbers of spiral arms, there is a strong relationship between recognition accuracy and the number of training samples. There are 6800 images with 2 spiral arms, with an F1-Score value of 0.9, while there are only 237 images with 4 spiral arms, with the lowest F1-Score value. The experiment further analyzed the recognition effect of fused traditional galaxy image features and found that the role of fused traditional galaxy image features in improving the recognition of spiral arms is limited.}

However, little is known about how teachers leverage this potential. This study examines the beliefs and reported practices of primary school teachers in Switzerland and Germany regarding their promotion of metacognitive strategies through a digital learning environment (DLE, i.e. LearningView). DLEs offer various technological features that can be used to support students’ planning, monitoring, and reflecting on their learning processes. The aim of the study is to understand the teacher’s role in these aspects through the DLE LearningView. Qualitative content analysis of 20 teacher interviews reveals that most teachers adopt a combined approach to the promotion of metacognitive strategies, utilizing both digital and analog methods. In general, teachers used a greater degree of implicit over explicit promotion activities to promote students’ metacognitive strategies in DLEs. The findings suggest a connection between teachers' beliefs and reported practices and highlight the importance of teachers’ perception of themselves as coaches during learning. Our study underscores the need for teacher training to effectively integrate digital and analog approaches for promoting SRL. Given the rapidly changing learning environments due to digitalization, future research should prioritize exploring adaptive learning technology and the role of digital feedback, employing methodologies such as classroom observations or a quantitative methodological approach. Achieving a balanced interplay between teachers, students, and digital tools seems imperative to optimize metacognitive learning in the 21st century classroom.}

GPT-3 and BERT models expanded their scope from traditional NLP areas to the new realms of screens, audio, images, and video, redefining AI in the process. The future is certain to bring further changes, with prompt engineering likely to become an important skill for making full use of LLMs. By giving clear, context-sensitive, and specific instructions, users can optimize outputs—but issues such as ambiguity, bias, and side effects need to be addressed to ensure that results are ethically sound, accurate, and practical. Just as LLMs continue to move forward, so will the design and best practice of “triggers” change and develop over time. The architecture of LLMs, their training, and their fine-tuning, all based on transformers, attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and encoder-decoder structures, reveals their pros and cons. Computational efficiency should always be the top priority in designing LLMs. Also, there are new development stages to be in the future: in these, propositional knowledge will have more emphasis, and transference both from and between different realms of AI into a new era of intelligent, accountable systems, without which truly likely governance problems may arise.}

abstract = {Introduction
Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has biomechanical advantages but is associated with increased intraoperative bleeding. The role of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing postoperative joint haemarthrosis and improving the short-term outcomes of double-bundle ACLR has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to assess the effects of intraoperative TXA on postoperative joint haemarthrosis and short-term functional outcomes in patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included 80 male patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR between January 2019 and December 2022. The patients were divided into two groups: those who received TXA and those that did not. The TXA group received 50 mL of TXA (10 mg/mL) intravenously approximately 10 min before tourniquet release, followed by an intra-articular injection of 50 mL TXA (10 mg/mL) immediately after wound closure, prior to tourniquet release, whereas the control group did not receive TXA. Primary outcomes included postoperative haemarthrosis volume, assessed using Coupens and Yate (CY) values; and short-term functional recovery, evaluated using range of motion (ROM), quadriceps strength, and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores on day 1, day 15, week 6, and week 12 postoperatively.
Results
Intraoperative administration of TXA in patients undergoing double-bundle ACLR reduced postoperative haemarthrosis, as measured by a lower CY value on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.004) and day 15 (P < 0.001). Compared to patients in the control group, patients in the TXA group reported lower VAS pain scores on day 1 (P < 0.001), day 15 (P < 0.001), and week 6 (P = 0.028), together with improved quadriceps strength (P = 0.043, day 1; P = 0.009, day 15) and ROM (P < 0.001, 12 weeks postoperatively) during the early postoperative period.
Conclusion
The use of TXA during double-bundle ACLR may reduce postoperative joint haemarthrosis and enhance short-term functional outcomes.}

While evasion of the variants from adaptive immunity is widely investigated, there is a paucity of knowledge about their interactions with innate immunity. Inflammasome assembly is one of the most potent mechanisms of the early innate response to viruses, but when it is inappropriate, it can perpetuate tissue damage. In this study, we focused on the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We compared the macrophage activation, particularly the inflammasome formation, using Alpha- and Delta-spike virus-like particles (VLPs). We found that VLPs of both variants activated the inflammasome even without a priming step. Delta-spike VLPs had a significantly stronger effect on triggering pyroptosis and inflammasome assembly in THP-1 macrophages than did Alfa-spike VLPs. Cells treated with Delta VLPs showed greater cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β release. Furthermore, Delta VLPs induced stronger cytokine secretion from macrophages and caused essential impairment of mitochondrial respiration in comparison to Alpha VLPs. Additionally, infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages with the SARS-CoV-2 variants confirmed the observations in VLPs. Collectively, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Delta had a greater impact on the inflammasome activation, cell death and mitochondrial respiration in macrophages than did the Alpha variant. Importantly, the differential response to the SARS-CoV-2 variants can influence the efficacy of therapies targeting the host's innate immunity.}

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising for drug delivery due to their high drug-loading capacity, tunable porosity, and structural diversity. However, their clinical translation is hindered by concerns over biocompatibility. Unfortunately, experiments are resource and time intensive, while modeling approaches fail to capture the behavior of MOFs in intricate biological systems. Herein, we report a machine learning (ML)-guided computational pipeline for probing MOF biocompatibility. Using a database of over 35,000 organic molecules, our interpretable ML models predict the toxicity of MOF linkers with over 80% accuracy across different administration routes. Furthermore, we cataloged the toxicity of MOF metallic centers and screened 86,000 MOFs from the Cambridge Structural Database, identifying candidates with minimal toxicity profiles. Beyond screening, our models provide insights into chemical features of biocompatible MOFs—enabling de novo rational design. This framework expedites the discovery of safer MOFs for drug delivery and deepens the understanding of their underlying chemistry.}

abstract = {Introduction
Enhanced Recovery Pathways (ERP) have gained popularity for optimizing perioperative care, improving patient outcomes, and reducing hospital stays. While extensively studied in adult populations, ERPs in pediatric patients, especially for thyroid surgeries, are uncommon. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an ERP designed for pediatric patients undergoing single-lobe thyroidectomy.
Methods
This prospective study was conducted at Nationwide Children's Hospital from January 2023 to December 2024 and involved children 8 years of age or older undergoing single lobe thyroidectomy. Patients with significant comorbid conditions or undergoing total thyroidectomy were excluded. The ERP incorporated standardized preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. Outcome measures were postoperative pain, incidence of postoperative nausea, time to discharge, and patient/parent satisfaction. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results
16 patients were included, predominantly female (81.3 %, n = 13), ranging in age from 8 to 17 years. The median surgical time was 63 min (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 56.5, 75). Following surgery, patients spent a median of 60 min (IQR: 43, 63.5) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and 217 min (IQR: 189, 260) in the transitional care unit (TCU) before discharge. Adherence to the ERP was high, with 100 % compliance to the order set. 81 % of patients experienced no nausea or vomiting in the PACU/TCU. A single patient required an extended stay due to postoperative nausea, for same-day discharge success rate of 93.8 %. Post-discharge, 93.8 % of patients reported no nausea, and pain was effectively managed without opioid use in 68.8 % of patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No patients required readmission, and all reported high satisfaction with the care received on post-operative satisfaction survey (mean score = 5/5).
Discussion
Implementation of a pediatric ERP for single-lobe thyroidectomy was successful in promoting same-day discharge, effective pain control without opioids, healthcare utilization management, high patient satisfaction. These findings suggest that ERPs can be safely and effectively adapted for select pediatric thyroid surgery, potentially setting a new standard for perioperative care in this population.

Latent growth curve analyses revealed distinct developmental patterns: socioeconomic disparities were initially large (Cohen's d = −0.22) but decreased over time (Cohen's d = −0.16); gender differences favoring boys were small at first (Cohen's d = 0.07) but widened during adolescence (Cohen's d = 0.18); and the migrant gap was already substantial in early adolescence (Cohen's d = −0.18) and remained stable later on. Comparative analyses for math and reading literacy highlighted partial parallels between digital inequalities and traditional educational inequalities. Overall, the results indicated persistent social, gender, and migration-related disparities in digital competencies throughout adolescence. Because these gaps remained considerable in later adolescence, they appear insufficiently addressed by the current educational system. To reduce digital inequalities, educational interventions may need to begin even before adolescence and target younger children in order to prevent disparities from becoming firmly established.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of FENa (Fractional excretion of sodium), FEK (fractional excretion of potassium) and uSID (urinary strong ion difference) in predicting pAKI in sepsis and septic shock.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
Two intensive care units in Argentina.
Patients
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and AKI, and had a urinary biochemistry within 24h of the AKI diagnosis.
Interventions
None.
Main variables of interest
We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FENa, FEK and uSID through a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis.
Results
80 patients were included. 40 patients presented pAKI. pAKI group had higher APACHE, SOFA score, and mortality rate. In the ROC curve analysis, uSID had no diagnostic utility (AUC=0.52, p=0.69). FENa presented moderate accuracy showing an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60−0.83; p=0.001), while FEK presented low accuracy with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.57−0.80; p=0.04). The optimal Youden point for identifying pAKI was at a FENa higher than 0.51 % with a specificity of 72.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%. In the case of FEK, a value higher than 21.9 % presented the best relation, with a specificity of 67.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%.
Conclusions
urine biochemistry interpretation in septic patients must be revised. FENa and FEK are related to the severity of AKI and could be helpful complementary tools for diagnosing pAKI.
Resumen
Objetivo
Evaluar la utilidad diagnóstica de la Excreción fraccional de Sodio (FENa), Excreción fraccional de potasio (FEK) y uSID (diferencia de aniones fuertes urinaria) en el diagnóstico de la IRA persistente (IRAp).
Ámbito
2 unidades de cuidados intensivos en Argentina.
Pacientes
Adultos con diagnóstico de sepsis o shock séptico e injuria renal aguda (IRA) y disponibilidad de una bioquímica urinaria dentro de las 24hs del diagnóstico de la IRA.
Intervención
Ninguna.
Variables de interés principales
Evaluamos la capacidad diagnóstica de la FENa y FEK y la brecha aniónica urinaria mediante un análisis de la curva ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic).
Resultados
Se incluyeron 40 pacientes en cada grupo (IRAp vs transitoria). Los pacientes con IRAp tuvieron mayor APACHE, SOFA y mortalidad. En el análisis de las curvas ROC, la uSID no demostró utilidad diagnóstica (AUC=0.52). La FENa presentó moderada precisión con un AUC de 0.71 (IC95% 0.60–0.83), mientras que la FEK tuvo un AUC de 0.69 (IC95% 0.57−0.80). El punto de Youden para diferenciar IRAp para la FENa fue de 0.51% con una sensibilidad de 65.0% y una especificidad de 72.5%. En el caso de la FEK, el punto óptimo fue de 21.9% con una sensibilidad de 65.0% y una especificidad de 67.5%.
Conclusiones
La interpretación de la bioquímica urinaria en pacientes sépticos debe ser revisada. La FENa y FEK están relacionados con la severidad de la IRA y pueden ser herramientas diagnósticas complementarias de utilidad.}

To systematically define humanizing health care to guide systems improvements that better meet patient and health care workers’ needs.
Participants and Methods
We conducted group concept mapping at Johns Hopkins Medicine, a large academic health system with five hospitals in Maryland and Washington, DC, outpatient practices, telemedicine, and homecare services. From October 2023 to May 2024, we recruited participants who brainstormed to the focus prompt: “One thing that can be done to more fully humanize healthcare experiences is:” The study team synthesized ideas for participants to sort them. Group concept mapping software generated cluster maps, which were interpreted by the study team to generate the concept map.
Results
In brainstorming, 63 individuals participated, including those with the perspectives of patients (n=40, 63%), caregivers (n=25, 40%), physicians (n=23, 37%), other types of health care professionals (n=14, 22%), health professions educators (n=28, 44%), and health care researchers (n=25, 40%). The 395 statements from brainstorming were synthesized into 207 ideas for sorting, which was completed by 13 participants. The final concept map included eight domains and 32 subdomains. Domains addressed: (1) effective communication, (2) health care worker attitudes, (3) health care culture, (4) health care worker community, (5) institutional policies and health care value, (6) physical and digital systems and access to care, (7) time and attention for patients, and (8) embedding patient perspectives throughout health care.
Conclusion
Health care is fundamentally about human experiences. This concept map, generated by individuals representing the perspectives of a variety of individuals involved in health care, offers guidance for interventions and measures to make health care more humanizing.}

We compared the Spring and Fall administration pass rates of initial primary certification candidates for those who graduated in the same year they took the examination. We also compared the pass rates of same-year graduates with individuals who postponed the examination for a year or more. We also surveyed the candidates regarding the reasons they chose the Spring or Fall administration. Candidates who chose the earlier (i.e., Spring) administration were more likely to pass compared with those who took the later Fall administration (p = 0.0026 for Anatomic Pathology; p = 0.0004 for Clinical Pathology). Delaying the certifying exams beyond the calendar year of residency graduation was associated with a higher failure rate (p < 0.0001 for both Anatomic and Clinical Pathology). The survey results suggest that residents often take their certification examinations earlier to not interfere with fellowship training, because it coincides with the completion of residency training, or it is expected by their program. Pathology residents are more likely to pass the primary certification examinations when they are taken closer to the end of training, rather than postponing it to a later administration. Pathology residency program directors should encourage residents, who are deemed ready, to take their certification examinations at the earliest possible administration.}

Recently, we found that suppression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) exhibits renoprotective effects in acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The present study investigated the hypothesis that temporal suppression of SPARC in the early stages of I/R-injury might lead to the prevention of renal injury in the chronic phase. The left renal pedicle of male BALB/c mice was occluded for 45 min after right uninephrectomy and subsequently reperfused for 28 days. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting SPARC was injected intravenously 1 day before and 3 days after I/R. Histological assessment revealed that SPARC knockdown by siRNA attenuated tubular injury, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and the overexpression of 4-hydroxynonenal, a marker of lipid peroxidation. I/R-induced overexpression of a major source of superoxide NADPH oxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was suppressed by siRNA targeting SPARC. Treatment with siRNA targeting SPARC reduced the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS1), which colocalizes with SPARC. In conclusion, SPARC might be a potential therapeutic target for preventing CKD development following acute I/R injury.}

To overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on multi-view input and depth estimation, we propose a multi-view synthesis method for Chinese landscape paintings, termed MVSM-CLP. The proposed CLPDepth Module employs a high-low resolution fusion mechanism to enhance detail expression while preserving the original scene structure. We introduce an image restoration technique guided by landscape ink lines, termed LInpainting, to improve edge extraction and the accuracy of painting inpainting Additionally, our method tackles the issue of scarce 3D data in current view synthesis efforts by constructing multi-view data from a single ancient painting. Our approach effectively bridges the gap between 2D art and 3D visualization, creating vivid and realistic virtual environments while preserving the traditional style and essence of Chinese paintings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving high-quality multi-view synthesis, offering new possibilities for the digital preservation of cultural heritage.

Surgical consent forms convey critical information; yet, their complex language can limit patient comprehension. Large language models (LLMs) can simplify complex information and improve readability, but evidence of the impact of LLM-generated modifications on content preservation in non-English consent forms is lacking.
Objective
This study evaluates the impact of LLM-assisted editing on the readability and content quality of surgical consent forms in Korean—particularly consent documents for standardized liver resection—across multiple institutions.
Methods
Standardized liver resection consent forms were collected from 7 South Korean medical institutions, and these forms were simplified using ChatGPT-4o. Thereafter, readability was assessed using KReaD and Natmal indices, while text structure was evaluated based on character count, word count, sentence count, words per sentence, and difficult word ratio. Content quality was analyzed across 4 domains—risk, benefit, alternative, and overall impression—using evaluations from 7 liver resection specialists. Statistical comparisons were conducted using paired 2-sided t tests, and a linear mixed-effects model was applied to account for institutional and evaluator variability.
Results
Artificial intelligence–assisted editing significantly improved readability, reducing the KReaD score from 1777 (SD 28.47) to 1335.6 (SD 59.95) (P<.001) and the Natmal score from 1452.3 (SD 88.67) to 1245.3 (SD 96.96) (P=.007). Sentence length and difficult word ratio decreased significantly, contributing to increased accessibility (P<.05). However, content quality analysis showed a decline in the risk description scores (before: 2.29, SD 0.47 vs after: 1.92, SD 0.32; P=.06) and overall impression scores (before: 2.21, SD 0.49 vs after: 1.71, SD 0.64; P=.13). The linear mixed-effects model confirmed significant reductions in risk descriptions (β₁=−0.371; P=.01) and overall impression (β₁=−0.500; P=.03), suggesting potential omissions in critical safety information. Despite this, qualitative analysis indicated that evaluators did not find explicit omissions but perceived the text as overly simplified and less professional.
Conclusions
Although LLM-assisted surgical consent forms significantly enhance readability, they may compromise certain aspects of content completeness, particularly in risk disclosure. These findings highlight the need for a balanced approach that maintains accessibility while ensuring medical and legal accuracy. Future research should include patient-centered evaluations to assess comprehension and informed decision-making as well as broader multilingual validation to determine LLM applicability across diverse health care settings.}

abstract = {Background
Active tuberculosis drug-safety monitoring and management (aDSM) is recommended in the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. We established comprehensive aDSM and conducted a nationwide multicenter prospective study in Taiwan.
Methods
We designed a treatment initiation form to capture characteristics of patients at baseline, a treatment review form to monitor symptoms, blood tests, QT intervals, and audiometry during treatment, and an adverse event report form for reporting severe adverse events (grade 3 or more), serious adverse events and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Severity of adverse events were categorized by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03, and causality was assessed by using the World Health Organization – Uppsala Monitoring Centre system.
Results
Of 333 patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis enrolled from May 2017 to February 2020, 329 (98.8 %) had adverse events and 196 (58.9 %) had severe adverse events during treatment. The top three severe adverse events were metabolism disorders (104, 31.2 %), hearing impairment (102, 30.6 %), and hepatotoxicity (64, 19.2 %). Of 403 severe adverse events reported, 284 (70.5 %) were classified as drug-related. The top five drugs associated with severe adverse events were bedaquiline (27.6 %), clofazimine (26.7 %), kanamycin (25.1 %), pyrazinamide (22.4 %) and linezolid (22.2 %). Forty-four (13.2 %) patients were hospitalized and 15 (4.5 %) had prolonged hospitalization due to adverse events. One death was considered drug-related.
Conclusion
Severe adverse events in the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis were more frequent than previously reported and needed to be closely monitored and timely managed by systematic and comprehensive aDSM.}

keywords = {Overdose prevention, Opioid use, withdrawal, Drug Testing},
abstract = {Background and Objectives
In the past decade, the increasing availability and prevalence of fentanyl in the drug supply have heightened the risk of fatal overdose and increased the frequency and severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms. We aimed to examine how opioid withdrawal impacts engagement in harm reduction behaviors among people who use drugs.
Methods
Data came from a community-based research study in Baltimore, Maryland, conducted from 2022-2024. Participants were adults who used heroin, fentanyl, or prescription opiates to get high in the past month (N=676). Structured surveys assessed withdrawal as a barrier to testing drugs for potency and overdose prevention. Logistic regression models were used to identify correlates of engagement in harm reduction during periods of withdrawal.
Results
Half the sample (46.6%) reported that withdrawal “always” or “often” prevented them from testing drugs, and 66.6% agreed that withdrawal was a barrier to overdose prevention. Depression symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.56, 95% CI 1.09-2.25), increased opioid use per week (aOR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22), and White race (aOR: 1.75, 95% CI 1.16-2.62) were independently associated with lower engagement in drug testing and overdose prevention during withdrawal.
Conclusions
Withdrawal significantly impacts engagement in harm reduction behaviors, even among those with high awareness and receptivity to drug testing and overdose prevention strategies. Withdrawal management and mental health support are emergent and critical components for harm reduction interventions to prevent overdose morbidity and mortality among people who use drugs.}

abstract = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis because it can characterize tissue based on contrast agent kinetics. Conventional DCE-MRI protocols require multiple imaging phases, including both early and late post-contrast acquisitions, leading to prolonged scanning times that can cause patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and contribute to higher costs and limited availability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive pipeline for synthesizing long-term (late-phase) contrast-enhanced breast MRI images from short-term (early-phase) counterparts, aiming to replicate the behavior of the time-intensity (TI) curve in enhanced regions while maintaining visual properties across the entire image. The proposed approach introduces a new loss function called the Time Intensity Loss (TI-loss), which leverages the temporal behavior of the contrast agent to guide the training of a generative model. Furthermore, as established normalization strategies show undesirable effects on the enhancement behavior, a novel normalization strategy (TI-norm) is also proposed, which preserves the contrast enhancement pattern across multiple image sequences at various timestamps. Additionally, two new metrics are proposed to evaluate the synthesized image quality, i.e., the Contrast agent Pattern score (CPs), which determines the validity of annotated regions according to their enhancement patterns (plateau, persistent, washout), and the average difference in enhancement (ED), which quantifies the difference between the real and generated enhancement in selected regions. Evaluation was performed using a public DCE-MRI dataset that includes studies from 3T and 1.5T scanners with different imaging techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method accurately synthesizes the contrast enhancement response in terms of the TI curve in regions of interest and significantly outperforms other models, while maintaining visual properties comparable to real late-phase contrast-enhanced images. By enabling accurate synthesis of late-phase contrast-enhanced images from early-phase data, our method has the potential to optimize DCE-MRI protocols, reducing scanning time without compromising diagnostic accuracy. This advancement brings generative models closer to practical implementation in clinical scenarios, enhancing efficiency in breast cancer imaging.}

Because academic research on the integration of artificial intelligence and ideological and political education is lacking, the progress in practical applications is slow. To address this gap, this study took disciplinary system theory as the analytical framework, knowledge sociology as the theoretical perspective, and the Chinese literature database as the source, using data visualization software CiteSpaceVI to examine the knowledge production situation in the combination of artificial intelligence and ideological and political education in China. Through word segmentation technology and cluster analysis, this study found that research in this field began in 2018 and peaked in 2021 and 2023; scholars from more than 10 different disciplines participated in the research, and five stable research areas were formed. This field of study received support from 45 national funds and 29 funds from the Ministry of Education, along with various provincial fund projects. As a result, there are many urgent issues in this field waiting for more in-depth research and exploration in the future.}

Traditional manual design process is costly and time-consuming, while optimization methods heavily depend on expert knowledge. Recent advancements in deep generative models present promising alternatives. However, their application to the generation of prefabricated construction site layouts is hindered by several challenges, including limited datasets, significant overlap between facilities, and the necessity to generate layouts based on fixed facilities with specific attributes such as minimal transportation costs. These challenges constrain the efficacy and applicability of the generated layouts. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative automated generative design system for prefabricated construction site layouts, leveraging a novel Transformer-based conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). The data preparation module of the system collects and augments layout data for training. The CSLGAN module is designed to generate layouts that conform to spatial constraints and desired attributes, with minimal facility overlap. Furthermore, this study establishes benchmarks in terms of model capacity and specialized performance metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in automated construction site layout generation.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chemotherapy can induce a range of unpleasant adverse effects, with oral mucositis being one of the most common. This condition significantly impacts patients' quality of life and can disrupt their adherence to treatment protocols. Oral mucositis serves as an important limiting factor in chemotherapy, often necessitating dose reductions or treatment delays, which in turn can compromise the overall effectiveness of the therapy. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of melatonin mouthwash on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.
Methods
Following the preparation of melatonin and placebo mouthwashes, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients with solid tumor malignancies who had no oral lesions and were treated with chemotherapy regimens. The patients began using the mouthwash on the first day of their corresponding chemotherapy course, continuing for six weeks with a frequency of three times daily, 4mL per application. At the end of each week, the patients were evaluated for the severity and duration of mucositis, as well as the associated pain. Quality of life was assessed at the study's start and weekly thereafter.
Results
Seventy patients were randomized into melatonin (n = 35) and placebo (n = 35) groups. The melatonin group had a lower incidence of mucositis (11.43 % versus 34.28 %), with a relative risk of 0.74 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.56 to 0.96). The severity of mucositis showed statistically significant differences between the melatonin and placebo groups at the end of the fifth week (P = 0.003) and the sixth week (P = 0.002). Additionally, the intensity of pain caused by mucositis demonstrated statistically significant differences at the end of the third week (P = 0.021), the fifth week (P = 0.001), and the sixth week (P = 0.001). There was also a significant difference in the overall duration of mucositis between the melatonin and placebo groups (mean difference -8.83, 95 %CI: -14.54 to -3.12). The mouthwash was well tolerated in both groups.
Conclusion
The findings of this study suggest that melatonin mouthwash is effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced mucositis. A six-week regimen of melatonin mouthwash significantly reduces the severity and duration of mucositis, as well as the associated pain intensity.}

The gold standard method for diagnosing low bone mineral density (BMD) is using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) however, most patients with low BMD are often not screened. We aimed to create a deep learning (DL) model to screen for osteoporosis/osteopenia in patients by using radiographs of the foot or ankle.
Method
This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients aged ≥50 years who received X-rays of the foot or ankle and DXA (gold-standard) within 12 months. The 907 (White (96.7 %), Black (1.8 %) and Asian (0.4 %)) patients (3109 radiographs) were randomized (80:20) into training/validation and test datasets, and results were assessed by patient. We developed a novel DL model that extracted deep features from the radiographs of the foot and ankle using a customized architecture. The diagnostic performance of this DL model to predict if a patient had low BMD (osteopenic/osteoporotic) or normal BMD based on DXA, was evaluated with the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).
Results
Mean patient age (standard deviation) was 66.9(9.0) years, and 84.6 % were female. 81.3 % and 18.7 % of patients in the training/validation dataset, and 81.5 % and 18.5 % of patients in the test datasets were osteopenic/osteoporotic and normal respectively. The DL model had an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI (0.85, 0.94), sensitivity of 89.89 %, specificity of 83.65 %, PPV of 90.78 % and NPV of 74.14 % in the test dataset. The model had an accuracy of 94.65 % in the training/validation dataset and 89.89 % in the test datasets.
Conclusion
Our DL model has the potential to identify patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis using foot or ankle radiographs with high accuracy.}

abstract = {Introduction
Medical reports contain critical information and require concise language, yet often display errors despite advances in digital tools. This study compared the effectiveness of ChatGPT 4.0 in reporting orthographic, grammatical, and content errors in German neurology reports to a human expert.
Materials and Methods
Ten neurology reports were embedded with ten linguistic errors each, including typographical and grammatical mistakes, and one significant content error. The reports were reviewed by ChatGPT 4.0 using three prompts: (1) check the text for spelling and grammatical errors and report them in a list format without altering the original text, (2) identify spelling and grammatical errors and generate a revised version of the text, ensuring content integrity, (3) evaluate the text for factual inaccuracies, including incorrect information and treatment errors, and report them without modifying the original text. Human control was provided by an experienced medical secretary. Outcome parameters were processing time, percentage of identified errors, and overall error detection rate.
Results
Artificial intelligence (AI) accuracy in error detection was 35% (median) for Prompt 1 and 75% for Prompt 2. The mean word count of erroneous medical reports was 980 (SD = 180). AI-driven report generation was significantly faster than human review (AI Prompt 1: 102.4 s; AI Prompt 2: 209.4 s; Human: 374.0 s; p < 0.0001). Prompt 1, a tabular error report, was faster but less accurate than Prompt 2, a revised version of the report (p = 0.0013). Content analysis by Prompt 3 identified 70% of errors in 34.6 seconds.
Conclusions
AI-driven text processing for medical reports is feasible and effective. ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated strong performance in detecting and reporting errors. The effectiveness of AI depends on prompt design, significantly impacting quality and duration. Integration into medical workflows could enhance accuracy and efficiency. AI holds promise in improving medical report writing. However, proper prompt design seems to be crucial.

Zusammenfassung
Einleitung
Arztbriefe enthalten wichtige Informationen und erfordern eine präzise Sprache. Sie weisen jedoch trotz Fortschritten in der modernen Textbearbeitung häufig Fehler auf. Unsere Studie vergleicht die Effektivität von ChatGPT 4.0 bezüglich der Identifikation und Korrektur orthografischer, grammatikalischer und inhaltlicher Fehler in deutschen neurologischen Arztbriefen mit dem Korrekturlesen durch eine medizinisch versierte Fachkraft.
Material und Methoden
Zehn neurologische Musterarztbriefe wurden jeweils mit zehn sprachlichen Fehlern, darunter orthografische und grammatikalische Fehler, sowie einem schwerwiegenden inhaltlichen Fehler versehen. Die Überprüfung durch ChatGPT 4.0 erfolgte anhand dreier unterschiedlicher Eingabeaufforderungen (Prompts): (1) Identifikation von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit tabellarischer Auflistung der Fehler, ohne den Originaltext zu verändern, (2) Erkennung von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit anschließender Erstellung einer überarbeiteten Textversion unter Wahrung der inhaltlichen Integrität, (3) Überprüfung des Textes auf inhaltliche Ungenauigkeiten, einschließlich fehlerhafter Informationen und Behandlungsfehler, mit Fehlerbericht ohne entsprechende Textmodifikation. Als Kontrolle diente eine erfahrene medizinische Schreibkraft. Die Evaluationsparameter umfassten die Bearbeitungszeit, den prozentualen Anteil erkannter Fehler sowie die Gesamtfehlererkennungsrate.
Ergebnisse
Die Fehlererkennungsgenauigkeit der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) betrug für Prompt 1 im Median 35% und für Prompt 2 im Median 75%. Die durchschnittliche Länge der fehlerhaften Arztbriefe lag bei 980 Wörtern (SD = 180). Die KI-basierte Fehleranalyse erfolgte signifikant schneller als die menschliche Korrektur (KI Prompt 1: 102,4 s; KI Prompt 2: 209,4 s; Mensch: 374,0 s; p < 0,0001). Während Prompt 1 als tabellarischer Fehlerbericht schneller, jedoch weniger präzise war, erwies sich Prompt 2 mit einer überarbeiteten Textversion als genauer (p = 0,0013). Die inhaltliche Analyse durch Prompt 3 identifizierte 70% der Fehlinformationen in 34,6 s.
Schlussfolgerungen
Die KI-gestützte Textüberprüfung für Arztbriefe ist schon jetzt praktikabel und effektiv. ChatGPT 4.0 zeigte gute Leistungen mit einer schnellen Fehlererkennung und Fehlerberichterstattung. Die Effektivität der KI hängt maßgeblich vom Prompt-Design ab, das Qualität und Bearbeitungsdauer signifikant beeinflusst. Eine Integration solcher Tools in die Arztbriefschreibung hat das Potenzial, die Genauigkeit und Effizienz des Prozesses zu steigern. KI-Unterstützung stellt daher eine vielversprechende Möglichkeit zur Verbesserung von Arztbriefen dar. Eine smarte Promptgestaltung erscheint auch bei dieser Aufgabe für große Sprachmodelle (LLM) entscheidend zu sein. Durch die Einbindung von KI können die Supervision und die Qualitätskontrolle in der medizinischen Dokumentation erheblich verbessert werden.}

abstract = {Summary
In an age where technology is evolving at a sometimes incomprehensibly rapid pace, the liver community must adjust and learn to embrace breakthroughs with an open mind in order to benefit from potentially transformative influences on our science and practice. The Journal of Hepatology has responded to novel developments in artificial intelligence (AI) by recruiting experts in the field to serve on the Editorial Board. Publications introducing novel AI technology are no longer uncommon in our journal and are among the most highly debated and possibly practice-changing papers across a broad range of scientific disciplines, united by their focus on liver disease. As AI is rapidly evolving, this expert paper will focus on educating our readership on large language models and their possible impact on our research practice and clinical outlook, outlining both challenges and opportunities in the field. “To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” ― Winston S. Churchill}
