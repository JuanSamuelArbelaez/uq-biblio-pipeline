abstract = {The proposed paper presents a methodology for mapping electronic manufacturing control processes within a Knowledge Management (KM) framework, aligning with human-centric and transdisciplinary approaches. Specifically, the paper explores a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) process for tuning production machinery, facilitating quality management and predictive maintenance through an AI-driven model. The PID circuit model is designed using the LTspice tool, while the entire production workflow is structured according to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. The model incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize machine control, establishing an advanced Digital Twin (DT) model that enables interactive human-system collaboration. The work further describes Knowledge Base (KB) data sources that support KM within Industry 5.0 environments, emphasizing AI-enhanced, user-centered control systems. Finally, the paper discusses new managerial roles and skill sets necessary for overseeing these integrated, human-centric KM systems in next-generation industrial applications.}

abstract = {Purpose
To investigate the incidence, timing, dimensional features, and spatial characteristics of telangiectatic capillaries (TelCaps) in retinal vein occlusion (RVO) patients treated with anti-VEGF monotherapy.
Design
Prospective nonconcurrent cohort study.
Participants
One hundred thirty-eight eyes of 138 patients with treatment-naive RVO treated with anti-VEGF monotherapy for a minimum of 24 months.
Methods
Telangiectatic capillaries were identified using multimodal imaging, including indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), OCT, and color fundus photography. Recurrence of venous occlusive events was defined by new onset of retinal hemorrhages accompanied by worsening of macular edema. Cox regression modeling was used to assess risk factors for TelCap development.
Main Outcome Measures
Telangiectatic capillaries' incidence, dimensional features, spatial distribution, and association with RVO recurrence events.
Results
Over 4.4 ± 2.6 years of follow-up, TelCaps developed in 15/138 eyes (10.9%) after 26 ± 16 months. Telangiectatic capillaries in hemispheric and central RVO showed larger diameters compared with branch RVO (277 ± 44 μm vs. 196 ± 43 μm, P = 0.005) and preferential localization along the temporal horizontal raphe (y-axis coordinates: 0.4 ± 0.6 mm vs. 0.9 ± 0.7 mm, P = 0.017). The recurrence of RVO during follow-up was significantly associated with TelCap development (hazard ratio = 8.74, 95% confidence limit = 2.92–26.2, P < 0.001). At 5-year follow-up, the risk of developing TelCaps was ∼9% in patients without recurrence and ∼55% in those patients with recurrence.
Conclusions
Telangiectatic capillaries occur in approximately 10% of RVO cases undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapy, with distinct characteristics based on RVO subtype. The strong association with disease recurrence suggests episodes of increased venous obstruction contribute to TelCap formation. Extended follow-up and vigilant screening are recommended; when TelCaps are suspected, ICGA can confirm the diagnosis and guide adjunctive targeted treatment.

Current treatment options, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted drugs, have limitations, such as significant side effects, drug resistance, and high cost. To overcome these challenges, extensive studies have explored the anticancer potential of various drugs such as clotrimazole (CLZ), which has shown promising anticancer effects. CLZ was first developed as an antifungal agent. Recently significant anticancer effects have been observed making it a suitable candidate for drug repurposing. Compared with other azole-based antifungals, CLZ has shown distinct therapeutic effects on cancer cells via several pathways. Its ability to disrupt glycolysis by inhibiting phosphofructokinase (PFK) and hexokinase (HK) distinguishes it from other azoles. Furthermore, CLZ obstructs calcium homeostasis and critical survival pathways, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-p65, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, inhibiting tumor growth, inducing apoptosis, and attenuating metastasis. This review explores the potential of repurposing CLZ in cancer and its well-established safety profile and cost-effectiveness to highlight current treatment gaps. It briefly examines in vitro and in vivo assessments to understand the mechanisms and effects of CLZ on various cancer types. Furthermore, novel strategies such as nanoformulations and combination therapies with existing chemotherapeutic drugs have been highlighted to improve therapeutic outcomes. Preclinical studies have provided promising evidence for the efficacy of CLZ in different cancers, showing tumor regression and improved responses to conventional chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Given its evident preclinical results and diverse mechanisms of action, CLZ may be considered an antineoplastic agent. Further clinical research is required to fully elucidate its anticancer potential, potentially positing it as a valuable addition to currently available cancer treatments.}

This study assessed municipal wastewater systems across all 645 municipalities in the state of São Paulo using the most up-to-date data available (from the Sewage Atlas, 2015–2016). Daily potential nutrient loads were estimated at 327.48 t (N) and 40.93 t (P). The 768 Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) mainly served small municipalities (≤50,000 inhabitants) in isolated, centralized systems. Stabilization ponds were common in municipalities with populations up to 100,000 inhabitants, while aerobic reactors and activated sludge systems dominated in larger municipalities. Most WWTPs operated below 80 % capacity utilization, with many medium/large plants below 70 %. Secondary treatment was most common, with average expected nutrient removal efficiencies of 56.5 % for N and 37.3 % for P. Due to low efficiencies and limited coverage (64.8 %), modest reductions in residual loads were observed (36.9 % for N and 25.2 % for P). Despite the statistically significant difference between potential and residual loads, substantial discharges into receiving water bodies (206.53 t N and 30.60 t P daily) persist, leading to frequent exceedances of regulatory standards. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive strategies to expand wastewater treatment coverage and efficiency, and mitigate pollution from untreated and non-point sources.}

The cross-sectional survey included validated measures of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, environmental stressors, resource loss, and demographics. The results indicated significantly higher levels of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress in residents of high-vulnerability areas compared to moderate or low-vulnerability regions. Resource loss served as a mediating variable between environmental stressors and mental health outcomes. Furthermore, demographic analyses showed that older adults and women reported higher levels of psychological distress. These findings align with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, highlighting urgent need for targeted mental health interventions and sustainable models of care in coastal areas increasingly threatened by sea-level rise.}

Further the antimicrobial resistance profile of E. coli and Vibrio species isolated from these samples were also tested. A very high number (more than three thousand gene copies per gram of plastic litter) of Escherichia coli, and Vibrio spp. were detected in the plastic litter. Vibrio spp. in the plastic litter were identified as V. harveyi, V. neocaledonicus, V. japonicus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. campbelli. More than sixty percentage of E. coli and Vibrio spp. isolated from all samples except the E. coli isolated from fishing gear of Kavaratti had multiple antibiotic resistance index of more than 0.25. Most of the bacteria were resistant towards ampicillin, erythromycin, and moxifloxacin, while least resistance was observed against gatifloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, norfloxacin and trimethoprim. These results indicate that plastic litter may act as a conduit for the attachment and transport of multiple antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing severe setbacks to the global efforts on attaining sustainable development goals 3 (health), 6 (clean water) and 14 (life under water). Therefore, strict implementation of plastic waste management rules, awareness campaigns for cleaning beaches and citizen science initiatives to monitor and remove plastics are proposed for protecting the beaches from the deleterious effects of mismanaged plastics.}

abstract = {Background
Owing to the great variety of fracture patterns and limitations of the standard radiographic investigation, all the already available classification systems for radial head and neck fractures (RHNFs) are limited by a poor-to-moderate degree of intraobserver and interobserver reliability. Although computed tomography (CT) is being increasingly used to better understand the fracture characteristics, a CT-based classification system of RHNFs is still lacking. Therefore, in this agreement study, we aimed to propose a classification system based on two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) CT to test the hypothesis that this classification has good intraobserver and interobserver reliability. We have also provided a treatment algorithm.
Methods
Our proposed classification—Proximal and Articular Radial fractures Management (PARMa)—is based on 2D/3D CT imaging. It is divided into four types based on different fractures patterns. The 2D/3D scans of 90 RHNFs were evaluated in a blinded fashion by eight orthopedic and one radiology consultant, according to the proposed classification. The first phase of observation aimed to estimate the interobserver agreement. The second phase involved a new observation, 4 weeks after the first analysis, and estimated the intraobserver reliability. The standard radiographs of these 90 fractures were also evaluated by the same observers, with the same timing and methods, based on the same classification. Cohen's Kappa was applied for intraobserver agreement. Fleiss's Kappa was used both within and among the evaluators. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was employed to determine the strength of association among the appraisers’ rankings. Furthermore, Krippendorff's alpha was chosen as an adjunctive analysis to assess between evaluators’ agreement.
Results
For the intraobserver agreement, Fleiss’ Kappa statistics confirmed the consistency (overall kappa values: 0.70-0.82). Cohen’s Kappa statistics aligned with Fleiss’ Kappa, with similar kappa values and significant P values (P < .001). For interobserver agreement, Fleiss’ Kappa statistics for between appraisers showed moderate-to-substantial agreement, with kappa values ranging from 0.54 to 0.82 for different responses. The results relating to the appraisers' observation of standard radiographs showed that the overall Fleiss’ Kappa values for intraobserver agreement ranged from 0.34 to 0.82, whereas Fleiss’ Kappa statistics for interobserver agreement ranged from 0.40 to 0.69.
Conclusions
The proposed classification system is expected to be reliable, reproducible, and useful for preoperative planning and surgical management. Both 2D and 3D CT allow the identification of the magnitude and position of displacement and articular surface involvement.}

This meta-analysis quantitatively synthesized data from 12 functional neuroimaging studies, including 390 TLE patients and 356 healthy controls (age range: 8.1–70 years; 57.2 % female), to identify language-related brain alterations in TLE. Compared to healthy controls, TLE patients exhibited hypoactivity within the left frontal language regions, including Broca’s area, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting language impairment across syntactic, semantic, and articulatory processes. In parallel, hyperactivity in right-hemisphere regions was observed, reflecting compensatory neuroplastic adaptations to left-hemisphere language dysfunction. This reorganization may partially preserve language function but also indicate language processing inefficiencies. Moderator analyses revealed that in TLE, language comprehension compared with vocabulary elicited occipital hyperactivity and inferior frontal hypoactivity, reflecting posterior compensation and reduced frontal control. Left-sided TLE, compared to right-sided TLE, was more associated with hypoactivity in Broca’s area, reflecting the heightened vulnerability of the language-dominant frontotemporal regions. Greater hyperactivity in the right superior temporal gyrus with longer TLE duration may imply sustained compensatory engagement, whereas diminished hyperactivity in the right hippocampal gyrus with TLE duration may indicate a decline in compensatory capacity due to epileptic disruption. Furthermore, the more severity of language impairment correlated with (1) hypoactivity in Broca’s area, suggesting its role as a neural marker of language dysfunction, and (2) hyperactivity in the left insula, representing neural inefficiency or maladaptive neuroplastic reorganization. Collectively, these findings emphasize the complex interactions between epileptic pathology, compensatory reorganization, and progressive neuroplastic adaptation in shaping language outcomes in TLE.}

abstract = {Background
The burden caused by the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems continues to be an important issue for health care organizations, especially given human resource shortages in health care systems globally. As physicians report spending 2 hours documenting for every hour of patient care, there has been strong interest from many organizations to understand and address the root causes of physician burnout due to EHR burden.
Objective
This study focuses on evaluating physician burnout related to EHR usage and the impact of a physician engagement strategy at a Canadian mental health organization 5 years after implementation.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the perceived impact of the physician engagement strategy on burnout associated with EHR use. Physicians were invited to participate in a web-based survey that included the Mini-Z Burnout questionnaire, along with questions about their perceptions of the EHR and the effectiveness of the initiatives within the physician engagement strategy. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data.
Results
Of the 254 physicians invited, 128 completed the survey, resulting in a 50% response rate. Among the respondents, 26% (33/128) met the criteria for burnout according to the Mini-Z questionnaire, with 61% (20/33) of these attributing their burnout to EHR use. About 52% of participants indicated that the EHR improves communication (67/128) and 38% agreed that the EHR enables high-quality care (49/128). Regarding the physician engagement strategy initiatives, 39% (50/128) agreed that communication through the strategy is efficient, and 75% (96/128) felt more proficient in using the EHR. However, additional areas for improvement within the EHR were identified, including (1) medication reconciliation and prescription processes; (2) chart navigation and information retrieval; (3) longitudinal medication history; and (4) technology infrastructure challenges.
Conclusions
This study highlights the potential impact of EHRs on physician burnout and the effectiveness of a unique physician engagement strategy in fostering positive perceptions and improving EHR usability among physicians. By evaluating this initiative in a real-world setting, the study contributes to the broader literature on strategies aimed at enhancing physician experience following large-scale EHR implementation. However, the findings indicate a continued need for system-level improvements to maximize the value and usage of EHRs. The physician engagement strategy demonstrates the potential to enhance physicians’ EHR experience. Future efforts should prioritize system-level advancements to increase the EHR’s impact on quality of care and develop standardized approaches for engaging physicians on a broader Canadian scale.}

abstract = {Background
Musculoskeletal pain is a prevalent concern among diverse populations, from the average individual to the elite athlete. Handheld percussive massage therapy devices like massage guns have gained much popularity in both medical and athletic settings. Its application has been prominently recognized in injury prevention and rehabilitation. The expansion of the market to provide handheld percussive therapy devices with varying features and price points has encouraged professional and novice use. While percussive therapy holds similarities to more studied therapeutic modalities, like vibration therapy and soft tissue mobilization, there is limited evidence-based information on the indications and contraindications.
Objective
This study aims to use a qualitative analysis of consumer perceptions to understand the perceived therapeutic potential of percussive massage therapy as a home-based intervention for musculoskeletal concerns of everyday users and elite athletes. Additionally, we aim to gain insight on valuable characteristics supporting its therapeutic potential as well as pertinent limitations.
Methods
The TOLOCO massage gun (TOLOCO) was identified as the best-selling percussive massage therapy device on Amazon. We performed an inductive thematic qualitative analysis on the top 100 positive comments and the top 100 critical comments of the device between June 2020 and April 2023 to determine 4 relevant themes.
Results
The 4 themes identified upon qualitative analysis were pain management, versatility, accessibility, and safety and user education. Consumer reviews indicated use for this percussive therapy device in adolescents, adults, and older people across a spectrum of activity levels. Consumers reported the therapeutic potential of percussive massage therapy in managing wide-ranging musculoskeletal concerns like acute pain, chronic pain, nonsurgical injury rehabilitation, postsurgical injury rehabilitation, and injury prevention. Consumers highlighted the versatility of the device to address person-specific needs as a key feature in supporting its perceived therapeutic benefits. Additionally, consumers frequently commented on the affordability and availability of this device to increase accessibility to home-based care. Some critical reviews emphasized a concern for the quality of the device itself. However, this concern did not translate to the overall modality of percussive massage therapy. Of note, despite strong approval for its therapeutic potential, consumer reviews lacked evidence-based insights on appropriate usage.
Conclusions
Home-based percussive massage therapy holds value with its perceived efficacy in pain management for acute and chronic conditions, as well as in injury prevention and rehabilitation. As a low-cost and readily available device for everyday users and high-performing athletes, percussive massage therapy works toward establishing increased health care accessibility and optimizing health care usage. This home-based intervention can serve to reduce the significant personal and economic burden of prevalent musculoskeletal concerns. However, the limited scientific research on percussive massage therapy raises concerns about the lack of evidence-based care and indicates the need for future studies.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate the relationship between short-term changes in quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMGS) after thymectomy and postoperative recurrence in myasthenia gravis (MG) patients without thymoma.
Methods
A retrospective observational cohort study. The QMGS of 44 patients with non-thymomatous MG were evaluated before and 1 month after thymectomy, and the frequency and time of postoperative recurrence were recorded. The reduction rate of QMGS (rr-QMGS) was defined as (QMGS one week before thymectomy − QMGS one month after thymectomy)/ QMGS one week before thymectomy × 100 %, as an indicator of short-term symptom change after thymectomy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to determine an appropriate cut-off value of rr-QMGS for distinguishing postoperative recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to predict postoperative recurrence.
Results
Postoperative recurrence occurred in 21 patients (30 times in total) during follow-up. The mean annual recurrence rate was 3.98 times/year preoperatively and 0.30 times/year postoperatively. ROC analysis determined the cut-off value of rr-QMGS was 36.7 % (sensitivity 90.5 %, specificity 52.2 %). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that rr-QMGS＜36.7 % (hazard rate[HR]6.251, P = 0.014) is positive predictor of postoperative recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that postoperative recurrence time was earlier in the low rr-QMGS group than in the high rr-QMGS group (12.62 vs. 36.60 months, p = 0.005).
Conclusions
Low rr-QMGS is associated with early postoperative recurrence. Rr-QMGS can be used to predict postoperative recurrence of non-thymomatous MG.}

The use of dashi is considered one of the reasons why the low-fat Japanese diet is popular; however, whether and how dashi controls the selection and intake of fat is unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bonito broth, a typical Japanese dashi, affects fat consumption in a mouse model. First, we examined the long-term or short-term intake of corn oil emulsion in adult mice fed bonito broth. No significant effect was observed. Next, mouse dams were fed bonito broth during gestation or lactation and licking of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10% corn oil in their adult pups was evaluated in acute tests. Compared to the control group, there were significant decreases in licks for some corn oil concentrations in the gestation and lactation groups. Finally, corn oil licking was tested in pups fed bonito broth after weaning. No significant effect was detected. This study suggests that dams’ intake of bonito broth during gestation or lactation reduces the intake of fat by their pups in adulthood.}

The BSA fluorescence signal was quenched due to the APU–BSA complex formation and a weak binding affinity was estimated between APR and BSA. The inclusion of fluorescence, UV–vis absorption, molecular docking, and dynamics simulation techniques employed to broadly investigate the combination of APR with BSA at typical physiological conditions. The thermodynamic results revealed that enthalpy (ΔH0) and entropy (ΔS0) changes were computed as +11.14 kJ mol−1 and +97.56 J mol−1 K−1, respectively, which represented the binding is principally entropy-driven and the hydrophobic forces acting a significant role in the reaction. Analysis of synchronous and 3-D fluorescence signals revealed microenvironmental variations close to BSA’s Trp and Tyr residues upon APR addition. Both the competitive site marker as well as molecular docking results detected that APR exhibited a stronger binding affinity towards Drug Site 2 (DS2) compared to Drug Site 1 (DS1).}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Glioblastoma is one of the most common and aggressive primary brain tumours in adults. Though radiation therapy (RT) techniques have progressed significantly in recent decades, patient survival has seen little improvement. However, an area of promise is the use of fluorine-18-fluoroethyltyrosine positron-emission-tomography (18F-FET PET) imaging to assist in RT target delineation. This retrospective study aims to assess the impact of 18F-FET PET scan timing on the resultant RT target volumes and subsequent RT plans in post-operative glioblastoma patients.
Materials and Methods
The imaging and RT treatment data of eight patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and treated at a single institution were analysed. Before starting RT, each patient had two 18F-FET-PET scans acquired within seven days of each other. The information from these 18F-FET-PET scans aided in the creation of two novel target volume sets. The new volumes and plans were compared with each other and the originals.
Results
The median clinical target volume (CTV) 1 was statistically smaller than CTV 2. The median Dice score for the CTV1/CTV2 was 0.98 and, of the voxels that differ (median 6.5 cc), 99.7% were covered with a 5 mm expansion. Overall organs at risk (OAR) and target dosimetry were similar in the PTV1 and PTV2 plans.
Conclusion
Provided the 18F-FET PET scan is acquired within two weeks of the RT planning and a comprehensive approach is taken to CTV delineation, the timing of scan acquisition has minimal impact on the resulting RT plan.}

Students with common forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, often face unique challenges in higher education that are not adequately addressed by current educational resources. One potentially helpful resource is audio content, which provides a flexible and accessible supplement to traditional educational materials. While audio content, such as podcasts, is widely popular, its effect on academic achievement remains underexplored. This pre-registered randomized controlled trial investigated the impact of AI-assisted audio-learning modules on academic achievement, with a particular focus on the mediating roles of motivation and reading engagement. Results showed that the audio-learning modules increased student motivation and reading engagement. Importantly, audio-learning driven increases in motivation and reading engagement boosted academic achievement. Furthermore, students with greater ADHD symptom severity particularly benefited from the audio-learning modules, as they played a crucial role in determining course success. Together, this study highlights the potential of AI-assisted audio-learning modules as a valuable tool in digital education environments, catering to diverse learning needs and improving educational outcomes.}

abstract = {Purpose
Fibronectin adhesion assay progenitors (FAA-CPs) and migratory assay progenitors (MCPs), subsets of mesenchymal-like stromal cells (MSCs), exhibit superior in-vitro chondrogenic potential compared to bone marrow (BM)-MSCs and chondrocytes. To assess this potential, differentiation studies followed by confirmatory staining for collagen deposition are utilized. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), based on birefringence principles, is a valuable tool for visualizing organized collagen fibers. Its use as a predictive tool for assessing chondrogenesis and osteogenesis has not been reported.
Methods
This study involved FAA-CPs, MCPs, chondrocytes, and BM-MSCs derived from osteoarthritic knee joints (n = 3). After phenotypic characterization, the cells underwent chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation, followed by Picrosirius red staining and PLM analysis, including immunohistochemical analysis for collagen types I, II, and X.
Results
Birefringence assessment revealed greater collagen fibril alignment and significant remodeling in the BM-MSC group, which exhibited an arcade-like pattern. The MCP group displayed well-organized collagen fibrils in pericellular zones and as a peripheral band, while chondrocytes and FAA-CPs exhibited lower intensity birefringence, indicating random alignment. Areas with higher collagen type II deposition corresponded to reduced collagen type I and the absence of collagen type X, highlighting the unique fibrillar network seen with PLM was indicative of collagen type II.
Conclusion
While its application for osteogenesis was limited, probably due to the non-fibrillar nature of collagen type X, its value for chondrogenesis is notable. Although not directly reflecting chondrogenesis, PLM can serve as a valuable tool for gaining insights into collagen remodeling, particularly concerning collagen type II during chondrogenic differentiation.}

Moreover, it improved meat quality by increasing L* and reducing drip loss. In addition, dietary glutamine supplementation alleviated the increase in the fast-twitch fibers, abnormal glutamine metabolism, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

In this paper, we propose a new DPM-based generative medical image segmentation method, named EIDiffuSeg. Specifically, we first construct an explicit-implicit aggregation priori knowledge with directional supervision ability by mining the semantic distribution pattern in the frequency and spatial domains. Then, the explicit-implicit aggregation priori knowledge is integrated into the different encoding stages of the denoising backbone network using a novel unsupervised priori knowledge induction strategy, which can guide the model to generate a segmentation mask of the region of interest directionally from a random inference process. We evaluate our method on three medical image segmentation benchmark datasets with different modalities and achieve the best segmentation results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Especially, compared to several current diffusion-based image segmentation methods, we achieved a 9% Dice improvement in the polyp segmentation benchmark.

abstract = {Objectives
Diagnosis and management of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bloodstream infections are often based on positive blood culture results. This retrospective cohort study aimed to develop a classification model using data-driven characterisation to optimise the management of intensive care patients with blood cultures.
Setting, methodology/design
An unsupervised clustering model was developed based on the clinical characteristics of patients with blood cultures in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (n = 2451). It was tested using the data from the MIMIC-III database (n = 2047).
Main outcome measures
The prognosis, blood culture outcomes, antimicrobial interventions, and trajectories of infection indicators were compared between clusters.
Results
Four clusters were identified using machine learning-based k-means clustering based on data obtained 48 h before the first blood culture sampling. Cluster γ was associated with the highest 28-day mortality rate, followed by clusters α, δ, and β. Cluster γ had a higher fungal isolation rate than cluster β (P < 0.05). Cluster δ was associated with a higher isolation rate of Gram-negative organisms and fungi (P < 0.05). Patients in clusters γ and δ underwent more femoral site vein catheter placements than those in cluster β (P < 0.001, all). Patients with a duration of antibiotics treatment of 4, 6, and 7 days in clusters α, δ, and γ, respectively, had the lowest 28-day mortality rate.
Conclusions
Machine learning identified four clusters of intensive care patients with blood cultures, which yielded different prognoses, blood culture outcomes, and optimal duration of antibiotic treatment. Such data-driven blood culture classifications suggest further investigation should be undertaken to optimise treatment and improve care.
Implications for clinical practice
Intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections are heterogeneous. Meaningful classifications associated with outcomes should be described. Using machine learning and cluster analysis could help in understanding heterogeneity. Data-driven blood culture classification could identify distinct physiological states and prognoses before deciding on blood culture sampling, optimise treatment, and improve care.}

Existing safety analysis approaches often focus on the design phase from a process lifecycle perspective. This work therefore also proposes a multi-perspective approach to safety analysis. The approach combines the hierarchy of controls perspective with the automation pyramid, and the digital twin concepts. This approach is applied and discussed in a case study of a retrofitted heat recovery system in an ammonia refrigeration plant.}

abstract = {Lithium-ion battery packs serve as one of the primary functional units in electric vehicles and energy storage systems, making the monitoring of their various parameters critical. However, acquiring data from battery packs is difficult, and experimental data collection requires substantial time and energy. Thus, the challenge of efficiently and accurately obtaining battery pack data is a pressing issue in the development of Battery Management Systems (BMS). This paper presents a simulation method for battery packs based on real cell cloning, demonstrating the effectiveness of using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate cell data reflecting actual charging states. This approach addresses the challenge of temporal data generation for battery packs through image-generating adversarial techniques. Initially, we employ the Pix2Pix GAN to generate battery pack data, followed by fitting the data of cells within the pack using a first-order Gaussian function. The results indicate that our model achieves a sampling point generation error of less than 1 V for the battery pack and less than 5 mV for cells. This advancement can significantly aid researchers in acquiring more effective battery pack data for developing various algorithms and software for BMS functionality testing in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) environments.}

However, the current CPP rational design process is limited, as it requires several rounds of peptide synthesis, prediction and wet-lab validation, which is expensive, time-consuming and requires extensive knowledge in peptide chemistry. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising alternative which can augment the design process, for example by determining physiochemical characteristics, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, disorder and flexibility, as well as predicting in vivo behaviour such as toxicity and peptidase degradation. Other more recent tools utilise supervised machine learning (ML) to predict the penetrative ability of an amino acid sequence. The use of AI in the CPP design process has the potential to reduce development costs and increase the chances of success with respect to delivery. This review provides a survey of in silico tools and AI platforms which can be utilised in the design process, and the key features that should be taken into consideration when designing next generation CPPs.}

However, there remain challenges in generated data, such as low visual quality, weak generalization and mismatches between generated images and annotations, which hinder the performance of object detectors. To alleviate these issues, we propose the RegionDiffusion, a novel layout-to-image model that uses an attention block called Region Self-Attention to divide the self-attention operation among visual tokens into several independent regions based on the bounding box of the layout to generate objects accurately in the given locations. Then, we design a pipeline utilizing a series of preprocessing and postprocessing steps to improve the quality of the generated data and then train detectors. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RegionDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art models in layout-to-image generation and our pipeline significantly improves the performance of object detectors in both general domains and specific domains.}

abstract = {Introduction
While there is no consensus on the best surgical procedure for post-burn axillary contractures, it is crucial to consider the elongation rate along the scar axis as a useful measurement index for determining the optimal surgical approach. The square flap and five flap z-plasty techniques are commonly employed scar lengthening procedures to address scar contractures in the axilla. These approaches successfully disrupt the linear scar, leading to significant elongation while reducing transverse tension. Our study aims to compare the increase in band length and functional results of these two approaches for treating post-burn contractures in the axilla.
Methods
A retrospective study was carried out utilizing data from 34 patients with mild-to-moderate band-like contractures located on the anterior or posterior axillary lines who underwent surgical correction through either the square flap method or five-flap z-plasty technique. The effectiveness of surgical methods was evaluated using two objective indices: improvement in contracture band length and improvement in abduction angle at the shoulder joint.
Results
All patients achieved complete contracture release. There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the improvement in the degree of abduction postoperatively. Although there was a significant increase in the length of the contracture band postoperatively in both groups, the average increase in length for cases treated with a square flap was significantly greater than those managed with a five-flap Z-plasty (87.7 ± 44.8 % vs. 38.80 ± 11.119 %,) respectively.
Conclusion
The square flap technique is considered a better alternative to the commonly used 5-flap Z-plasty method because it can achieve higher elongation in the contracture band, restore joint function, and create optimal shape when dealing with single linear band contractures over the axilla.}

The focused kV x-ray approach was proposed to achieve a restricted target size that is difficult for existing devices. The treatment planning of focused X-ray irradiation requires the dose kernel libraries to produce dose maps. However, the Monte Carlo approach for dose kernel library generation is time- and space-consuming. To optimize spatiotemporal efficiency, we propose a machine learning approach based on 3D implicit neural functions to model focused kV X-ray dose kernels for small animal brain radiation. Based on the rat head phantom model, we define a library spanning a parameter space with proper range and resolution to cover the rat brain size and structure variation. We use the TOPAS-based Monte Carlo simulation for data preparation. Each dose kernel can be characterized by a depth parameter triplet. Implicit neural functions are trained to map spatial coordinates with a depth parameter triplet to their corresponding dose values. We find the periodic activation function of hidden neural layers and coordinate embedding of coordinates are important for accurate modeling. Experimental results show that we compress the training library from 17 GB to only 2.27 MB with high accuracy, and it is also shown to predict dose kernels in the testing dose kernels with an acceleration rate of 50,000 times, which is crucial to study the choice of optimal lens. This work is the first attempt to develop machine-learning techniques for modeling dose kernel libraries for small animal brain radiation.}

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are a unique form of machine learning that facilitates inputs of unstructured text/numerical information for meaningful interpretation and prediction. Recently, LLMs have become commercialized, allowing the average person to access these incredibly powerful tools. Early adopters focused on LLM use in performing logical tasks, including—but not limited to—generating titles, identifying key words, summarizing text, initial editing of scientific work, improving statistical protocols, and performing statistical analysis. More recently, LLMs have been expanded to clinical practice and academia to perform higher cognitive and creative tasks. LLMs provide personalized assistance in learning, facilitate the management of electronic medical records, and offer valuable insights into clinical decision making in cardiology. They enhance patient education by explaining intricate medical conditions in lay terms, have a vast library of knowledge to help clinicians expedite administrative tasks, provide useful feedback regarding content of scientific writing, and assist in the peer-review process. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not without limitations. They are susceptible to generating incorrect or plagiarized content, face challenges in handling tasks without detailed prompts, and lack originality. These limitations underscore the importance of human oversight in using LLMs in medical science and clinical practice. As LLMs continue to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial in maximizing their potential benefits while mitigating risks. This review explores the functions, opportunities, and constraints of LLMs, with a focus on their impact on cardiology, illustrating both the transformative power and the boundaries of current technology in medicine.
Résumé
Les grands modèles de langage (LLM; large language models) représentent une forme unique d'apprentissage automatique qui facilite la saisie de textes non structurés et/ou d'informations numériques en vue d'une interprétation et d'une prédiction significatives. Récemment, les LLM ont été commercialisés, permettant au commun des mortels d'accéder à ces outils incroyablement puissants. Les premiers utilisateurs se sont concentrés sur l'utilisation des LLM pour effectuer des tâches logiques, y compris, mais sans s'y limiter, la génération de titres, l'identification de mots-clés, le résumé de textes, l'édition initiale de travaux scientifiques, l'amélioration de protocoles statistiques et l'exécution d'analyses statistiques. Plus récemment, les LLM ont été étendus à la pratique clinique et au monde universitaire pour effectuer des tâches cognitives et créatives de haut niveau. Les LLM fournissent une aide personnalisée à l'apprentissage, facilitent la gestion des dossiers médicaux électroniques et offrent des informations précieuses pour la prise de décision clinique en cardiologie. Ils améliorent l'éducation des patients en expliquant des conditions médicales complexes avec des termes simples, disposent d'une vaste bibliothèque de connaissances pour aider les cliniciens à accélérer les tâches administratives, fournissent un retour d'information utile sur le contenu des écrits scientifiques et participent au processus de révision par les pairs. Malgré leurs capacités impressionnantes, les LLM ne sont pas sans limitations. Ils sont susceptibles de générer des contenus incorrects ou plagiés, sont confrontés à des difficultés pour effectuer des tâches sans instructions détaillées et manquent d'originalité. Ces limitations soulignent l'importance de la surveillance humaine dans l'utilisation des LLM en science médicale et dans la pratique clinique. À mesure que les LLM continuent d'évoluer, il sera essentiel de relever ces défis pour maximiser leurs avantages potentiels tout en atténuant les risques. Cette étude explore les fonctions, les opportunités et les contraintes des LLM, en mettant l'accent sur leur impact en cardiologie, illustrant à la fois le pouvoir de transformation et les limites de la technologie actuelle en médecine.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-derived cancer models (PDCMs) have become essential tools in cancer research and preclinical studies. Consequently, the number of publications on PDCMs has increased significantly over the past decade. Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for extracting knowledge from scientific literature at scale.
Objective
This study aims to investigate LLM-based systems, focusing specifically on prompting techniques for the automated extraction of PDCM-related entities from scientific texts.
Methods
We explore 2 LLM-prompting approaches. The classic method, direct prompting, involves manually designing a prompt. Our direct prompt consists of an instruction, entity-type definitions, gold examples, and a query. In addition, we experiment with a novel and underexplored prompting strategy—soft prompting. Unlike direct prompting, soft prompts are trainable continuous vectors that learn from provided data. We evaluate both prompting approaches across state-of-the-art proprietary and open LLMs.
Results
We manually annotated 100 abstracts of PDCM-relevant papers, focusing on PDCM papers with data deposited in the CancerModels.Org platform. The resulting gold annotations span 15 entity types for a total 3313 entity mentions, which we split across training (2089 entities), development (542 entities) and held-out, eye-off test (682 entities) sets. Evaluation includes the standard metrics of precision or positive predictive value, recall or sensitivity, and F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) in 2 settings: an exact match setting, where spans of gold and predicted annotations have to match exactly, and an overlapping match setting, where the spans of gold and predicted annotations have to overlap. GPT4-o with direct prompting achieved F1-scores of 50.48 and 71.36 for exact and overlapping match settings, respectively. In both evaluation settings, LLaMA3 soft prompting improved performance over direct prompting (F1-score from 7.06 to 46.68 in the exact match setting; and 12.0 to 71.80 in the overlapping evaluation setting). Results with LLaMA3 soft prompting are slightly higher than GPT4-o direct prompting in the overlapping match evaluation setting.
Conclusions
We investigated LLM-prompting techniques for the automatic extraction of PDCM-relevant entities from scientific texts, comparing the traditional direct prompting approach with the emerging soft prompting method. In our experiments, GPT4-o demonstrated strong performance with direct prompting, maintaining competitive results. Meanwhile, soft prompting significantly enhanced the performance of smaller open LLMs. Our findings suggest that training soft prompts on smaller open models can achieve performance levels comparable to those of proprietary very large language models.}

The test demonstrated limit of detection of 25 CFU/mL for MTB, 200 CFU/mL for rpoB and inhA/katG targets with >95 % CI. The specificity for MTC was supported by a comprehensive clinical validation (n = 100).

My ultimate goal is to relativize the novelty of AI, seeking to alleviate the moral anxieties it currently elicits and encouraging a more normal, optimistic view of it.

Although it is known, that silver interacts and binds on complex organic substances like proteins, many experiments on the sterilisation efficiency and inhibiting properties are still carried out in complex culture media. Given, that silver is often applied in environments with no or few organic substrates, like cooling circuits or in the treatment of tap and process water, further insight on the minimum inhibition concentration and lethal concentration at those conditions is of interest. We have developed a defined medium for the standard bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is free of complex organic carbon with equal cultivation properties like commonly used nutrient solutions. With this medium we could narrow the range of the MIC between 2.5 μg to 10 μg∙L−1, which very much overlaps with the bactericidic concentration depending on the initial concentration of bacteria cells. These results might help to optimise the technical application of silver. We further observed a delayed growth of bacterial cultures of up to three days compared to silver free controls, which is caused either by a partial sterilisation down to theoretical one surviving cell or by a prolonged lag phase. Based on these observations we recommend a prolonged incubation for experiments on sterilisation with silver and the use of defined media, which do not interact with the disinfecting agent.}

Generally, CS are the main waste by-products of cocoa production, and their utilization is limited. The coating materials were mainly compounded using melamine (a blowing agent), ammonium polyphosphate (a dehydrating agent), and the same doses of PER, CS or their mixtures (PER/CS). They were primarily investigated using a gas flame-heated furnace (according to a cellulosic fire curve), TGA, and DSC techniques. The CS addition markedly affected charring processes of ICs during the fire test and improved intumescence effectiveness and thermal insulation time parameters (from 15.9 to 23.6 a.u. and from 28.2 to 30.9 min, respectively). Moreover, the natural additive increased compression strength of charred ICs on a steel substrate (from 1.48 to 1.88 kPa). The best performance properties were noted for IC with the PER/CS mixture containing 10 wt% of the organic component – in this case all the tested features were improved.}

Cross-correlation functions of ambient noise were calculated between station pairs to determine dispersion curves at a period bandwidth of 3 to 9 s, from which a shear-wave velocity model was constructed to a depth of 20 km. In the top 5 km, low shear-wave velocity < 3400 m/s correlates with low electrical resistivity <100 Ohm.m from a broadband MT inversion of 134 co-located sites, primarily due to fluid-porosity of sediments. In the depth range 5–20 km there are two notable features. Firstly, across the southern part of the Curnamona Province shear-wave velocity increases by >200 m/s from west to east, over ∼200 km, correlated with a trend in Bouguer gravity that increases from −200 μm/s2 to +200 μm/s2. Secondly, there is weaker correlation in dip and spatial extent between a zone of low resistivity <10 Ohm.m and low shear-wave velocity < 3600 m/s. Higher density crust in the eastern margin of the Curnamona Province may be due to Paleoproterozoic-aged mafic crust that was originally subducted and then upthrust to shallower depths during the Olarian Orogeny from 1620 to 1580 Ma. Reduced shear-wave velocity coincident with low-resistivity in the crust may be related to grain-boundary graphitic Paleoproterozoic sediments that would be ductile with slightly lower shear-modulus and be electrically conductive.}

abstract = {Background
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) accounts for 70–80% of all ovarian cancer-related deaths. Multiple studies have suggested that the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) serves as the cell of origin of HGSOC. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and its loss is sufficient to induce numerous tumorigenic changes in FTE, including increased migration, formation of multicellular tumor spheroids (MTSs), and ovarian colonization. In murine oviductal epithelial (MOE) cells (the equivalent of human FTE) loss of PTEN results in the upregulation of transcripts associated with the extracellular matrix, with a specific focus on the elevation of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2). Although LOXL2 is known to drive transformation and invasion in solid tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis in ovarian cancer, its specific role in the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer originating from FTE remains unclear. Therefore, we aim to investigate whether LOXL2 mediates tumorigenesis from the fallopian tube epithelium.
Methods
In this study, we utilized clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CAS9) technology to delete LOXL2 in PTEN-deficient MOE cells to understand its role in mediating the oncogenic effects of PTEN loss. In addition, CRISPR-CAS9 was used to delete LOXL2 in OVCAR8 ovarian cancer cells. We monitored the changes in tumorigenic properties, such as migration, invasion, and growth of three-dimensional (3D) spheroids, to assess whether the loss of LOXL2 resulted in any changes.
Results
We found that a reduction in LOXL2 expression did not significantly change the migration or invasive capabilities of PTEN-depleted MOE or human ovarian cancer cells. However, we found that a reduction in LOXL2 expression resulted in a significant reduction in 3D MTS formation and survival in both lines.
Conclusions
These results reveal for the first time that PTEN loss in FTE cells increases LOXL2 expression through downregulation of Pax2, and LOXL2 deletion blocks 3D spheroid formation.}

abstract = {Background
Nursing education increasingly emphasizes academic writing and communication, critical for delivering quality patient care and professional advancement. Rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming educational methodologies, and a focus is being placed on embedding AI literacy to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. These technologies have the potential to reshape nursing education in a technology-driven health-care landscape.
Aim
This study investigated the effectiveness of AI literacy and the application of ChatGPT and Copilot in academic nursing report writing. It assessed the level of AI literacy of nursing students, examined the integration of basic AI concepts into a curriculum, and analyzed the impact of these tools compared with traditional teaching methods.
Methods
The study adopted a sample of 203 senior nursing students from Southern Taiwan to compare an AI-enhanced teaching approach using ChatGPT and Copilot with conventional methods. The curriculum, centered on the “Writing Case Reports and Seminars” course, employed the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate model and incorporated scaffolding techniques to synergistically integrate clinical skills with academic learning. AI literacy was measured using the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS). Summative assessments, adhering to the Taiwan Nursing Association standards, focused on individual and group case report evaluations.
Findings
Following an 18-week AI intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all dimensions of the MAILS. A ChatGPT usage of 100 % was found, with a notable enhancement discovered in the “Nursing Plan” section of case reports. Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group.
Conclusions
The incorporation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students' AI literacy and performance in summative assessments. Effective AI training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. Addressing the current limitations of AI has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education.}

abstract = {Background
Symptom-checkers have become important tools for self-triage, assisting patients to determine the urgency of medical care. To be safe and effective, these tools must be validated, particularly to avoid potentially hazardous undertriage without leading to inefficient overtriage. Only limited safety data from studies including small sample sizes have been available so far.
Objective
The objective of our study was to prospectively investigate the safety of patients’ self-triage in a large patient sample. We used SMASS (Swiss Medical Assessment System; in4medicine, Inc) pathfinder, a symptom-checker based on a computerized transparent neural network.
Methods
We recruited 2543 patients into this single-center, prospective clinical trial conducted at the cantonal hospital of Baden, Switzerland. Patients with an Emergency Severity Index of 1-2 were treated by the team of the emergency department, while those with an index of 3-5 were seen at the walk-in clinic by general physicians. We compared the triage recommendation obtained by the patients’ self-triage with the assessment of clinical urgency made by 3 successive interdisciplinary panels of physicians (panels A, B, and C). Using the Clopper-Pearson CI, we assumed that to confirm the symptom-checkers’ safety, the upper confidence bound for the probability of a potentially hazardous undertriage should lie below 1%. A potentially hazardous undertriage was defined as a triage in which either all (consensus criterion) or the majority (majority criterion) of the experts of the last panel (panel C) rated the triage of the symptom-checker to be “rather likely” or “likely” life-threatening or harmful.
Results
Of the 2543 patients, 1227 (48.25%) were female and 1316 (51.75%) male. None of the patients reached the prespecified consensus criterion for a potentially hazardous undertriage. This resulted in an upper 95% confidence bound of 0.1184%. Further, 4 cases met the majority criterion. This resulted in an upper 95% confidence bound for the probability of a potentially hazardous undertriage of 0.3616%. The 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CI for the probability of overtriage (n=450 cases,17.69%) was 16.23% to 19.24%, which is considerably lower than the figures reported in the literature.
Conclusions
The symptom-checker proved to be a safe triage tool, avoiding potentially hazardous undertriage in a real-life clinical setting of emergency consultations at a walk-in clinic or emergency department without causing undesirable overtriage. Our data suggest the symptom-checker may be safely used in clinical routine.

abstract = {Numerous age-related degenerative diseases have been linked to diminished intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH), a vital antioxidant in the human body. Unfortunately, exogenous GSH encounters various barriers that prevent its entry into most human cells. γ-Glutamylcysteine (γ-EC), an immediate precursor of GSH, is a potential therapeutic agent that restores cellular GSH levels. Additionally, both compounds can serve as kokumi taste substances and enhance basic taste sensations. Considering the growing interest among health-conscious consumers toward naturally derived diets, the incorporation of fresh fruits and vegetables abundant in GSH and γ-EC presents a promising alternative for supplementation. Screening of various plant samples, including fruits, vegetables, and mushrooms, revealed that ripe durian pulp exhibited the highest levels of GSH (∼2.6) and γ-EC (∼14) per milligram per gram of dry weight. Owing to the popularity of durian-related products, we extended our investigation to analyze GSH and γ-EC contents in processed products. Notably, durian chips and pastes displayed a significant decrease in GSH and γ-EC levels, suggesting their sensitivity to heat. This observation was further validated by the observed instability of GSH and γ-EC standards during heat treatment. Our findings underscore the potential of durian fruit as a rich dietary source of GSH and γ-EC.}

Here, a data augmentation method based on the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (GP) and Content Constraint Penalty (CP) terms, a generative deep-learning model via the adversarial training of a generator and a discriminator, was established, in which the GP and CP terms ensure training stability and the physical rationality of the generated samples. The results indicate that the generated samples improve the performance of the oxynitride glass composition-property models trained with the XGBoost algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization capability. Furthermore, the augmented models outperform the general glass prediction model, GlassNet, over 101 experimental samples not included in the training datasets. Based on SHAP's single feature analysis and feature interaction analysis, the interpretability study further sheds light on the contributions of elements and the interactive effects of element pairs on the properties of oxynitride glasses. These achievements not only provide reliable models for the composition-property studies of oxynitride glasses but also offer a novel strategy for developing high-performance data-driven models under data scarcity scenarios.}

The present study explores the relation between question asking complexity and problem-solving tasks involving open- and close-ended thinking and how these abilities generalize and compare to AI. In Study 1, participants (N = 89) completed the alternative questions task (AQT), a close-ended riddles task (Stumpers), and the alternate uses task (AUT), a creativity measure. Our results show AQT question complexity wasn't correlated with stumpers performance, although it correlated with AUT originality (r = .3). In Study 2, participants (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, and open-ended creative problem-solving (CPS) task. CPS responses were evaluated for originality and quality. A positive correlation was observed between CPS quality and AQT complexity (r = .29) and originality (r = .34). In study 3, AI agents (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, stumpers, and CPS tasks. Like humans, AI's AQT originality and complexity were related with open, but not closed problem-solving. AI questions were also significantly more creative and complex, it solved more stumpers and gave higher quality CPS solutions. Surprisingly, human and AI CPS originality didn't differ. We find significant links between question complexity and open—but not closed-ended—problem-solving in humans, which generalize to AI. Our results highlight the significance of complex and creative question-asking in everyday life and as an integral part of our problem-solving toolkit.}

In the GNDRE model, not only are the observation equations and/or system equations functionally nonlinear, but also random effects may appear in any part of the problem. This situation can be seen when one has to fuse the data from different sensors, including a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Inertial Navigation System (INS) and vision sensors. In other words, here we consider not only the random noise in the observation vector, but also the random errors that may appear in all parts of the functional model. These scattered noises can be, for example, due to ground vision data. The GEKF algorithm is developed based on condition equations. It helps us to obtain the predicted residuals directly. Also, a rigorous posterior dispersion (variance–covariance) matrix of the unknown parameters is obtained. Therefore, considering all possible random noises and a rigorous approach including a proper linearization of functional model and prediction of posterior dispersion are the two main characteristics of the proposed algorithm. The results of the integration navigation for a GNSS/Vision/INS system approve the efficiency of the proposed approach. In particular, the new GEKF is implemented in the integrated navigation of two low-cost tightly coupled GNSS/Vision/INS systems in which random effects can play an important role, particularly, in some cases there is lack of reliable data.}

But the psychological mechanisms underlying this tendency remain unclear. Prior research has relied entirely on self-reports that are vulnerable to bias. This leaves open the question as to whether negative reactions are a reflection of motivated reasoning – a controlled, cognitive process in which people justify their scepticism about AI's creative capacity – or whether they stem from deeper, embodied feelings of threat to human creative uniqueness manifested physiologically. We address this question across two lab-in-field studies, measuring participants' self-reported and physiological responses to the same piece of music framed either as having AI or human origins. Study 1 (N = 50) revealed that individuals in the AI condition appreciated music less, reported less intense emotions, and experienced decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity as compared to those in the human condition. Study 2 (N = 372) showed that these effects were more pronounced among individuals who more strongly endorsed the belief that creativity is uniquely human, and that this could largely be explained by the perceived threat posed by AI. Together, these findings suggest that unfavourable responses to AI-generated music are not driven solely by controlled cognitive justifications but also by automatic, embodied threat reactions in response to creative AI. They suggest that strategies addressing perceived threats posed by AI may be key to fostering more harmonious human-AI collaboration and acceptance.}

The use of mobile technologies to deliver behavioral health interventions, including smoking cessation support, has grown. Users’ perceptions are important determinants of the adoption and use of new technologies. However, little is known about users’ perceptions of mobile technologies as smoking cessation aids, particularly among disadvantaged individuals who smoke.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the acceptance of mobile technologies for smoking cessation among young adults with low socioeconomic status who smoke.
Methods
In total, 38 current cigarette smokers, 18 to 29 years old, who wanted to quit and did not have a 4-year college degree nor were enrolled in a 4-year college, participated in 12 semistructured digital focus groups. The moderation guide was guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology constructs (ie, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy, and social influence), sentiment (ie, negative, neutral, and positive), and purpose of using mobile technologies (ie, lifestyle and health management and smoking cessation) following a deductive thematic analysis approach.
Results
Participants had positive experiences using mobile technologies for lifestyle and health management, primarily for fitness and dietary purposes. Salient themes were facilitating conditions of use (44/80, 55%), with prior experiences and costs subthemes, followed by perceived usefulness of mobile technologies in helping users attain health goals (22/80, 27.50%), which were generally positive. Ease of use (11/80, 13.75%) and social influences (3/80, 3.75%) were minimally discussed. Conversely, participants had limited awareness of smoking cessation uses of mobile technologies, which was the primary barrier under facilitating conditions discussed (33/51, 64.70%). Participants expressed skepticism about the usefulness of mobile technologies in helping them quit smoking (14/51, 27.45%). Effort expectancy was not discussed, given participants’ limited prior use. Social influences on mobile technology use for smoking cessation were minimally discussed (4/51, 7.84%).
Conclusions
The use of mobile technologies for smoking cessation was unknown to young adults with low socioeconomic status who smoke. To reduce cigarette smoking and associated health disparities, increasing awareness and use of evidence-based mobile-based smoking cessation interventions are needed. Smoking cessation interventions should incorporate features perceived as useful and easy to use to capitalize on positive user experiences and the acceptability of mobile technologies for lifestyle and health management.}

abstract = {Introduction
Recent reviews suggest that PRP injections can improve pain and function more effectively than other treatments; however, consensus on the optimal number of injections is lacking. We aimed to determine the optimal administration frequency and number of PRP injections for management of osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms, to examine long-term effects and structural improvements with PRP, and to determine correlations between clinical outcomes and imaging findings.
Methods
This longitudinal study included 167 patients with knee OA, categorized using the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grading system. Participants received up to six PRP injections and were followed-up for 24 months. Pain levels were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS); functional recovery was measured using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). To determine whether PRP can induce sustained structural improvements, we used the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) to monitor changes in bone-marrow lesions (BMLs). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance to identify significant changes in pain and functional outcomes.
Results
VAS and KOOS scores significantly improved after PRP treatment. Patients with KL grades 1 and 2 exhibited maximum pain relief after the fourth injection; those with KL grades 3 and 4 showed optimal results after the fifth injection. Improvements were maintained or enhanced at the 24-month follow-up. The effect size increased as the number of treatments progressed, and especially after the fourth treatment, with a Cohen's d values of −1.22, −1.28, and −0.99 (p < 0.0001).
Conclusions
PRP injections administered at specific intervals can significantly reduce pain and improve function in patients with OA, with the required frequency depending on disease severity.

abstract = {Background
The success of eHealth relies on interorganizational collaboration (IOC) throughout the development, evaluation, and implementation phases of eHealth deployment. This IOC is complex, as it involves a diversity of organizations from different sectors, such as technological, academic, health care, and governmental organizations, collaborating to deploy eHealth. Between these organizations, organizational boundaries, defined as the demarcation of an organization from its environment, arise. When these boundaries are perceived as aligned and enable complementarity, IOC is facilitated. By contrast, misalignment of organizational boundaries can hinder IOC. A dialogical learning mechanism, defined as a learning process that occurs when boundaries hinder IOC, can support learning how to navigate such boundaries. However, it is difficult to determine whether and when organizational boundaries facilitate or hinder IOC, and which dialogical learning mechanisms can be used to address these challenges during eHealth deployment. Previous literature presents the barriers and facilitators of IOC during eHealth deployment only for subsets of organizations or specific phases, leaving their generic versus phase specific applicability uncharted.
Objective
This scoping review aims to identify whether, and under what circumstances, organizational boundaries facilitate or hinder IOC during the development, evaluation, and implementation of eHealth.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using searches in the PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they were empirical studies written in English or Dutch and contained findings on factors influencing IOC during the development, evaluation, or implementation phases of eHealth deployment. The search yielded 11,867 articles, of which 16 met the inclusion criteria. Open and axial coding of the extracted findings was performed to identify organizational boundaries and dialogical learning mechanisms that hindered or facilitated IOC during eHealth deployment.
Results
In each phase, different organizational boundaries either hindered or facilitated IOC. The dialogical learning mechanism identification was crucial for enhancing IOC and was supported by training or by establishing IOC from previous relationships. Additionally, the learning mechanism coordination improved IOC and depended on the involvement of boundary spanners (ie, individuals who span organizational boundaries) and the use of boundary objects (ie, objects which help bridge different social worlds). Furthermore, the mechanism reflection, fostered through open and frequent communication, facilitated IOC. The dialogical learning mechanism transformation did not influence IOC during any phase of eHealth deployment.
Conclusions
IOC in eHealth deployment is a dynamic process that depends on the dialogical learning mechanisms identification, coordination, and reflection to navigate organizational boundaries. This review is the first to present organizational boundaries and dialogical learning mechanisms that influence IOC across the different phases of eHealth deployment. However, further research that explicitly considers these phases is needed to deepen the understanding of IOC in eHealth deployment.}

Designing new therapeutics requires careful consideration of immune responses, particularly the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) reaction to intra-cellular proteins. In this study, we introduce CAPE-Beam, a novel decoding strategy for the established ProteinMPNN protein design model. Our approach minimizes CTL immunogenicity risk by limiting designs to only consist of kmers that are either predicted not to be presented to CTLs or are subject to central tolerance that prevents CTLs from attacking self-peptides. We compare CAPE-Beam to the standard way of sampling from ProteinMPNN and the state of the art (SOTA) technique CAPE-MPNN. We find that our novel decoding strategy can produce structurally similar proteins while incorporating more human like kmers. This significantly lowers CTL immunogenicity risk in precision medicine, and represents a key step towards reducing this risk in protein therapeutics targeting a wider patient population.

On the other hand, the power of popular protein language models (pLM) has seldom been harnessed for predicting NABPs. In this study, we propose a novel framework called GraphNABP, to predict NABP by integrating sequence and predicted 3D structure information. Specifically, sequence embeddings and protein molecular graphs were first obtained from ProtT5 protein language model and predicted 3D structures, respectively. Then, graph attention (GAT) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks were used to enhance feature representations. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to predict NABPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to integrate AlphaFold and protein language models for the prediction of NABPs. The performances on multiple independent test sets indicate that GraphNABP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of pLM embeddings and structural information for NABP prediction.

Medication review and reconciliation is essential for optimizing drug therapy and minimizing medication errors. Large language models (LLMs) have been recently shown to possess a lot of potential applications in healthcare field due to their abilities of deductive, abductive, and logical reasoning. The present study assessed the abilities of LLMs in medication review and medication reconciliation processes.
Methods
Four LLMs were prompted with appropriate queries related to dosing regimen errors, drug-drug interactions, therapeutic drug monitoring, and genomics-based decision-making process. The veracity of the LLM outputs were verified from validated sources using pre-validated criteria (accuracy, relevancy, risk management, hallucination mitigation, and citations and guidelines). The impacts of the erroneous responses on the patients' safety were categorized either as major or minor.
Results
In the assessment of four LLMs regarding dosing regimen errors, drug-drug interactions, and suggestions for dosing regimen adjustments based on therapeutic drug monitoring and genomics-based individualization of drug therapy, responses were generally consistent across prompts with no clear pattern in response quality among the LLMs. For identification of dosage regimen errors, ChatGPT performed well overall, except for the query related to simvastatin. In terms of potential drug-drug interactions, all LLMs recognized interactions with warfarin but missed the interaction between metoprolol and verapamil. Regarding dosage modifications based on therapeutic drug monitoring, Claude-Instant provided appropriate suggestions for two scenarios and nearly appropriate suggestions for the other two. Similarly, for genomics-based decision-making, Claude-Instant offered satisfactory responses for four scenarios, followed by Gemini for three. Notably, Gemini stood out by providing references to guidelines or citations even without prompting, demonstrating a commitment to accuracy and reliability in its responses. Minor impacts were noted in identifying appropriate dosing regimens and therapeutic drug monitoring, while major impacts were found in identifying drug interactions and making pharmacogenomic-based therapeutic decisions.
Conclusion
Advanced LLMs hold significant promise in revolutionizing the medication review and reconciliation process in healthcare. Diverse impacts on patient safety were observed. Integrating and validating LLMs within electronic health records and prescription systems is essential to harness their full potential and enhance patient safety and care quality.}

abstract = {Background
In oncohematology, both the development of the disease and the side effects of antineoplastic treatment often take a toll on patients’ physical and nutritional well-being. In this era of digital transformation, we launched a pioneering project for oncohematologic patients to promote adherence to a healthy lifestyle and improve their physical and nutritional well-being. We aim to achieve this goal by involving doctors and nutritionists through the Nootric app.
Objective
This study aims to assess the impact of the use of eHealth tools to facilitate nutrition and well-being in oncohematologic patients. We also aim to determine the usefulness of physical-nutritional management in improving tolerance to chemotherapy treatments within routine clinical practice.
Methods
We designed a descriptive, observational, longitudinal, prospective cohort pilot study that included a total of 22 patients from March to May 2022 in the Vinalopó University Hospital. The inclusion criteria were adults over 18 years of age diagnosed with oncohematological pathology in active chemotherapy treatment. An action plan was created to generate alerts between the doctor and the nutritionist. In the beginning, the patients were trained to use the app and received education highlighting the importance of nutrition and physical exercise. Sociodemographic, clinical-biological-analytical (eg, malnutrition index), health care impact, usability, and patient adherence data were collected. Tolerance to chemotherapy treatment and its health care impact were evaluated.
Results
We included 22 patients, 11 (50%) female and 11 (50%) male, ranging between 42 and 84 years of age. Among them, 13 (59%) were adherents to the program. The most frequent diseases were lymphoproliferative syndromes (13/22, 59%) and multiple myeloma (4/22, 18%). Moreover, 15 (68%) out of 22 patients received immunochemotherapy, while 7 (32%) out of 22 patients received biological treatment. No worsening of clinical-biological parameters was observed. Excluding dropouts and abandonments (n=9/22, 41%), the adherence rate was 81%, established by calculating the arithmetic mean of the adherence rates of 13 patients. No admission was observed due to gastrointestinal toxicity or discontinuation of treatment related to alterations in physical and nutritional well-being. In addition, only 5.5% of unscheduled consultations were increased due to incidents in well-being, mostly telematic (n=6/103 consultation are unscheduled). Additionally, 92% of patients reported an improvement in their nutritional habits (n=12/13), and up to 45% required adjustment of medical supportive treatment (n=5/11). There were no cases of grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity. All of this reflects improved tolerance to treatments. Patients reported a satisfaction score of 4.3 out of 5, while professionals rated their satisfaction at 4.8 out of 5.
Conclusions
We demonstrated the usefulness of integrating new technologies through a multidisciplinary approach. The Nootric app facilitated collaboration among the medical team, nutritionists, and patients. It enabled us to detect health issues related to physical-nutritional well-being, anticipate major complications, and mitigate potentially avoidable risks. Consequently, there was a decrease in unscheduled visits and admissions related to this condition.}

abstract = {Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to the accumulation of glycogen in various tissues, especially in skeletal muscles. The disease manifests as a large spectrum of phenotypes from infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) to late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), depending on the age of symptoms onset. Quantifying GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle provides important information about the disease severity. However, the distribution of GAA and glycogen levels in skeletal muscles from healthy individuals and those impacted by Pompe disease remains poorly understood, and there is currently no universally accepted standard assay for GAA activity measurement. This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the available information on GAA activity and glycogen content levels in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with Pompe disease. A structured review of PubMed and Google Scholar literature (with the latter used to check that no additional publications were identified) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications on glycogen storage disease type II [MeSH term] + GAA, protein human (supplementary concept), Pompe, muscle; and muscle, acid alpha-glucosidase. A limit of English language was applied. Results were grouped by methodologies used to quantify GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle. The search and selection strategy were devised and carried out in line with Preferred Reporting of Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and documented using a flowchart. Bibliographies of papers included in the analysis were reviewed and applicable publications not already identified in the search were included. Of the 158 articles retrieved, 24 (comprising >100 muscle biopsies from >100 patients) were included in the analysis, with four different assays. Analysis revealed that patients with IOPD exhibited markedly lower GAA activity in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD, regardless of the measurement method employed. Additionally, patients with IOPD had notably higher glycogen content levels in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD. In general, however, it was difficult to fully characterize GAA activity because of the different methods used. The findings underscore the challenges in the interpretation and comparison of the results across studies because of the substantial methodological variations. There is a need to establish standardized reference ranges of GAA activity and glycogen content in healthy individuals and in Pompe disease patients based on globally standardized methods to improve comparability and reliability in assessing this rare disease.}

abstract = {Purpose
Digital clothes (DCs) are an emerging product category whose commercial success will heavily depend on consumers’ perception of their economic and symbolic value. However, existing studies have overlooked the empirical assessment of consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for such products. As a result, the factors underlying consumers’ motivation to pay for them are still a matter of debate.
Design/methodology/approach
We ran three quantitative studies, including one involving participants in a real consumption context that assessed: (1) whether the perceived uniqueness of DCs increases consumers’ WTP for these products and (2) whether this effect depends on consumers’ sensation-seeking tendency (SST) and the instrumental need for touch (NFT).
Findings
We found that the higher the perceived uniqueness of DCs, the higher the consumers’ WTP for them. This effect was stronger for consumers who exhibited high SST and NFT.
Practical implications
DC developers and retailers should consider uniqueness as a key driver of DC consumption. They should target sensation seekers with high instrumental NFT who perceive DCs as unique products.

abstract = {Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this research explores how marketing professionals perceive AI adoption, examining the paradoxical tensions between technological fascination and professional resistance that challenge traditional TAM assumptions. This study draws on an exploratory qualitative approach involving 24 international marketing professionals (with 3–30 years of experience) from Africa, Europe, the United States, and the Gulf region. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews, using purposive sampling, and continued until theoretical saturation was achieved. Data analysis is based on a thematic content analysis method. Our analysis reveals three paradoxical perceptions (favorable, unfavorable, ambivalent) and identifies a novel five-category benefit taxonomy (technological, organizational, psychological, economic, communicational) alongside six barrier categories, challenging the linear adoption models prevalent in existing literature. The results show that professionals perceive AI primarily as a complementary tool that improves their individual performance while fundamentally transforming their profession. Theoretically, this study extends TAM by incorporating professional resistance and paradoxical adoption patterns, highlighting the limitations of linear acceptance models when applied to AI adoption within creative professional contexts. The study identifies the marketing experts’ perspectives on the future of their profession, the areas with high potential for AI impact, as well as the skills needed to remain relevant in the face of increasing integration of this technology. Practically, our findings provide a framework for managing AI adoption resistance in emerging markets and guidelines for organizations navigating the AI transformation paradox. Managerial implications are formulated to guide marketing professionals in the investment and use of AI, integrating it consistently into their daily practice.}

Design/methodology/approach
To better understand this dynamic, we outline Hermans and Hermans-Konopka’s (2010) framework of generative dialogical exchange, review relevant literature related to the implications of social media use by educators and argue for the importance of Reddit as a site of exploration into dialogical exchange. After describing our artifact selection, we offer relevant data and conclude with understanding and implications.
Findings
We argue that although online educator communities, particularly those on Reddit, offer opportunities for broad dialogical exchange for English educators, these can be marked by a push and pull between the expansion of the dialogical space and a tendency to rein it back in through reinforcing traditional power dynamics.

The reliability of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art expansive language model specializing in clinical reasoning and medical knowledge, remains largely unverified across non-English languages.
Objective
This study aims to compare fundamental clinical competencies between Japanese residents and GPT-4 by using the General Medicine In-Training Examination (GM-ITE).
Methods
We used the GPT-4 model provided by OpenAI and the GM-ITE examination questions for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 to conduct a comparative analysis. This analysis focused on evaluating the performance of individuals who were concluding their second year of residency in comparison to that of GPT-4. Given the current abilities of GPT-4, our study included only single-choice exam questions, excluding those involving audio, video, or image data. The assessment included 4 categories: general theory (professionalism and medical interviewing), symptomatology and clinical reasoning, physical examinations and clinical procedures, and specific diseases. Additionally, we categorized the questions into 7 specialty fields and 3 levels of difficulty, which were determined based on residents’ correct response rates.
Results
Upon examination of 137 GM-ITE questions in Japanese, GPT-4 scores were significantly higher than the mean scores of residents (residents: 55.8%, GPT-4: 70.1%; P<.001). In terms of specific disciplines, GPT-4 scored 23.5 points higher in the “specific diseases,” 30.9 points higher in “obstetrics and gynecology,” and 26.1 points higher in “internal medicine.” In contrast, GPT-4 scores in “medical interviewing and professionalism,” “general practice,” and “psychiatry” were lower than those of the residents, although this discrepancy was not statistically significant. Upon analyzing scores based on question difficulty, GPT-4 scores were 17.2 points lower for easy problems (P=.007) but were 25.4 and 24.4 points higher for normal and difficult problems, respectively (P<.001). In year-on-year comparisons, GPT-4 scores were 21.7 and 21.5 points higher in the 2020 (P=.01) and 2022 (P=.003) examinations, respectively, but only 3.5 points higher in the 2021 examinations (no significant difference).
Conclusions
In the Japanese language, GPT-4 also outperformed the average medical residents in the GM-ITE test, originally designed for them. Specifically, GPT-4 demonstrated a tendency to score higher on difficult questions with low resident correct response rates and those demanding a more comprehensive understanding of diseases. However, GPT-4 scored comparatively lower on questions that residents could readily answer, such as those testing attitudes toward patients and professionalism, as well as those necessitating an understanding of context and communication. These findings highlight the strengths and limitations of artificial intelligence applications in medical education and practice.}

Large language model, as an advanced natural language processing technology, has received attention from researchers related to Industry 5.0 due to its ease of use and powerful language processing capability. LLM is considered to be one of the key enabling technologies to drive the development of Industry 5.0 and has great application potential. After a rigorous review of existing approaches, we find there is few existing survey papers that focuses on how LLM will drive the development of Industry 5.0 applications. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the application of LLM in the field of Industry 5.0. Firstly, we conduct a literature review to explore the current state of research related to Industry 5.0. Subsequently, we analyze LLM-based technologies, synergizing LLMs with Industry 5.0 enablers and the applications of LLM in various domains of intelligent manufacturing. Finally, we explore the challenges of LLM in real-world scenarios and future research directions in the context of Industry 5.0.

Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown benefits in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the extrapolability of clinical trial results to general populations remains limited. This study evaluated the impact of early in-hospital SGLT2i prescription on ADHF outcomes in a real-world setting.
Methods
Prospective cohort study. Adults with ADHF from a third-level cardiovascular center were included. The primary analysis compared early SGLT2i (prescribed within 48hours of admission) versus late SGLT2i (prescribed after 48hours). A secondary analysis included patients not receiving in-hospital SGLT2i. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, 30-day improvement in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score, 30-day rehospitalization due to heart failure, and 30-day all-cause mortality.
Results
Of 2016 patients, early SGLT2i (≤ 48h) was initiated in 1275 (63.2%) patients, late SGLT2i in 346 (17.2%), and 395 (19.6%) did not receive in-hospital SGLT2i. After multivariate adjustment, early versus late SGLT2i use was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.37; 95%CI, 0.17-0.77) and reduced hospital stay (mean difference −5.70 days; 95%CI, −7.05 to −4.34). Similarly, early versus late or no in-hospital SGLT2i use was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.14-0.44), reduced hospital stay (mean difference −2.99 days; 95%CI, −4.05 to −1.92), and lower 30-day combined mortality/heart failure rehospitalization (RR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.53-0.98).
Conclusions
Early in-hospital SGLT2i prescription was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes in ADHF in a real-world setting.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Aunque los inhibidores del cotransportador de sodio-glucosa tipo 2 (iSGLT2) han mostrado beneficios en la insuficiencia cardiaca aguda descompensada (ICAD), la extrapolabilidad de los beneficios observados en los ensayos clínicos a la población general sigue siendo limitada. Este estudio evaluó el impacto de la prescripción temprana de iSGLT2 durante la estancia hospitalaria sobre los desenlaces de la ICAD en un contexto del mundo real.
Métodos
Estudio de cohorte prospectiva. Se incluyeron adultos con ICAD de un centro cardiovascular de tercer nivel. El análisis primario comparó iSGLT2 temprano (prescrito en las 48 horas siguientes al ingreso) frente a iSGLT2 tardío (prescrito después de 48 horas). Un análisis secundario incluyó a los pacientes que no recibieron iSGLT2 durante su estancia. El desenlace primario fue la mortalidad intrahospitalaria. Los desenlaces secundarios incluyeron la duración de la estancia hospitalaria, la mejoría a los 30 días en la puntuación del Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, la rehospitalización a los 30 días por IC y la mortalidad por todas las causas a los 30 días.
Resultados
De 2.016 pacientes, se inició iSGLT2 temprano (≤ 48h) en 1.275 (63,2%) pacientes, iSGLT2 tardío en 346 (17,2%), y 395 (19,6%) no recibieron iSGLT2 intrahospitalario. Tras el ajuste multivariante, el uso temprano frente al tardío de iSGLT2 se asoció con una disminución de la mortalidad intrahospitalaria (RR=0,37; IC95%, 0,17-0,77) y una reducción de la estancia hospitalaria (diferencia media −5,70 días; IC95%, −7,05 a −4,34). Del mismo modo, el uso temprano de iSGLT2 en comparación con el uso tardío o la ausencia de uso se asoció con una disminución de la mortalidad hospitalaria (RR=0,25; IC95%, 0,14-0,44), una reducción de la estancia hospitalaria (diferencia media −2,99 días; IC95%, −4,05 a −1,92) y una reducción de la combinación de mortalidad y rehospitalización por IC a los 30 días (RR=0,72; IC95%, 0,53-0,98).
Conclusiones
La prescripción temprana intrahospitalaria de iSGLT2 se asoció con mejores desenlaces cardiovasculares en la ICAD en un contexto del mundo real.}

The development of surgical skills is a key component of the medical education curriculum. While simulation-based medical education approaches are increasingly adopted to facilitate skills development in a safe, standardized and realistic manner, mental imagery (MI) has been considered as an emerging approach for surgical skills development. MI is defined as the mental rehearsal of tasks without motor performance and has demonstrated effective skills development in industries such as elite sport and aviation. However, its benefit has yet to be explored and utilized in the medical school curriculum. This scoping review seeks to evaluate the current literature to characterize efficacy of MI interventions for the surgical skills development of medical students.
Methods
A scoping review was performed following a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Emcare databases. Articles evaluating the outcomes related to the impact of MI interventions on the development of technical and nontechnical surgical skills among medical students were included.
Results
MI-based programs among medical students improve certain areas of technical and nontechnical surgical skills performance such as in laparoscopic performance, fluidity and with co-benefits of improved stress management and low cost. However, inconsistencies were observed in findings across studies, with mixed results across the technical and nontechnical surgical skills assessed. This was largely attributed to significant study heterogeneity of the underlying evidence.
Conclusions
Despite the emerging evidence suggesting MI-based programs as an effective adjunct to the current surgical skills development, there are important limitations to the quality of the evidence. Our scoping review highlights the need for prospective research with standardized MI programs assessing surgical skills at the expected scope of competency for medical students to further characterize the utility of MI-based programs in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) surgical skills curriculum, particularly in areas of medical knowledge, professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills.}

Typically, cross-domain measures of ecological and health-related factors with relevance to public policy and programming are analyzed either in isolation or in targeted models assessing bivariate interactions. Here, we capitalize on a large provincial data set and machine learning to identify the sociodemographic, experiential, behavioral, and other health-related factors most strongly associated with levels of subjective enthusiasm for the future in a large sample of elementary and secondary school students.
Objective
The aim of this study was to identify the sociodemographic, experiential, behavioral, and other health-related factors associated with enthusiasm for the future in elementary and secondary school students using machine learning.
Methods
We analyzed data from 13,661 participants in the 2019 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS) (grades 7-12) with complete data for our primary outcome: self-reported levels of enthusiasm for the future. We used 50 variables as model predictors, including demographics, perception of school experience (i.e., school connectedness and academic performance), physical activity and quantity of sleep, substance use, and physical and mental health indicators. Models were built using a nonlinear decision tree–based machine learning algorithm called extreme gradient boosting to classify students as indicating either high or low levels of enthusiasm. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were used to interpret the generated models, providing a ranking of feature importance and revealing any nonlinear or interactive effects of the input variables.
Results
The top 3 contributors to higher self-rated enthusiasm for the future were higher self-rated physical health (SHAP value=0.62), feeling that one is able to discuss problems or feelings with their parents (SHAP value=0.49), and school belonging (SHAP value=0.32). Additionally, subjective social status at school was a top feature and showed nonlinear effects, with benefits to predicted enthusiasm present in the mid-to-high range of values.
Conclusions
Using machine learning, we identified key factors related to self-reported enthusiasm for the future in a large sample of young students: perceived physical health, subjective school social status and connectedness, and quality of relationship with parents. A focus on perceptions of physical health and school connectedness should be considered central to improving the well-being of youth at the population level.}

We presented participants with pairs of visual clutters and recorded their electroencephalography during an emotion judgement task. In an upright flanker condition where both the central target face and flanker faces were upright faces, participants were less likely to report seeing the target face, and their P300 was weakened, compared to a scrambled flanker condition where scrambled face images were used as flankers. Additionally, at ∼ 120 ms post-stimulus, a posterior negativity was found for the upright compared to scrambled flanker condition, however only for fearful face targets. We concluded that early neural responses seem to be affected by the perceptual characteristics of both target and flanker stimuli whereas later-stage neural activity is associated with post-perceptual evaluation of the stimuli in this visual crowding paradigm.}

abstract = {Background
Preeclampsia is prevalent in women with diabetes, but the mechanism is unclear. We previously found that oxidized, glycated lipoproteins robustly upregulated soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1), a key mediator of preeclampsia. Here, we determined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and its subtypes in sFlt1 regulation in placental trophoblasts, and whether this mechanism might mediate the effect of modified lipoproteins.
Methods
Cultured human HTR8/SVneo and BeWo trophoblasts were treated with the PKC activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) for 24h, ± PKC inhibitors GF109203X (general), Ro31-8220 (PKCα-selective), LY333531 (PKCβ-selective) and rottlerin (PKCδ-selective). The effect of ‘heavily oxidized, glycated’ low-density lipoproteins (HOG-LDL) vs. native LDL (N-LDL), ± high glucose (30 mM), was evaluated in HTR8/SVneo cells. sFlt1 secretion (ELISA), mRNA expression (RT-qPCR), and cellular PKC activity were measured.
Results
PMA stimulated robust sFlt1 release and mRNA expression in both cell lines; these effects were inhibited by GF109203X, Ro31-8220 and LY333531 in a concentration-dependent manner. Rottlerin inhibited sFlt1 in BeWo, but modestly enhanced it in HTR8/SVneo cells. HOG-LDL enhanced PKC activity vs. N-LDL in HTR8/SVneo cells. Also, HOG-LDL, but not high glucose, significantly increased sFlt1 secretion and mRNA expression; this response was inhibited by GF109203X, Ro31-8220 and LY333531 at concentrations comparable to those that blocked PMA induction of sFlt1.
Conclusion
Modified lipoproteins upregulate sFlt1 in trophoblasts via a PKC-mediated mechanism, involving at least α and β isoforms. The data suggest potential therapeutic targets to reduce the risk of preeclampsia in women with diabetes.}

abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and is related to other diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Fucoidan has been shown to exert potential anti-obesity effects. Hence, the present study systematically reviewed recent articles on the anti-obesity effects of fucoidan intake in obese animal models. The PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases were searched for relevant articles. Sixty-nine articles were identified from the initial literature search. Among them, 17 articles were selected for data extraction. The methodological quality was evaluated using the SYRCLE RoB tool, and the R software was used to perform a meta-analysis. The outcomes of the meta-analysis were alterations in body weight, blood lipid profiles (triglycerides [TG], total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]), obesity-related hormones (adiponectin, leptin), and inflammation markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF- α]). The meta-analysis indicated that fucoidan intake significantly reduced body weight (standardized mean difference [95% confidence interval]: −2.44 [−3.17, −1.72]), TG (−2.83 [−3.49, −2.17]), TC (−4.39 [−5.83, −2.96]), LDL-C (−2.91 [−3.97, −1.84]), and leptin (−5.71 [−8.01, −3.40]) compared with the control. Moreover, fucoidan intake was associated with significant improvement in adiponectin (5.09 [3.23, 6.96]), leptin (−5.71 [−8.01, −3.40]), and TNF-α levels (−2.97 [−4.07, −1.87]). Subgroup analyses of the outcomes, including sources, intervention type, duration, molecular size, and dose, were performed. Fucoidan supplementation was sufficiently effective in preventing obesity at concentrations above 50 mg/kg, intervention duration of <12 weeks, and low-molecular size (<10 kDa). Therefore, fucoidan supplementation has the potential to prevent obesity.}

The study compares the theoretical advantages of ontologies with their practical applications, highlighting discrepancies and barriers to adoption. Key challenges include data issues, implementation difficulties, and cultural barriers. Based on these findings, this paper proposes strategic measures to overcome these obstacles and facilitate ontology-driven decision support.}

To improve SMP-based emulsions, we used food-grade amino acids as co-surfactants. Lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan lowered the water-oil interfacial tension. Tryptophan was the most effective, providing sufficient electrostatic repulsion to stabilize emulsion droplets by adsorbing onto the oil surface and becoming protonated at pH 3. However, tryptophan was counterproductive to stabilize SMP-based emulsions between pH 4 and 5. A minimum concentration (0.4 w/v%) of tryptophan prevented droplet coalescence and creaming. Incorporating tryptophan with SMP before emulsification resulted in larger droplets compared to post-emulsification addition. Tryptophan-costabilized emulsions induced flocculation with κ-carrageenan via electrostatic adsorption but showed higher compatibility with polysaccharides with weaker charges. Tryptophan enhanced oxidative stability of unsaturated lipids creating a cationic shield to repel transition metals in the aqueous phase and stabilizing cleavage of lipid hydroperoxides.}

Polarization is common in politics and public opinion. It is believed to be shaped by media as well as ideologies, and often incited by misinformation. However, little is known about the microscopic dynamics behind polarization and the resulting social tensions. By coupling opinion formation with the strategy selection in different social dilemmas, we reveal how success at an individual level transforms to global consensus or lack thereof. When defection carries with it the fear of punishment in the absence of greed, as in the stag-hunt game, opinion fragmentation is the smallest. Conversely, if defection promises a higher payoff and also evokes greed, like in the prisoner’s dilemma and snowdrift game, consensus is more difficult to attain. Our research thus challenges the top-down narrative of social tensions, showing they might originate from fundamental principles at individual level, like the desire to prevail in pairwise evolutionary comparisons.}

Second, by approaching the concept of digital technology inclusively, we seek to elaborate on scholarly knowledge related to technology convergence, that is, the spillover and blending of technologies, in recreational sports. The data consist of qualitative online survey responses from 1011 runners and were analyzed via abductive content analysis. As a result, we identified three dispositional frames (running for training, health and recreation, and sociality) and three technological frames (technology as verificator, motivator, and safeguard), the combinations of which highlight the often multifaceted, layered, and situational relationship people have with recreational running and technology use.}

abstract = {Purpose
To assess the ability of ChatGPT-4, an automated Chatbot powered by artificial intelligence, to answer common patient questions concerning the Latarjet procedure for patients with anterior shoulder instability and compare this performance with Google Search Engine.
Methods
Using previously validated methods, a Google search was first performed using the query “Latarjet.” Subsequently, the top 10 frequently asked questions (FAQs) and associated sources were extracted. ChatGPT-4 was then prompted to provide the top 10 FAQs and answers concerning the procedure. This process was repeated to identify additional FAQs requiring discrete-numeric answers to allow for a comparison between ChatGPT-4 and Google. Discrete, numeric answers were subsequently assessed for accuracy on the basis of the clinical judgment of 2 fellowship-trained sports medicine surgeons who were blinded to search platform.
Results
Mean (± standard deviation) accuracy to numeric-based answers was 2.9 ± 0.9 for ChatGPT-4 versus 2.5 ± 1.4 for Google (P = .65). ChatGPT-4 derived information for answers only from academic sources, which was significantly different from Google Search Engine (P = .003), which used only 30% academic sources and websites from individual surgeons (50%) and larger medical practices (20%). For general FAQs, 40% of FAQs were found to be identical when comparing ChatGPT-4 and Google Search Engine. In terms of sources used to answer these questions, ChatGPT-4 again used 100% academic resources, whereas Google Search Engine used 60% academic resources, 20% surgeon personal websites, and 20% medical practices (P = .087).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 demonstrated the ability to provide accurate and reliable information about the Latarjet procedure in response to patient queries, using multiple academic sources in all cases. This was in contrast to Google Search Engine, which more frequently used single-surgeon and large medical practice websites. Despite differences in the resources accessed to perform information retrieval tasks, the clinical relevance and accuracy of information provided did not significantly differ between ChatGPT-4 and Google Search Engine.
Clinical Relevance
Commercially available large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT-4, can perform diverse information retrieval tasks on-demand. An important medical information retrieval application for LLMs consists of the ability to provide comprehensive, relevant, and accurate information for various use cases such as investigation about a recently diagnosed medical condition or procedure. Understanding the performance and abilities of LLMs for use cases has important implications for deployment within health care settings.}
