While many of these tools claim to offer therapeutic advice, their unregulated status and lack of systematic evaluation create risks for users, particularly vulnerable individuals. This viewpoint article highlights the urgent need for a standardized framework to assess and demonstrate the safety, ethics, and evidence basis of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts. Drawing on clinical expertise, research, co-design experience, and the World Health Organization’s guidance, the authors propose key evaluation criteria: adherence to ethical principles, evidence-based responses, conversational skills, safety protocols, and accessibility. Implementation challenges, including setting output criteria without one “right answer,” evaluating multiturn conversations, and involving experts for oversight at scale, are explored. The authors advocate for greater consumer engagement in chatbot evaluation to ensure that these tools address users’ needs effectively and responsibly, emphasizing the ethical obligation of developers to prioritize safety and a strong base in empirical evidence.}

Introduction
Chatbot Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT), a multimodal generative AI, has been studied for potential applications in healthcare, including otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. In this study, authors investigates the consistency of ChatGPT-4o in analyzing clinical fiberoptic videos of suspected laryngeal malignancies compared to expert clinicians.
Methods
This experimental study involved twenty patients with primary laryngeal disease consulting at a tertiary academic center. Data, including laryngeal fiberoptic video examinations, were retrospectively analyzed using the ChatGPT-4o application programming interface. Responses were assessed for diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and clinical recommendations. Three otolaryngology-head and neck consultants independently evaluated ChatGPT-4o’s performance using the Artificial Intelligence Performance Instrument and a five-point Likert scale for complexity and consistency.
Results
ChatGPT-4o identified malignant diagnoses as the primary diagnosis in 30% of cases, while proposing malignancies as one of the top three diagnoses in 90% of cases. Despite high sensitivity, specificity was limited. The mean consistency score for image analysis was 2.36 ± 1.13, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.890 (P = 0.03). The model showed a tendency to prioritize text over visual data, limiting the improvement in diagnostic accuracy from video input.
Conclusion
While ChatGPT-4o demonstrates potential in analyzing laryngeal pathologies through multimodal data, current limitations in specificity and image interpretation indicate the need for further refinement. Ongoing advancements could enhance its integration into clinical workflows, supporting accurate diagnoses and decision-making in otolaryngology.}

In the study, a content analysis was conducted on the curriculum of 65 undergraduate tourism and hospitality management programs, followed by an analysis of data from 28 academics to explore the role of emerging technologies in the curriculum. We have observed six core topics. Technology courses had the lowest proportion. We further observe four categories of skills that emerging technologies may provide students, highlighting their potential to shape future career opportunities. Building on these findings, the current study contributes to the literature by linking these skill sets — digital and technological, theoretical, operational, and managerial — to emerging job roles such as virtual reality tour designers, competent tourism developers, and AI-driven marketing specialists. Furthermore, the study identifies the domains where emerging technologies have the most relevance and outlines which purpose they may be included in the tourism and hospitality curriculum as a course. Thus, it forwards previous studies emphasizing the importance of emerging technologies. The study also suggests the implications for the literature, practice, and public policies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Difficulty removing central venous ports in children is generally uncommon. We present a rare case of intraoperative difficulty with port removal that resulted in catheter breakage.
Case presentation
An 18-year-old girl presented for port removal nearly six years after placement. The catheter was stuck intraoperatively and despite increased tension, proximal dissection, and extraction attempts with a wire, a portion of the catheter broke off intravascularly. Since intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed that neither end of the catheter had free intravascular motion, the catheter was left in place. The patient has had no apparent complications from this retained portion of the catheter.
Conclusion
It is uncommon to have great difficulty removing a port in a child but in cases where the catheter is stuck, multiple techniques can be attempted intraoperatively to improve chances of removal. If the catheter breaks intraoperatively but has no free intravascular motion on fluoroscopy, it may be reasonable to leave the retained fragment in place and obtain interval imaging to ensure the fragment has not moved.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are artificial intelligence programs designed to interpret and respond to text based input These programs can improve output based on prompting and tailored prompt engineering. Multiple studies have assessed the ability of various LLMs to perform on medical exams at different levels of training. The newest version of ChatGPT, GPT-4, allows image recognition which is relevant for many questions on orthopedic surgery exams. Performance of GPT-4, and the potential for LLMs to learn from prior exams remains unclear. The present study analyzed ChatGPT-4 performance on the 2023 hand surgery Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Self-Assessment Examination (SAE) before and after prompting with 5 previous versions of the test. It was hypothesized that GPT-4 would pass the exam and improve performance after prompting.
Methods
GPT-4 was tested with all text and image-based questions from the 2023 hand surgery SAE. Video-based questions were excluded. GPT-4 was then provided with questions, answers, and explanations from 5 previous SAEs from 2014 to 2020 and retested on the 2023 SAE text and imaging questions. Responses from GPT-4 on prompted and unprompted tests were recorded and compared.
Results
Both prompted and unprompted versions of ChatGPT-4 exceeded SAE exam passing requirement of >50 % correct response rate. GPT-4 answered 67 % of all questions correctly unprompted and 71 % of all questions correctly after prompting (p = 0.51). Sub-analysis demonstrated GPT-4 answered 66 % of image-based questions correctly after prompting, compared to 56 % before prompting (p = 0.25). GPT-4 answered 75 % of text only questions correctly before prompting and 74 % correctly after prompting (p = 1.0). Fischer's exact test on total questions, image only, and text only showed no statistically significant differences between prompted and unprompted versions of GPT-4.
Conclusion
GPT-4 demonstrated the ability to analyze orthopedic information, answer specialty-specific questions, and exceed the passing threshold of 50 % on the 2023 Hand Surgery Self-Assessment Exam. However, prompting GPT-4 with previous SAEs did not statistically significantly improve performance. With continued advancements in AI and deep learning, large language models may someday become resources in test simulation and knowledge checks in the realm of hand surgery.}

The dataset was curated through the running of a prototyping hackathon designed to assess the abilities and performance of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the early stages of engineering design. This assessment involved comparing ChatGPT's performance to that of experienced engineering students in a hackathon setting, where participants competed by making a prototype that fires a NERF dart as far as possible. In this setup, all ideas, concepts, strategies, and actions undertaken by the AI-controlled team were autonomously generated by the ChatGPT, without human intervention or guidance, but implemented by two participants. Five self-directed baseline teams competed against the AI team. The dataset comprises 116 prototype entries and 433 edges (connection) that enable comparative analysis of design practices and performance between the team instructed solely by generative AI and baseline teams of experienced engineering design students. Prototypes and their attribute data were captured using Pro2booth, an online prototype capture platform running on participants' phones and computers. The dataset includes a transcript of the conversation between ChatGPT and the team responsible for implementing its recommendations, featuring 97 exchanges of prompts and responses. It contains the initial prompt used to instruct the AI, the objective and rules of the hackathon and the objective performance of teams, showing the ChatGPT team finishing 2nd among six teams. To the authors' knowledge, the TrollLabs Open dataset is the first and only open resource that directly compares the performance of generative AI with human teams in an engineering design context. Thus, it is intended to be a valuable resource to design researchers, engineering and design students, educators, and industry professionals seeking to find strategies for implementing generative AI tools in their design processes. By offering a comprehensive data collection, the dataset enables external researchers to conduct in-depth analyses that could highlight the practical implications of integrating generative AI in design practices, possibly providing an overview of its limitations and presenting recommendations for improved integration in the design process.}

abstract = {Introduction
ASSORT (AI-based Symptom Stratification in Ophthalmology for Rapid Triage) is a GPT-4-based triage tool designed to assess ophthalmic emergencies using a three-tier color-coded system. This study compares ASSORT to the Rescue triage method, using the ophthalmologist’s final assessment as the reference standard.
Materials and methods
A prospective study was conducted at the Créteil University Hospital from April to June 2024. Each patient underwent triage using ASSORT, followed by the Rescue triage method. Both tools used the same color-coding system to stratify severity: yellow for emergency cases, green for urgent cases, and white for non-urgent cases. An examining ophthalmologist in their final year of residency performed the final assessment. Concordance between the ophthalmologist and each of the tools was analyzed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient, alongside precision and recall metrics.
Results
Fifty-one patients were included. Case severities were distributed as follows: 22/51 white, 27/51 green, and 2/51 yellow, with conjunctivitis (17.5 %) and corneal abrasions (12.5 %) being the two most common presentations. ASSORT demonstrated moderate agreement with the ophthalmologist (κ = 0.54), whereas Rescue showed stronger concordance (κ = 0.85). ASSORT tended to overestimate urgency, assigning more yellow codes than the ophthalmologist. McNemar’s test confirmed significant misclassification by ASSORT (p = 0.0156), while Rescue showed no significant deviation (p = 0.5).
Conclusion
While the small sample size limits generalizability, ASSORT shows potential for AI-driven ophthalmic triage but currently overestimates severity compared to the ophthalmologist. Further refinements such as reinforcement learning and multimodal input, as well as large-scale validation are needed to improve accuracy and reduce unnecessary emergency classifications before clinical implementation.}

However, limited funding, restricted access to cutting-edge technology, bureaucratic barriers, and constantly changing scientific policies continue to hinder its full integration into the international scientific ecosystem. Latin American scientists also suffer from limitations in their visibility on the global stage, often leading to exclusion. Despite these challenges, many success cases in the region highlight how strategic actions based on planned and sustained investments, international collaborations, and a relevant scientific policy positively impact scientific progress. Through this path, Latin America may not only overcome existing barriers but also position itself as a fundamental player in the scientific stage.}

A comparative approach is adopted, exploring student experiences at Zayed University (ZU) in the UAE and King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Saudi Arabia. The principal variables of interest, including Expected Benefits (EB), University Support (US), Ethical Awareness (EA), and Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE), are examined, with particular attention to their direct and mediated influences through Behavioral Intention (BI) on student satisfaction (SS). Data were collected through surveys and analyzed using SmartPLS-4. The findings reveal notable similarities and differences between the two universities. At both ZU and KAU, BI demonstrated the strongest direct influence on SS, confirming its central role. EB and TSE significantly impacted SS both directly and indirectly through BI in both contexts, although their effects were stronger at KAU. Conversely, US and EA showed no significant direct or mediated effects on SS at either institution. R2 values indicated substantial explanatory power of the model, and Q2 values confirmed strong predictive relevance. These results suggest that while the core drivers (BI, EB, TSE) are consistent across contexts, institutional and cultural factors shape their relative impact. The findings highlight the importance of integrating GenAI tools into teaching practices and emphasize the role of student motivation, confidence, and institutional support in fostering effective adoption and enhancing learning experiences. Institutions should prioritize enhancing students' perceived benefits and technological self-efficacy by providing practical training and demonstrating the value of GenAI tools. These factors significantly influence student satisfaction and engagement, particularly in culturally distinct settings.}

Demand for mental health services exceeds available resources globally, and access to diagnosis and evidence-based treatment is affected by long delays. Digital mental health technologies present an opportunity to reimagine the delivery of mental health support by providing innovative, effective, and tailored approaches that meet people's individual preferences and goals. These technologies also present new challenges, however, and efforts must be made to ensure they are safe and effective. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have launched a partnership, funded by Wellcome, that explores regulation and evaluation of digital mental health technologies. This Viewpoint describes a series of key challenges across the regulatory and health technology assessment pathways and aims to facilitate discussions to ensure that approaches to regulation and evaluation are informed by patients, the public, and professionals working within mental health. We invite partners from across the mental health community to engage with, collaborate with, and provide scrutiny of this project to ensure it delivers the best possible outcomes.}

abstract = {Purpose
The research aims to unravel the dynamics of academic integrity in the ChatGPT era by analyzing critical predictors such as personal best goals (PBG), academic competence and workplace stress. Furthermore, it examines how ChatGPT adoption acts as a moderating factor, potentially influencing the relationship between these predictors and academic integrity, offering a nuanced understanding of its impact in academic settings.
Design/methodology/approach
Relying on the social cognitive theory, the authors adopt a quantitative approach through an online survey to explore the impact of key variables – PBG, academic competence and workplace stress, as well as ChatGPT adoption on integrity – by analyzing data from responses collected through Academic Social Networking Sites.
Findings
The study found that PBG related positively to academic integrity among academic staff. However, workplace stress had a negative impact on academic integrity, while academic competence failed to report any effect. With the integration of ChatGPT adoption as a moderator into the model, the authors found the association between PBG and academic integrity altered to be negative. The ChatGPT adoption-moderated interactions of academic competence and workplace stress on academic integrity were significant.
Practical implications
The findings suggest that institutions should provide training on the ethical and effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT to ensure they support rather than hinder academic integrity. Additionally, organizations should focus on stress management initiatives and fostering a balanced approach to personal goal setting to mitigate the potential negative impacts of ChatGPT adoption on ethical behavior.
Originality/value
This attempt is both timely and pioneering, addressing a clear gap in the current body of literature. As limited studies have examined the role of ChatGPT in academic settings, this work stands out as one of the earliest to investigate how educators and researchers incorporate OpenAI tools into their professional practices.}

Production of hydrogen directly on floating wind turbines is a scalable and modular approach to harnessing these wind resources. This paper presents a design for a floating 15 MW semi-submersible offshore turbine integrated with electrolyzers for hydrogen production and storage tanks. The modified configuration's hydrodynamic performance is simulated under combined aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading conditions. The modifications led to a 4–5 % increase in pitch and roll inertia of the platform. The maximum acceleration at the nacelle increased by less than 10 %, remaining within acceptable limits, and the maximum power output changed by less than 2 % across all load cases. Mooring line tensions increased by approximately 3 %, demonstrating minimal impact on overall stability. The study demonstrates that onboard hydrogen integration can be achieved without compromising the dynamic response or energy production performance of the floating platform, supporting its viability as a decentralized offshore hydrogen production solution.}

To evaluate and compare the performance of human test takers and three artificial intelligence (AI) models—OpenAI o1, ChatGPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Flash—on ophthalmology board–style questions, focusing on overall accuracy and performance stratified by ophthalmic subspecialty and cognitive complexity level.
Design
A cross-sectional study.
Subjects
Five hundred questions sourced from the Basic and Clinical Science Course (BCSC) and EyeQuiz question banks.
Methods
Three large language models interpreted the questions using standardized prompting procedures. Subanalysis was performed, stratifying the questions by subspecialty and complexity defined by the Buckwalter taxonomic schema. Statistical analysis, including the analysis of variance and McNemar test, was conducted to assess performance differences.
Main Outcome Measures
Accuracy of responses for each model and human test takers, stratified by subspecialty and cognitive complexity.
Results
OpenAI o1 achieved the highest overall accuracy (423/500, 84.6%), significantly outperforming GPT-4o (331/500, 66.2%; P < 0.001) and Gemini (301/500, 60.2%; P < 0.001). o1 demonstrated superior performance on both BCSC (228/250, 91.2%) and EyeQuiz (195/250, 78.0%) questions compared with GPT-4o (BCSC: 183/250, 73.2%; EyeQuiz: 148/250, 59.2%) and Gemini (BCSC: 163/250, 65.2%; EyeQuiz: 137/250, 54.8%). On BCSC questions, human performance was lower (64.5%) than Gemini 1.5 Flash (65.2%), GPT-4o (73.2%), and OpenAI o1 (91.2%) (P < 0.001). OpenAI o1 outperformed other models in each of the nine ophthalmic subfields and three cognitive complexity levels.
Conclusions
OpenAI o1 outperformed GPT-4o, Gemini, and human test takers in answering ophthalmology board–style questions from two question banks and across three complexity levels. These findings highlight advances in AI technology and OpenAI o1’s growing potential as an adjunct in ophthalmic education and care.

Hepatorenal syndrome – Acute Kidney Injury (HRS-AKI) is a severe complication of decompensated cirrhosis that is challenging to predict. Large language models are robust for natural language processing. We aimed to determine if clinical sentiment in unstructured text can be derived by LLMs and used to improve prediction of Hepatorenal syndrome – Acute Kidney Injury (HRS-AKI) over traditional predictors alone.
Methods
Cohort study consisting of adult patients admitted to a single academic medical center with decompensated cirrhosis and AKI. We used Microsoft Azure OpenAI GPT-4o to derive a sentiment score ranging from 0 to 1 for HRS-AKI, and conduct natural language processing (NLP) extraction of clinical terms associated with HRS-AKI in admission notes. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) was compared in logistic regression models incorporating structured variables with versus without sentiment scores and NLP-extracted clinical terms.
Results
In our cohort of 314 participants, median age was 60, 48% were female, median MELD was 31. Higher sentiment score was associated with the diagnosis of HRS-AKI (OR 1.52 per 0.1, 95% CI 1.12-2.14) in multivariate models. AUROC using structured clinical covariates alone was 0.63. With the addition of GPT-4o derived sentiment score and clinical terms to structured covariates, the final model yielded an improved AUROC of 0.79 (p<0.01).
Conclusion
Clinical texts contain data that are difficult to extract using standard methodologies. Sentiment analysis and NLP-based variable derivation with GPT-4o in clinical application is feasible and can improve the prediction of HRS-AKI over structured data alone.}

Duodenum inversum is a rare congenital anatomical variant and presents a myriad of clinical challenges. This case presentation highlights a unique case of symptomatic duodenum inversum diagnosed in the second decade of life requiring operative intervention.
Case presentation
We present the case of a thirteen-year-old male who presented with one year of intermittent abdominal pain with associated bilious emesis. Diagnostic work-up included multiple abdominal ultrasounds and abdominal radiographs which only revealed constipation. Despite adequate bowel regimen, patient's symptoms persisted. Duodenum inversum was diagnosed on a fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal study and the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room to evaluate for concurrent midgut volvulus and malrotation. A diagnostic laparoscopy revealed fibrotic adhesive bands contributing to partial duodenal obstruction. Surgical resection of these bands alleviated the obstruction and resolved the patient's symptoms with no recurrence noted on post-operative follow-up.
Conclusion
In cases of duodenum inversum, recognition through diagnostic tools like fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal studies is critical. While initial medical management may suffice for mild cases, surgical intervention remains the cornerstone for severe cases, particularly when obstruction is evident, emphasizing the necessity of tailored approaches based on clinical severity.}

abstract = {Introduction
India accounts for 26 % of global tuberculosis (TB) cases, with delayed diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and drug resistance exacerbating disease transmission. Conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains time-consuming, while molecular tools like the Xpert MTB/RIF assay—though rapid—are limited to detecting MTB and rifampicin (RIF) resistance. Testing for isoniazid (INH) and second-line drugs requires the costly Xpert MTB/XDR assay. Although line probe assays (LPAs) identifies first- and second-line drug resistance, their accessibility is restricted to specialized laboratories. This underscores the need for a rapid, cost-effective alternative to diagnose resistance to INH and fluoroquinolones (FQs).
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed at the Department of Microbiology, AIIMS Bhubaneswar, and the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL), Cuttack, from March 2022 to April 2023. MTB isolates (n = 123) were analyzed using LPAs (Hain Lifescience's Genotype MTBDRplus and Genotype MTBDRsl) and multiplex allele-specific (MAS) PCR. The MAS-PCR targeted mutations in katG codon 315 and the inhA-15 promoter region for INH resistance, and gyrA codon 94 for FQ resistance.
Results
MAS-PCR identified INH resistance in 28/123 (22.76 %) isolates.

However, their inter-observer and inter-scanner variability has not been investigated in dogs, limiting the accuracy and clinical applicability of these indices. The objectives of this cross-sectional observational prospective study were to assess the inter-observer and inter-scanner variability of RRI and RPI and to determine whether operator experience influences measurement accuracy. RRI and RPI were measured in the left kidney of 10 client-owned dogs by four different operators with varying levels of experience, using two different ultrasound scanners. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two ultrasound scanners for both RRI and RPI were good to excellent in all four observers (ICC > 0.75 and p < 0.05). Similarly, a good to excellent correlation coefficient was observed between the measurements of the four operators for both indices across each ultrasound scanner (ICC > 0.75 and p < 0.05). These findings indicate that RRI and RPI are feasible and reproducible measurements with good inter-scanner and inter-observer agreement, regardless of operator experience. However, achieving high reproducibility requires adequate training and the use of a standardized protocol with strict but adaptable settings tailored to each patient's characteristics.}

abstract = {Background: Neuromyths are widespread among educators, which raises concerns about misconceptions regarding the (neural) principles underlying learning in the educator population. With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, educators are increasingly relying on these for lesson planning and professional development. Therefore, if LLMs correctly identify neuromyths, they may help to dispute related misconceptions. Method: We evaluated whether LLMs can correctly identify neuromyths and whether they may hint educators to neuromyths in applied contexts when users ask questions comprising related misconceptions. Additionally, we examined whether explicitly prompting LLMs to base their answer on scientific evidence or to correct unsupported assumptions would decrease errors in identifying neuromyths. Results: LLMs outperformed humans in identifying neuromyth statements as used in previous studies. However, when presented with applied user-like questions comprising misconceptions, they struggled to highlight or dispute these. Interestingly, explicitly asking LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions increased the likelihood that misconceptions were flagged considerably, while prompting the models to rely on scientific evidence had only little effects. Conclusion: While LLMs outperformed humans at identifying isolated neuromyth statements, they struggled to hint users towards the same misconception when they were included in more applied user-like questions—presumably due to LLMs’ tendency toward sycophantic responses. This limitation suggests that, despite their potential, LLMs are not yet a reliable safeguard against the spread of neuromyths in educational settings. However, when users explicitly prompt LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions—an approach that may initially seem counterintuitive–this effectively reduced sycophantic responses.}

This study investigates the attitudes of English major students toward peer feedback in academic writing classes, using Sociocultural Theory as the analytical framework. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, the study first surveyed 142 students to quantify general trends in attitudes, followed by semi-structured interviews with 12 participants to explore the sociocultural dimensions underpinning those attitudes. Findings indicate that while students generally perceive peer feedback as beneficial for their academic development, their engagement is notably shaped by sociocultural factors including face-saving norms, perceived proficiency hierarchies, and interpersonal relationship dynamics. Significantly, students strongly preferred anonymity in peer feedback to mitigate emotional discomfort and enhance objectivity. The study concludes that incorporating anonymous feedback mechanisms in peer review activities substantially addresses sociocultural constraints and improves student engagement, thus representing a key strategy for effective writing instruction in EFL contexts. These insights underscore the importance of culturally responsive pedagogical practices and provide clear implications for instructional design in writing pedagogy.}

At the primary analysis of the EV-302 trial, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab (EV+P) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC).
Patients and methods
We present an updated analysis of efficacy and safety in the overall population, with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, providing an additional year of follow-up since the primary analysis.
Results
The median PFS by blinded independent central review was 12.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-16.6 months] for the EV+P arm and 6.3 months (95% CI 6.2-6.5 months) for the chemotherapy arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.57]. The median OS was 33.8 months (95% CI 26.1-39.3 months) for the EV+P arm and 15.9 months (95% CI 13.6-18.3 months) for the chemotherapy arm (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.61). Safety data with an additional year of follow-up were consistent with those of the primary analysis.
Conclusion
The continued survival benefit with EV+P compared with chemotherapy in this updated analysis reinforces EV+P as the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with la/mUC.}

abstract = {Purpose
To measure the accuracy and cost of a proof-of-concept prompted large language model (LLM) to route procedure requests to the appropriate phone number or pager at a single large academic hospital.
Materials and Methods
At a large academic hospital, existing teams, pager/phone numbers, and schedules were used to create text-based rules for procedure requests. A prompted LLM was created to route procedure requests at specific days and times to the appropriate teams. The prompted LLM was tested on 250 “in-scope” requests (explicitly defined by provided rules) and 25 “out-of-scope” requests using generative pretrained transformer (GPT)–3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models from OpenAI and 4 open-weight models.
Results
The prompted LLM correctly routed 96.4% of in-scope and 76.0% of out-of-scope requests using GPT-4, which outperformed all other models (P < .001). All models demonstrated worse performance for requests during evening and weekend hours (P < .001). OpenAI application programming interface costs were approximately $0.03 per request for GPT-4 and $0.0006 per request for GPT-3.5-turbo.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the accuracy of low-cost prompted LLMs to appropriately route procedure requests in a large academic hospital system. A similar approach may be used to help clinicians navigate a radiology phone tree or as a tool to help reading room coordinators route requests effectively.}

abstract = {Background
Cognitive assessment is an important component of applied psychology, but limited access and high costs make these evaluations challenging.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) to create personalized artificial intelligence–based verbal comprehension tests (AI-BVCTs) for assessing verbal intelligence, in contrast with traditional assessment methods based on standardized norms.
Methods
We used a within-participants design, comparing scores obtained from AI-BVCTs with those from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) verbal comprehension index (VCI). In total, 8 Hebrew-speaking participants completed both the VCI and AI-BVCT, the latter being generated using the LLM Claude.
Results
The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) demonstrated strong agreement between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (Claude: CCC=.75, 90% CI 0.266-0.933; GPT-4: CCC=.73, 90% CI 0.170-0.935). Pearson correlations further supported these findings, showing strong associations between VCI and AI-BVCT scores (Claude: r=.84, P<.001; GPT-4: r=.77, P=.02). No statistically significant differences were found between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (P>.05).
Conclusions
These findings support the potential of LLMs to assess verbal intelligence. The study attests to the promise of AI-based cognitive tests in increasing the accessibility and affordability of assessment processes, enabling personalized testing. The research also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy and overreliance on AI in clinical work. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to establish the validity and reliability of this approach and develop more accurate scoring procedures.}

abstract = {Conventional methods for restoring unknown regions in images often face challenges arising from ambiguous semantics and unrealistic structural reconstructions. These issues primarily stem from the rigid frameworks that struggle to extract reliable semantic information from corrupted inputs. To overcome these limitations and improve model adaptability, we propose a flexible model that leverages dynamic feature aggregation and mask-aware guidance. Our approach introduces an integrated architecture that synergizes Transformers and CNNs, endowed with dynamic learning mechanisms through image and feature-level predictive filtering. This innovative architecture is further enhanced by a mask-guided, dual-way dynamic convolution designed to address discordant decoding issues. The effectiveness of these novel components is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on various benchmark datasets, consistently achieving superior performance in reconstructing coherent and plausible structures, particularly in cases of severe corruption.}

abstract = {As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of >4 orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of ≃50. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.}

Examples of approaches to classifying research have been applied to surgical simulation educational research. The article outlines these classifications and offers simulation examples. The surgical simulation community have published research priorities with most articles reflecting strong positivist notions of research. We believe this is a limited view and argue for research that seeks to deepen understanding of how simulation supports learning and can prepare trainees for the complexity of surgical practice. We acknowledge the role of professional communities in advancing simulation research and look to a future of interdisciplinary research. We propose emphasis on synthesizing the current body of knowledge, consulting with real patients for educational focus, fostering interprofessional simulation, clarifying terms used in simulation practice and ensuring high-quality simulation practice aligned with published frameworks.}

Specifically, the review addresses two questions: First, what are the constitutive features and actions that characterize creative learning? Second, what are the overarching themes that can be identified in the literature? The study reports on the findings of an extensive thematic analysis, which indicated four general approaches to creative learning: namely (1) creative agency over learning, (2) affective and embodied pathways, (3) relational ecologies, and (4) learning by doing and making. The review concludes with a discussion of each of these themes, deriving from them a set of practical recommendations and a revised definition of creative learning.}

This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking.}

abstract = {Introduction
Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a rare condition in athletes and musicians who perform repeated prolonged forced gripping movements. It mainly affects young men, and presents with cramp-like pain, beginning on the anteromedial side of the forearm and progressively extending to the entire circumference, and may be associated with muscle weakness and neurologic symptoms. The objective of this study was to report preliminary results of ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome.
Material and methods
A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted. Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome was diagnosed on clinical presentation and pathological intramuscular pressure measurement, defined as >30 mmHg at 1 min after effort. The series comprised 7 men, with bilateral involvement. Mean age was 30 years. All patients were motorcyclists. The mean preoperative intramuscular pressure at 1 min after effort was 60.75 mmHg (range: 30−81 mmHg). The main study endpoint was change in pain on visual analogic scale. Secondary endpoints comprised patient satisfaction, change in competitive sports level, and time to return to sport. Complications were noted.
Results
Six patients (12 forearms) were evaluated. Mean follow-up was 22.5 months (range: 3–48 months). Mean pain rating was 7.3/10 (range: 6–9) preoperatively, and 0/10 postoperatively. All patients were satisfied with the procedure. Mean time to return to sports was 25.5 days (range: 21–30 days). No patients decreased their competitive sports level after the procedure. One patient presented a postoperative hematoma, not requiring surgery.
Conclusion
Ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is an innovative technique with promising preliminary results.

We also calculate the expected number of keystrokes until a target string would first be produced. Given the expected time until the heat death of the universe, we demonstrate that the widely-accepted conclusion from the Infinite Monkeys Theorem is, in fact, misleading in our finite universe. As such, this places the theorem in a class of probabilistic problems or paradoxes, including the St. Petersburg paradox, Zeno's dichotomy paradox and the Ross–Littlewood paradox wherein the infinite-resource conclusions directly contradict those obtained when considering limited resources, however sizeable.}

Also, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown to be an interesting source of new ideas but has not been used for designing children’s meals. The aims of the work were to evaluate the potential of school meals either co-designed by children or generated with AI, and to explore parents’ perception towards the utilization of whole food in their children’s meal. Children, with the potential support of their parents, proposed recipes with whole fruit/vegetable utilization, and a selection among the suggestions was conducted by nutritionists and the school cooks. The selected meal was compared to a similar recipe from ChatGPT generated from a simple prompt with regard to their acceptance and emotions evoked. The two dishes were variations of carrot pie recipes including vegetable peel and were both prepared by experienced school cooks. A third recipe proposed by the school’s cooks was used as comparison. Parents’ perceptions towards whole food utilization to their children were elicited by sentence completion methodology. Results showed that children liked both their and the cooks’ recipes but rejected ChatGPT’s recipe. Both cooks’ and children’s carrot pies evoked positive emoji pairs, meanwhile ChatGPT’s carrot pie was associated to emojis of negative connotation. Texture and unfamiliar taste were cited to justify the rejection. For parents, the utilization of whole fruits/vegetable in children’s meals is perceived as a good and nutritious idea, but safety concerns were revealed. This work demonstrates co-design with school children and whole food utilization as actionable strategies towards reducing waste of nutritious resources. Moreover, the study reports an unsuccessful exploratory usage of ChatGPT through a task-focused prompt. This may suggest the importance of specifying the context of the task when prompting an AI, to compensate for contextual information that is implicitly available to humans. Concerns about safety aspects should be addressed to ensure parents’ support for whole vegetable utilization in school meals.}

Substance use trends are complex; they often rapidly evolve and necessitate an intersectional approach in research, service, and policy making. Current and emerging digital tools related to substance use are promising but also create a range of challenges and opportunities.
Objective
This paper reports on a backcasting exercise aimed at the development of a roadmap that identifies values, challenges, facilitators, and milestones to achieve optimal use of digital tools in the substance use field by 2030.
Methods
A backcasting exercise method was adopted, wherein the core elements are identifying key values, challenges, facilitators, milestones, cornerstones and a current, desired, and future scenario. A structured approach was used by means of (1) an Open Science Framework page as a web-based collaborative working space and (2) key stakeholders’ collaborative engagement during the 2022 Lisbon Addiction Conference.
Results
The identified key values were digital rights, evidence-based tools, user-friendliness, accessibility and availability, and person-centeredness. The key challenges identified were ethical funding, regulations, commercialization, best practice models, digital literacy, and access or reach. The key facilitators identified were scientific research, interoperable infrastructure and a culture of innovation, expertise, ethical funding, user-friendly designs, and digital rights and regulations. A range of milestones were identified. The overarching identified cornerstones consisted of creating ethical frameworks, increasing access to digital tools, and continuous trend analysis.
Conclusions
The use of digital tools in the field of substance use is linked to a range of risks and opportunities that need to be managed. The current trajectories of the use of such tools are heavily influenced by large multinational for-profit companies with relatively little involvement of key stakeholders such as people who use drugs, service providers, and researchers. The current funding models are problematic and lack the necessary flexibility associated with best practice business approaches such as lean and agile principles to design and execute customer discovery methods. Accessibility and availability, digital rights, user-friendly design, and person-focused approaches should be at the forefront in the further development of digital tools. Global legislative and technical infrastructures by means of a global action plan and strategy are necessary and should include ethical frameworks, accessibility of digital tools for substance use, and continuous trend analysis as cornerstones.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) personas for training library staff in an online chat reference environment, enhancing trainees’ abilities to respond effectively to real-life patron requests.
Design/methodology/approach
The project used ChatGPT-4 to construct custom generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) that acted as library patrons and presented the types of questions and reference requests that library staff would likely receive. These AI personas were improved iteratively and collaboratively. Novice chat reference users were surveyed on their experiences with the final AI personas.
Findings
The use of AI personas for training library staff showed promising results. AI personas could simulate interactions with actual patrons, and trainees’ confidence levels increased due to their use. However, limitations still exist, as AI personas were prone to providing overly detailed answers or required prompting to stay on task.
Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to apply AI personas in the context of improving training for online chat reference. The experience contrasts with other efforts to use generative AI to provide answers directly to patrons without human intervention or involvement.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has expanded across various fields, including medical education and professional applications. However, the extent to which AI is utilized in writing personal statements (PSs) for adult reconstruction fellowship applications remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of AI-generated text in PSs submitted to our institution before and after the release of ChatGPT.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed PSs submitted to our institution’s adult reconstruction fellowship from 2021 to 2025. The PSs were divided into two cohorts: Pre-PS (2021 to 2022) and Post-PS (2024 to 2025). The PSs from 2023 were excluded due to uncertainty in AI adoption. All PSs were analyzed using GPTZero, an AI detection software, to determine the proportion of AI-generated versus human-generated text. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses were conducted.
Results
A total of 421 PSs were analyzed. The Pre-PS cohort had an average GPTZero score of 99.5% (SD 1.9) human, 0.4% (SD 0.8) AI, and 0.1% (SD 1.8) mixed, while the Post-PS cohort had scores of 83.8% (SD 29.9) human, 15.1% (SD 28.9) AI, and 1.1% mixed (SD 5.2) (P < 0.001). The AI-generated text was significantly more prevalent in the Post-PS cohort compared to the Pre-PS cohort. Additionally, international medical graduates (IMGs) and applicants from non-U.S. residencies demonstrated a higher proportion of AI-generated text in their PSs compared to U.S. applicants (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The use of AI in PS writing has increased significantly since the release of ChatGPT. Given the role of PSs in candidate selection, these findings highlight the need for transparency, standardized guidelines regarding AI-assisted writing, and re-evaluation of the importance placed on personal statements in candidate selection. Further research should expand to other subspecialties and institutions to assess the broader implications of AI in postgraduate medical education.}

As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth—namely that highly hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and cell envelope morphology (hops are not equally effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre- and post-assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.}

abstract = {Considering the influence of external time-varying disturbances on trajectory tracking control of nonlinear systems, a novel prescribed-time nonsingular sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed. Firstly, based on the definition of prescribed time stability, a lemma of practical prescribed time stability is proposed, which guarantees the system states converge to a region within the prescribed time. Secondly, a prescribed time SMC method is designed, which does not contain negative power terms in the controller and solves the singular problem. In addition, a continuous function is adopted instead of the sign function to reduce chattering, and it is also considered in the stability proof. The stability analysis shows that whatever it is in the sliding stage or the reaching stage, the tracking error is prescribed time stable. On the basis of prescribed time SMC method, the neural network (NN) is introduced to approximate the unknown model information. Finally, compared with other existing control methods, the results of simulation demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance, encompassing the achievement of prescribed time stability, the elimination of chattering, and the capability to analyze unknown model information via neural networks.}

abstract = {Generative AI technologies are rapidly advancing and are increasingly deployed by firms for marketing purposes. However, research on generative AI in the marketing domain remains limited, particularly regarding the balance of human-AI collaboration in generative AI video advertisements. This study explores and distinguishes between two types of generative AI video ads based on the balance of human-AI collaboration: (1) those featuring human-AI collaborative characters and (2) those comprising solely AI-generated characters. Using the elaboration likelihood model as a lens, this study proposes a conceptual framework with two parallel mediators: one at the cognitive level (perceived creativity) and the other at the emotional level (AI anxiety). A multi-method study was conducted, employing diverse data sources and analytical techniques. In Study 1, we analyze a real-world dataset of generative AI video advertisements on YouTube to identify the distinct types and examine audience reactions. In Study 2, an experimental design is used to causally evaluate the effects of these advertisements on the audience. The results indicate that generative AI advertisements featuring real human-AI character collaborations generate more favorable audience attitudes, as they are perceived to be more creative and evoke lower levels of AI-induced anxiety compared to advertisements composed entirely of AI-generated characters. The study underscores the critical role of humans as gatekeepers of humanity.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to assess whether information from AI chatbots on benefits and harms of breast and prostate cancer screening were concordant with evidence-based cancer screening recommendations.
Methods
Seven unique prompts (four breast cancer; three prostate cancer) were presented to ChatGPT in March 2024. A total of 60 criteria (30 breast; 30 prostate) were used to assess the concordance of information. Concordance was scored between 0 and 2 against the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast and prostate cancer screening recommendations independently by international cancer screening experts.
Results
43 of 60 (71.7 %) criteria were completely concordant, 3 (5 %) were moderately concordant and 14 (23.3 %) were not concordant or not present, with most of the non-concordant criteria (9 of 14, 64.3 %) being from prompts for the oldest age groups. ChatGPT hallucinations (i.e., completely made up, non-sensical or irrelevant information) were found in 9 of 60 criteria (15 %).
Conclusions
ChatGPT provided information mostly concordant with USPSTF breast and prostate cancer screening recommendations, however, important gaps exist. These findings provide insights into the role of AI to communicate cancer screening benefits and harms and hold increased relevance for periods of guideline change.
Practice implications
AI generated information on cancer screening should be taken in conjunction with official screening recommendations and/or information from clinicians.}
