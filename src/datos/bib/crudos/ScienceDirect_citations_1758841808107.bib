abstract = {Industry 5.0 strives to enhance manufacturing by prioritizing the human role, aiming that workers excel in productivity within safe and intuitive work environments. To address this need, Human Digital Twins (HDT) have gained notoriety in which human-related data is collected to feed other methodologies such as Lean manufacturing or cognitive deloading approaches. Together with concerns regarding data privacy and regulatory compliance, this imposes a formidable challenge. This work introduces a foundational HDT component designed to facilitate the human digital twinning process. With only a single camera and heavily relying on edge computing, this system uses deep learning image processing algorithms deployed on a Google Coral Dev Board, ensuring user anonymity and privacy while delivering near real-time performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of this cost-efficient solution, experiments were conducted in an industrial laboratory setting to assess its functionality as a navigation support system for warehouse picking. To the authors’ knowledge, no prior studies have utilized a single-camera depth-perception setup for human pose estimation in this context. The system achieved strong performance, estimating the third dimension of human pose keypoints with an absolute error below 0.11 meters and classifying tasks with 94% accuracy across diverse picking sequences and subjects.}

This study constructed a carbon-tracking framework integrating energy allocation analysis with the logarithmic mean Divisia index (EAA-LMDI). Using energy input-output tables, the authors derived the primary energy consumption responsibility conversion factor (KPECR), fossil fuel component factor (Kfossil), and primary CO2 emission factor (KC), and visualized carbon flows with Sankey diagrams. The approach captured hidden conversion losses across extraction, conversion, and end-use, and decomposed influencing factors of CO2 emissions for 27 economic and residential sectors during 2005–2020. Total CO2 responsibility increased from 5534 Mt in 2005 to 10,177 Mt in 2020, with 88 %–92 % from the economic sector. GDP per capita was the main driver (7788 Mt), while lower energy intensity (−2731 Mt) and declining Kfossil (−501 Mt) helped restrain growth. Between 2015 and 2020, the rebound of energy-intensive industries and rapid electrification offset the emissions reductions from economic restructuring. Although electrification is clean at the end-use stage, it increases upstream emissions, as over 60 % of electricity still comes from coal. Improved coal-fired unit efficiency reduced the electricity's KPECR, avoiding 88 Mt of emissions. Policy priorities include: (1) flexibility retrofits of coal-fired power plants with industrial waste-heat recovery; (2) tighter controls to avert cyclical overcapacity in heavy industry; and (3) cross-sector digital platforms for energy-carbon coordination. The EAA-LMDI framework links sectoral behaviour and technical change, providing a robust analytical tool for multi-stage decarbonization pathways in coal-dependent economies.}

The arrival of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, offers EFL teachers an opportunity to regularly collaborate with AI chatbots to create new source materials. The writing experiments in this study considered how to effectively and ethically work with generative AI to produce culturally appropriate EFL teaching materials. The experiments involved co-producing moral dilemmatic stories with ChatGPT to support a new Chinese EFL curriculum unit on “Morals and Virtues”. We draw on Lo's (2023a, 2023b) CLEAR framework for prompt engineering to generate appropriate stimulus materials. We refer to Durkheim's (1961) sociological theory on morality and Bernstein's (1971, 1981, 2003) concept of framing to unpack how moral decisions might be framed as dilemmas in particular sociocultural contexts. We then mobilize Martin and White's (2005) appraisal framework to uncover the patterns of cultural biases embedded in the AI-generated text. We propose a two-step “Navigation and Generation” method for effective prompt engineering with generative AI: first navigating the AI chatbot to a clear and consistent positioning around a concept, and then requesting the AI chatbot to generate text based on the clarifications generated in the first step. Our appraisal analysis indicates that WEIRD (western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) cultural values are embedded in moral dilemmatic stories generated by ChatGPT. EFL Teachers need to be aware of how these values are presented to encourage critical cultural awareness in their students.}

Thirty-seven participants from three faculties participated in 14 individual interviews and seven focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis protocols. Encountered challenges were grouped into epistemological, ontological, and practical dimensions. Findings indicate that students drew upon various sources for inquiry and monitoring at the stages of planning and preparation, revising before submission, and reacting after getting results. Implications include the importance of creating low-threshold opportunities for facilitating learners’ feedback seeking.

abstract = {Background
Approximately 39% of young people (aged 16-24 y) experience mental ill health, but only 23% seek professional help. Early intervention is essential for reducing the impacts of mental illness, but young people, particularly those from culturally diverse communities, report experiencing shame and stigma, which can deter them from engaging with face-to-face services. Digital mental health (DMH) tools promise to increase access, but there is a lack of literature exploring the suitability of DMH tools for culturally diverse populations.
Objective
The project was conducted in partnership with a large-scale national DMH organization that promotes evidence-based early intervention, treatment, and support of mental health in young people and their families. The organization wanted to develop a self-directed web-based platform for parents and young people that integrates psychological assessments and intervention pathways via a web-based “check-in” tool. Our project explored the views of culturally diverse parents and young people on the opportunities and barriers to engagement with a web-based DMH screening tool.
Methods
We conducted a 2-phase qualitative study aiming to identify potential issues faced by culturally diverse communities when engaging with DMH tools designed for the Australian public. We worked with 18 culturally diverse participants (parents: n=8, 44%; young people: n=10, 56%) in a series of design-led workshops drawing on methods from speculative design and user experience to understand the opportunities and barriers that organizations might face when implementing population-level DMH tools with culturally diverse communities. NVivo was used to conduct thematic analyses of the audio-recorded and transcribed workshop data.
Results
Five themes were constructed from the workshops: (1) trust in the use and application of a DMH tool, (2) data management and sharing, (3) sociocultural influences on mental health, (4) generational differences in mental health and digital literacy, and (5) stigma and culturally based discrimination in mental health support.
Conclusions
The emergent themes have important considerations for researchers wishing to develop more inclusive DMH tools. The study found that healthy parent-child relationships will increase engagement in mental health support for young persons from culturally diverse backgrounds. Barriers to engagement with DMH tools included culturally based discrimination, the influence of culture on mental health support, and the potential impact of a diagnostic label on help seeking. The study’s findings suggest a need for culturally safe psychoeducation for culturally diverse end users that fosters self-determination with tailored resources. They also highlight important key challenges when working with culturally diverse populations.}

Moreover, their mediating capacities are often mythicized, to such an extent that one might surmise the direct transmission of the mental images from the designer's consciousness to an external representation. In this speculative essay, we demonstrate that the process of representation at work in architectural design originates from the designer's consciousness natural cognitive ability, rather than from the use of a specific mediation tool between the designer and his environment, between the mentally constructed architectural project and its representation. The effects of any tool of representation—analog or digital—on our perceptual apparatus depend primarily on the cognitive mechanisms affecting the discontinuous flow of internal representations formed by our consciousness. In other words, we propose to shed a new light on these limitations through the heuristic modeling of an architectural project designer confronted with his own cognitive biases, and the limits of the representation processes. In the present essay, the discontinuities and uncertainties inherent to the processes of representation are reintegrate in the models.}

However, ASAS systems on such basis have seen limited adoption in authentic teaching environments due to the models’ inability to explain the predictions they generate. To address this, we recruited 32 human graders to comparatively analyse the decision-making processes of human graders and AI-driven graders. Specifically, we exploited two types of data to holistically unveil the decision-making processes of human graders throughout grading, namely manual annotation of important words and gaze data of the human graders. The decision-making processes of AI-driven graders were revealed by important words extracted though eXplainable Artificial Intelligence technique and grading confidence reflected by the prediction probability distributions. We measured the alignment in their decision-making regarding their (i) estimated scoring difficulty, (ii) important text segments and (iii) crucial grammatical categories to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of AI-driven graders. Subsequently, we conducted randomised control studies, presenting machine-extracted insights like important words and estimated scoring difficulty to scrutinise how they affected human grading. Our findings contribute new knowledge regarding the consistency between human and machine scoring and validates machine-extracted insights, such as important words and scoring difficulty, to be valuable in facilitating human grading, encouraging the adoption of ASAS systems and urging the potential collaboration between machine and human grading in pedagogical practices. However, we emphasised the significance of grasping question context and intricacy before leveraging such machine-extracted insights.}

In Study 2, N = 101 participants performed the online GSS 1, the online working memory ability test of the Intelligence-Structure-Test 2000 R, and the online Conflict-Monitoring-Questionnaire (CMQ-28). Individual differences of working memory ability measured by means of GSS 1 story recall and the Intelligence-Structure-Test 2000 R emerged to be convergent constructs. Individual differences of working memory ability and suggestibility are diverging constructs correlating either negatively or non-significantly. Individual differences of suggestibility and CMQ-28 subscales are widely diverging constructs correlating mainly non-significantly despite sufficient a-priori calculated sample size. The present results on individual differences of working memory ability, suggestibility and CMQ-conflict monitoring contribute to the investigation of convergent and discriminant validity in a non-forensic domain with a low level of social pressure.

Using survey data from international buyers across 29 countries (regions) and secondary national distance indices, we find that the buyer's sales-rep commitment, like firm commitment, positively impacts both the seller's sales share performance and the buyer's special treatment benefits. Furthermore, we find that cross-border economic and cultural distances can weaken the positive effect of firm commitment, while cultural distance strengthens the positive effect of sales-rep commitment.

Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities. Notably, chemotherapeutic medications, immunotherapeutic agents, and photothermal therapies can now be delivered more precisely to the affected site using NP-based systems.

Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the β-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB. The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of β hairpin from α helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial β-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.}

Digitalized shopfloors can leverage an unprecedented availability of data for better and faster decision-making, resulting in enhanced operational performance. However, limited research has investigated the organizational and individual implications for those who run the manufacturing lines: production managers, supervisors, team leaders, and workers. By adopting a socio-technical framework, this study aims to disentangle the effects that digitalization has on shopfloors’ organizational structures, decision-making processes, and individual competencies, as well as the interdependencies among them. An exploratory approach was adopted, based on an empirical cross-country study involving 34 semi-structured interviews conducted in the Italian and Spanish automotive sectors. Analyzed through the lenses of information-processing, knowledge-based, and dynamic capability theories, our findings reveal through five propositions how digitalization induces a “polarization” of operational decision-making: shopfloors are run by knowledgeable data-empowered production managers and autonomous information-processing team leaders on the front line, with a reduced importance of supervisors. Upskilling needs appear for team leaders but not production workers, whose involvement, however, emerges as a key factor for a successful digitalization and overall performance in initial DT stages. This study contributes to literature on digitalization by exposing managerial tensions and dynamic capabilities, along with a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of DT in terms of implications for shop-floor decision-makers. Managerial implications are directed at creating awareness about the centrality of production team leaders, and future research avenues are proposed.}

This study develops a novel calculation model for sluice gate flow in both free and submerged conditions by examining the complete energy–momentum equations and taking into account factors such as section contraction, velocity uniformity, and energy loss. Numerical simulations were subsequently conducted to establish equations for the contraction coefficient, Coriolis, Boussinesq, and energy loss coefficient. Finally, a sluice gate flow experiment was conducted, and the results of this and previous experiments were used to compare the performance of the proposed model with that of simplified energy–momentum equation models as well as the Henry, Swamee, Simulation of Irrigation Canals, and Specification models. The results indicate that the smallest prediction error, measured at just 4.51 %, was demonstrated by the proposed model, which also exhibited the lowest sensitivity to the submergence degree. Therefore, this study advances the theoretical understanding of free and submerged flows and offers a valuable reference informing flow measurements during irrigation and flood discharge processes.}

We investigate whether confirmation bias (through prior audit opinions) occurs among auditors during the audit process and decision-making, and whether experience mitigates this effect. A total of 175 non-experienced auditors run a 2x4 between-subjects experiment (experiment 1) studying how financial information (IV with two levels: negative and neutral/positive) and previous audit report (IV with four levels: absence, negative, moderately negative, and positive) might influence the issuance of the subsequent decision-making (DV). In addition, a total of 32 junior level 1 auditors (less than one year of experience), 31 junior level 2 auditors (up to 3 years of experience) and 20 senior auditors (more than 3 years of experience) run a 2 × 4 × 3 between-subjects experiment (experiment 2) analyzing if experience (IV with three levels of experience: less than one-year, between one and three years, more than three years) mitigates this effect (experiment 2). Results confirm that the previous-year audit report affect auditors' current assessment, showing that positive and negative prior opinions persuade auditors when suggesting the next one. This finding is relevant as auditors' opinions could be conditioned by prior opinions instead of their own expertise. Our evidence also suggests that professional experience mitigates this influence on auditors' assessments. Consequently, this study has relevant implications for partners, audit professionals and audit firm recruiters. A general implication is that auditor training courses should reinforce the auditor's own expertise and criteria based on the deep analysis of financial and economic data rather than on the work of previous auditors.}

It is a hybrid or mixed review as it uses both quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. The aims of this study are a performance analysis of the selected documents (years of publication, country, sectors, techniques used, most cited authors, authors with more publications, journals, journal quartiles, and scope of publication), as well as a co-word analysis using Atlas. ti v8. The results of the quantitative analysis indicate that the majority are empirical works. The qualitative analysis is a co-word analysis providing the following results: (i) classification of authors by major themes-categories (EI, leadership, team), (ii) classification of themes within each major theme: three subcategories in EI, 17 subcategories in leadership, and 19 subcategories in team and, lastly, (iii) classification according to the chronological development of main objectives from the most cited authors' articles we analyzed. Leadership (transformational, emergence, virtual, effective, health, effectiveness) is the major theme we studied. Our in-depth review of the articles has shown that emotionally intelligent leaders improve both behaviors and business results and have an impact on work team performance. It also highlighted a positive relationship between emotional competence and team members’ attitudes about work. The new trends focus on the impacts of COVID19, the global crisis due to the Ukraine War, working in VUCA and BANI environments, comparative studies between generations, the application of artificial intelligence and the influence of mindfulness on organizations.}

In fact, it is both being incorporated into specific curricula, allowing students the possibility to acquire skills within this field, and more recently AI has been used as a tool to facilitate the teaching and learning process. However, an increased demand and availability of these tools do not imply a successful switch from traditional to AI-supported learning. In this work, ChatGMP, a chatbot leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) able to conduct an interview exercise in a Master's Degree course taught at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is introduced. The exercise consists in a student interview of a fictitious company, represented by the teachers or ChatGMP, regarding its Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). The aim is for the students to ask sensible and well-reasoned questions to acquire the necessary documentation to make an exhaustive report indicating whether the company is a potential fit for business. To evaluate the initiative, we compare the performance of ChatGMP to the one of the physical teachers of the course, as well as the perception of the students towards it. The results show no significant difference in the information provided by the teachers and the model, enabling the students to achieve similar learning. The students that interacted with ChatGMP are satisfied with the initiative and would likely recommend future students to perform the audit with the digital tool. This initial experiment and its positive results lay the foundation for opening the discussion on how to use LLMs in education, the opportunities they could provide, as well as their limitations and drawbacks.}

abstract = {Hypoxia, a defining feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), significantly contributes to cancer progression by influencing immune regulation, promoting angiogenesis, altering metabolic pathways, and driving uncontrolled cell proliferation. This review explores the diverse functions of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling in cancer development and progression, providing a comprehensive overview of the molecular pathways. HIFs, particularly HIF-1α and HIF-2α, regulate several genes related to cancer hallmarks such as invasion, metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance, thus mediating a significant portion of the hypoxic response. Hydroxylation of proline and asparagine residues in HIF-α subunits, which occurs in an oxygen-dependent manner, serves as a key regulatory mechanism for both their stability and transcriptional function. Notably, this complex interaction is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/ protein kinase B/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR), and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways. In cancer, HIF signaling affects several aspects of tumor cell biology that contribute to the cancerous characteristic, including angiogenesis induction through the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, metabolic reprogramming through the enhancement of the Warburg effect, facilitation of cancer invasion and metastasis by driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and matrix remodeling patterns, and mediation of therapeutic resistance partly due to the effects on drug efflux pumps and DNA damage repair. Several types of direct and indirect inhibitors, including small molecule inhibitors, peptidomimetics, antibodies, and PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras, are being investigated for therapeutic potential. Preclinical and early clinical trials have demonstrated significant synergistic effects in inhibiting tumor development when HIF inhibition is combined with traditional therapies (chemotherapy or radiation) or immunotherapies, emphasizing major clinical implications and the potential for improving patient outcomes. Although challenges exist, particularly regarding drug resistance, further research to improve therapeutic efficacy and prolong survival for patients is warranted.}

The findings indicated that TTF indirectly improved GenAI-enabled learning productivity through its positive effects on challenge appraisal and positive emotion. Although hindrance appraisal and negative emotion showed limited direct effects, their partial indirect roles were observed. Multi-group analysis further revealed the moderating effects of school district, teaching stage, gender and teaching experience, highlighting the importance of personalized support in GenAI-enhanced professional development. This study contributes to understanding the psychological mechanisms behind technology-integrated learning and provides guidance for designing personalized, emotionally supportive development programs for STEM teachers.}

abstract = {Trinucleotide repeat expansions fold into long, stable hairpins and cause a variety of incurable RNA gain-of-function diseases such as Huntington’s disease, the myotonic dystrophies, and spinocerebellar ataxias. One approach for treating these diseases is to bind small molecules to these structured RNAs. Both Huntington’s disease-like 2 (HDL2) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) are caused by a r(CUG) repeat expansion, or r(CUG)exp. The RNA folds into a hairpin structure with a periodic array of 1 × 1 nucleotide UU loops (5′CUG/3′GUC; where the underlined nucleotides indicate the Us in the internal loop) that sequester various RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and hence the source of its gain-of-function. Here, we report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-refined structures of single 5′CUG/3′GUC motifs in complex with three different small molecules, a di-guandinobenzoate (1), a derivative of 1 where the guanidino groups have been exchanged for imidazole (2), and a quinoline with improved drug-like properties (3). These structures were determined using NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing with restrained molecular dynamics (MD). Compounds 1, 2, and 3 formed stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5′CUG/3′GUC motif. Compound 3 also formed van der Waals interactions with the internal loop. The global structure of each RNA-small molecule complexes retains an A-form conformation, while the internal loops are still dynamic but to a lesser extent compared to the unbound form. These results aid our understanding of ligand-RNA interactions and enable structure-based design of small molecules with improved binding affinity for and biological activity against r(CUG)exp. As the first ever reported structures of a r(CUG) repeat bound to ligands, these structures can enable virtual screening campaigns combined with machine learning assisted de novo design.}

This study examines the theoretical mechanisms and boundary conditions that determine how AI empathy influences users’ approach-avoidance intentions. Drawing on the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm and the uncanny valley effect (UVE), we propose a moderated dual mediation model. This model is empirically tested using two experimental studies. The results reveal distinct pathways by which cognitive and affective empathy affect approach-avoidance intentions. Specifically, cognitive empathy primarily influences approach-avoidance intentions via perceived novelty, whereas affective empathy exerts its effect through perceived warmth. Additionally, perceived warmth and eeriness together mediate the impact of affective empathy on approach-avoidance intentions. Notably, mindful AI agents strengthen the effect of affective empathy on the UVE but diminish the influence of cognitive empathy on approach-avoidance intentions, relative to mindless agents. These findings provide important insights for AI designers and companies seeking to develop empathetic, user-centered conversational agents for mental health applications.}

abstract = {Background
Over the past 4 decades, obesity has escalated into a global epidemic, with its worldwide prevalence nearly tripling. Pharmacological treatments have evolved with the recent development of glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, such as semaglutide. However, off-label use of drugs such as Ozempic for cosmetic weight loss has surged in popularity, raising concerns about potential misuse and the emergence of substandard and falsified products in the unregulated supply chain.
Objective
This study aims to conduct a multifactor investigation of product quality and patient safety risks associated with the unregulated online sale of semaglutide by examining product availability and vendor characteristics and assessing product quality through test purchases.
Methods
We used a complex risk and quality assessment methodology combining online market surveillance, search engine results page analysis, website content assessment, domain traffic analytics, conducting targeted product test purchases, visual quality inspection of product packaging, microbiological sterility and endotoxin contamination evaluation, and quantitative sample analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
Results
We collected and evaluated 1080 links from search engine results pages and identified 317 (29.35%) links belonging to online pharmacies, of which 183 (57.7%) led to legal pharmacies and 134 (42.3%) directed users to 59 unique illegal online pharmacy websites. Web traffic data for the period between July and September 2023 revealed that the top 30 domains directly or indirectly affiliated with illegal online pharmacies accumulated over 4.7 million visits. Test purchases were completed from 6 illegal online pharmacies with the highest number of links offering semaglutide products for sale without prescription at the lowest price range. Three injection vial purchases were delivered; none of the 3 Ozempic prefilled injection pens were received due to nondelivery e-commerce scams. All purchased vials were considered probable substandard and falsified products, as visual inspection indicated noncompliance in more than half (59%-63%) of the evaluated criteria. The semaglutide content of samples substantially exceeded labeled amounts by 28.56%-38.69%, although no peptide-like impurities were identified. The lyophilized peptide samples were devoid of viable microorganisms at the time of testing; however, endotoxin was detected in all samples with levels ranging between 2.1645 EU/mg and 8.9511 EU/mg. Furthermore, the measured semaglutide purity was significantly low, ranging between 7.7% and 14.37% and deviating from the 99% claimed on product labels by manufacturers.
Conclusions
Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist drugs promoted for weight loss, similar to erectile dysfunction medications more than 2 decades ago, are becoming the new blockbuster lifestyle medications for the illegal online pharmacy market. Protecting the pharmaceutical supply chain from substandard and falsified weight loss products and raising awareness regarding online medication safety must be a public health priority for regulators and technology platforms alike.}

The observed violet-blue emission and improved dielectric behavior endorse the potential applications of Zn1-xPbxAl2O4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2 mol %) ceramic powder in UV sensors.}

Furthermore, it proposes a novel unsupervised topic labeling procedure to address the limitations in current topic modeling interpretations, which are often not fully unsupervised. The procedure comprised automatic generation of labels that directly support opportunity modeling and facilitate product design development. To achieve the stated objectives, data was collected from user comments on YouTube car reviews and analyzed using various algorithms and part-of-speech rules, finding that Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with noun-adjective combinations proved most effective in generating comprehensible topic labels and capturing emotional expressions. The results revealed six underserved labels, one served right, and two overserved categories for new vehicle design improvements, providing valuable insights into user experiences. The insights provided in this context are expected to contribute to the potential improvement of vehicle attribute designs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the entire design process.}

We focus on the junctions between Σ3 {112} grain-boundary facets (often termed "incoherent" or "lateral" twin boundaries) in face-centered-cubic metals. Planar Σ3 {112} boundaries have long been modeled as dense arrays of Shockley partial dislocations distributed on adjacent {111} planes. Here, we analyze how such dislocations must be arranged at grain-boundary facet junctions. We find that these junctions constrain the sequences of dislocations that can allow for motion of the junctions through coordinated, conservative glide, a result we investigate with complementary molecular-dynamics simulations. For some facet arrangements, namely those for which facets are terminated at both ends by junctions of the same sense, the Shockley partial dislocations must change planes at the junctions, forming a2〈110〉 unit jogs. Because the unit jogs require the absorption or emission of point defects to move, they will limit motion of facet junctions. Such considerations offer insights into the mechanisms governing grain-boundary junction behavior.}

While much of the current research on GenAI in academia focuses on technical capabilities or ethical concerns, few studies have examined how GenAI can be leveraged to promote equity and inclusivity, particularly in academic communication. In this study, we adopt the theoretical lens of Ubuntu, a Southern African philosophy that emphasises interconnectedness and community, to reconceptualise GenAI as a democratising force. Five international PhD students in Education and their PhD supervisor (all multilingual users of English) explored their experiences of using GenAI. We used a collaborative autoethnographic approach, incorporating reflective prompting, individual writing, group sharing and refining, and group-based writing. We demonstrate that GenAI reshaped power dynamics and challenged academic hierarchies by providing real-time language support and improving academic writing clarity. This empowered us to participate in academic discourse, disrupting traditional gatekeeping mechanisms. By automating routine tasks, GenAI also shifted our academic focus from technical skills to intellectual contributions, fostering inclusivity and equity. This study highlights the potential of GenAI in terms of knowledge creation and academic discourse, particularly for doctoral scholars navigating linguistic and cultural barriers. Academia is predominantly Anglophone-centric, marginalising non-English-speaking scholars by imposing additional barriers to participation and recognition, perpetuating inequities in knowledge creation and dissemination. We argue that embracing GenAI can help to decolonise these academic practices, thereby promoting epistemic justice and creating a more equitable scholarly environment for all.}

However, delegating decisions to AI is challenging, especially in contexts that go beyond classical optimization problems. Current research has so far largely neglected to include the viewpoints of the decision-affected and of surrogate decision-makers in the discussion. To address these gaps, in this study we rely on two experimental designs and complement our findings with qualitative interview data to shed light on both sides: the perspective of those affected by the decision and that of the decision maker in surrogate and ethically complex decision contexts. Findings reveal that the individual decision-making perspective may lead to opposing perceptions. Whereas the willingness to delegate an ethically challenging decision to AI in a surrogate decision context is lower than that in a non-surrogate context (decision-maker perspective), people affected by the decision do not generally prefer humans to AI (decision-affected perspective). By these findings, we contribute to the literature on AI-enabled decision-making and decision delegation to non-human entities.}

In addition, some dedicated mobile apps can capture driving and diagnostic data from a vehicle via a Bluetooth-enabled OBD-II scanner. In this paper, we propose a new process for effective automotive forensics. It collects and analyzes three different types of data left on an Android phone which has been connected to the OBD-II port of a vehicle via Bluetooth communication. The three types of data are OBD-II Android apps' data, Bluetooth HCI snoop log, and the main log buffer of the Android logging system. By analyzing them individually and integratedly, we find Bluetooth connection time, vehicle information, MAC address of the OBD-II scanner, vehicle velocity, sharp speeding event, sudden braking event, refueling event, and so on. We also construct a timeline of Bluetooth traffic and driving events through the timeline analysis, which can be used to determine the driver's behaviors in terms of vehicle forensics.}

Based on the practice-based view framework and the characteristics of Chinese semiconductor industry, we investigate how DT affects GTI. Utilizing data from 191 Chinese semiconductor firms during 2014–2022, we draw empirical evidence that DT has positive effects on GTI and the positive effects are more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises than in state-owned enterprises.

To this end, process mining techniques use event data, typically extracted from information systems and organized along process instances. The inherent complexity of real-world processes has driven the recent introduction of object-centric process mining, allowing for a more comprehensive view of processes. Another avenue of research contributing to more complete process analyses is integrating unstructured data, which can enhance traditional event logs by extracting hitherto unidentified process information. Although combining the object-centric perspective with event log enrichment from unstructured data sources holds promising potential, such investigation remains in its infancy. Against this background, this study presents the OCRAUD, a reference architecture that provides guidance on using unstructured data sources and traditional event logs for object-centric process mining. A design science research process was employed to design and evaluate the OCRAUD. This involved conducting a total of 20 expert interviews over two rounds, comparing the OCRAUD to competing artifacts, instantiating the artifact for the use of video and sensor data, developing a software prototype, and applying the prototype to real-world data. This work contributes to process mining by guiding the combination of unstructured data with traditional event logs, incorporating an object-centric representation of event data. The instantiation targets video and sensor data, thereby demonstrating the use of the artifact. This enables researchers and practitioners to instantiate the artifact for other data types or specific use cases. The published code of the software prototype allows for further development of the implemented algorithms.}

While they are helping to achieve energy efficiency and operational reliability, there remain gaps in their fault diagnostic capabilities. The diagnostic results often contain multiple distinct candidate root causes (CRCs) or offer no insight into CRCs. This study developed a novel active rule-based multi-mode data analysis method to enhance diagnostic resolution by applying proven rule sets and additional new rules to data from multiple known operational modes. The proposed method was demonstrated using enhanced air handling unit performance assessment rule sets and validated with the simulated data of two air handling units. New metrics, namely, reduced number of CRCs and improvement ratio, were developed to quantify the improvement of fault diagnostic resolution. The validation results showed that the proposed method effectively reduced the number of CRCs in contrast to analyzing data solely for a single mode of operation. It achieved a median improvement ratio of 80% in 19 test cases.}

Articles 3 and 4 of European Union Directive 2019/790 and sections 243 and 244 of Singapore’s Copyright Act of 2021 are examples. Both exceptions are subject to the condition of ‘lawful access’. The interpretation of this concept, which is vague and undefined by law, is crucial to these exceptions, as it may, ultimately, deprive them of all usefulness. This paper seeks to unpack the meaning of lawful access and its inverse by drawing on other uses of the concept, namely in cybercrime law, and its underlying values. This analysis points towards an understanding of unlawful access as the circumvention of technological restrictions to access, such as paywalls.

abstract = {Objective:
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which integrate multiple data modalities beyond text. Although MLLMs show promise, there is a gap in the literature that empirically demonstrates their impact in healthcare. This paper summarizes the applications of MLLMs in healthcare, highlighting their potential to transform health practices.
Methods:
A rapid literature review was conducted in August 2024 using World Health Organization (WHO) rapid-review methodology and PRISMA standards, with searches across four databases (Scopus, Medline, PubMed and ACM Digital Library) and top-tier conferences—including NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, MICCAI, CVPR, ACL and EMNLP. Articles on MLLMs healthcare applications were included for analysis based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results:
The search yielded 115 articles, 39 included in the final analysis. Of these, 77% appeared online (preprints and published) in 2024, reflecting the emergence of MLLMs. 80% of studies were from Asia and North America (mainly China and US), with Europe lagging. Studies split evenly between pre-built MLLMs evaluations (60% focused on GPT versions) and custom MLLMs/frameworks development with task-specific customizations. About 81% of studies examined MLLMs for diagnosis and reporting in radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology, with additional applications in education, surgery, and mental health. Prompting strategies, used in 80% of studies, improved performance in nearly half. However, evaluation practices were inconsistent with 67% reported accuracy. Error analysis was mostly anecdotal, with only 18% categorized failure types. Only 13% validated explainability through clinician feedback. Clinical deployment was demonstrated in just 3% of studies, and workflow integration, governance, and safety were rarely addressed.
Discussion and Conclusion:
MLLMs offer substantial potential for healthcare transformation through multimodal data integration. Yet, methodological inconsistencies, limited validation, and underdeveloped deployment strategies highlight the need for standardized evaluation metrics, structured error analysis, and human-centered design to support safe, scalable, and trustworthy clinical adoption.}

Using the time-varying difference-in-differences model, this study explores the synergies of this program across 284 cities from 2009 to 2019. The findings are as follows: (1) With environmental information disclosed, the national air quality monitoring program can reduce the outdoor fine particulate matter concentration by an overall effect of 3.31%, equivalent to an almost 1% reduction calculated by its average value. (2) This program can enhance public environmental attention and stimulate environmental practitioners’ employment, thereby achieving a synergistic effect on air pollution reduction. (3) The pollution reduction effect is expected to be more pronounced in cities located in the southern and eastern regions, cities with higher population densities, and cities with favourable ventilation capabilities. (4) In response to air pollution problems, the public will adjust their daily consumption patterns to avoid potential health risks. As a result of the short-term behavioural changes, they will be more willing to pay for clean air by purchasing household air purifiers. This study highlights the considerable ecological and economic benefits of environmental information disclosure, thus further contributing to future eco-friendly and sustainable development.}

This research addresses these gaps through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative analysis using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for enrollment forecasting reveals nuanced dynamics in female enrollment, enhancing precision in predictions. Specifically, the ARIMA(0,1,1) model predicts the constant change of future values beyond the available data, while the prediction interval indicates enrollment fluctuations, gradually decreasing within the confidence intervals, and considering the simulated features. Qualitative document analysis provides contextual insights into socio-economic and policy-related factors, such as cultural attitudes, societal norms, educational policies, availability of female role models, level of support, and gender biases. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model comprehensively analyzes the impact of these (contextual) factors on the probability of female enrollment. Essentially, the prioritization of efforts should commence with addressing educational policies, promoting female role models, increasing support mechanisms, challenging cultural attitudes and societal norms, and addressing gender biases with nuanced strategies. Eventually, this study offers a cohesive understanding of female enrollment dynamics, providing a foundation for targeted interventions and policies to foster gender diversity in Tanzanian mathematics Master's programs.}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a real menace to industrial aquaculture due to the careless adoption of preventive therapies (antimicrobial therapeutic drugs) to forestall disease outbreaks in aquatic food production. Suitable strategies, or at least supplementary measures, should therefore be developed to curb the emergence and widespread transmission of AMR. Vaccination represents one of the primary options to substantially mitigate the economic damages imposed by emerging infectious diseases on global aquaculture; nevertheless, the availability of commercial aquatic vaccines is usually limited, and many vaccines only confer minimal or poor protection against infections (during the early stages of animal development). Accordingly, a large body of research has been enthusiastically exploring alternate approaches for managing animal health challenges. These efforts have led to the establishment of various biocontrol strategies, such as the versatile use of high-value functional ingredients (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, paraprobiotics, postbiotics, and phytogenics), phage therapy, and quorum-sensing interference (QSI), to promote the health and welfare of farmed aquatic species in a responsive or preventative manner. This review article addresses the state-of-the-art pertinent to biological control as an eco-friendly green approach for aquatic disease management, paving the route to a sustainable blue revolution. The potential biological mechanisms of these strategies are also described, along with the impediments to scientific progress and topics that merit further investigation.}

However, existing methods tend to overfit in data-scarce environments and lack generalizability across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a Topic Prompts Multimodal Network (TPMN), a novel framework that integrates topic-guided prompt learning with a Wide & Deep architecture for robust depression prediction. Specifically, topic prompts — contextual cues derived from underlying topic patterns in patient interviews — are constructed using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based prompt collection, capturing personalized semantic topics to guide multimodal feature alignment. These prompts help the model prioritize clinically relevant interactions across modalities via a cross-attention coupling function, where complex transformations dynamically align multimodal features, effectively mitigating overfitting while enhancing interpretability. Extensive experiments on AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 demonstrate TPMN’s superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 53% reduction in MAE (2.86 vs. SOTA 6.08) and 58% lower RMSE (3.36 vs. SOTA 7.96) on average. Notably, experiments on our self-collected Chinese dataset show that TPMN outperforms existing baseline methods, demonstrating its potential as a scalable diagnostic tool for diverse populations. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation across cultural datasets demonstrates TPMN’s strong generalizability, with results comparable to baseline methods. Beyond its technical contributions, this work bridges the gap between data-driven AI and clinical needs, offering a principled approach to personalized and culturally adaptive mental health assessment.}

However, forecasting economic time series with steep upward trends presents challenges, often leading to poorly fitting predictions.

Three real-world time series exhibiting this behavior were analyzed and forecasted using two neural network models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—with and without preprocessing. The differentiated series were further processed using techniques such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and trend-fluctuation decomposition via Moving Average of Wavelet Transform. The results demonstrate that differentiation significantly enhances forecasting accuracy across all tested models, reducing errors by up to 30 % compared to models without preprocessing. This approach effectively mitigates trend-related distortions, leading to more reliable predictions in complex economic time series.}

Ophthalmology has been particularly rapid in its adoption of AI development and glaucoma care is emerging as a pathway that may benefit from AI implementation, with a high disease burden and availability of large datasets. In order for AI to be implemented, there are a number of technical considerations that must be overcome, including the development and security of appropriate datasets. Furthermore, while recent years have highlighted the potential of AI to transform patient care, they have also exposed key risks associated with AI development, including accountability, fairness, and ethico-legal considerations.

abstract = {Background
Surgical lighting systems (SLSs) provide optimal lighting conditions for operating room personnel. Current systems are mainly adjusted by hand; surgeons either accommodate the light themselves or communicate their requirements to an assistant to ensure optimal surgical conditions. This poses challenges to maintaining sterility, proper accessibility, and illumination and can lead to potential collision problems. Furthermore, the personnel operating the light may not have deep medical knowledge or equipment expertise.
Objective
This paper introduces a touch-free interaction concept for controlling an SLS using speech and gestures.
Methods
We used an iterative, user-centered design approach with participatory design sessions. This process involved conducting a literature review, several observations of actual surgical sites, and engaging stakeholders through interviews and focus groups. In addition, we carried out 2 user studies: one in a virtual reality setup and another in a living laboratory environment.
Results
Our findings indicate that our interaction concept is a viable alternative for controlling an SLS. Despite some technical limitations, surgical experts found the system intuitive and useful, recognizing the significant potential for touch-free lighting adjustments in the operating room. The combination of speech and gesture modalities was seen as helpful and even necessary, with some interactions better suited to one modality over the other. Offering both modalities for each interaction provided greater flexibility.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that our proposed touch-free interaction concept can enhance surgical conditions and has the potential to replace traditional adjustment.}

Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers complementary insights into brain structure and function, thereby improving the diagnostic accuracy of neurological disorders and advancing brain-related research. However, the widespread applicability of MRI is substantially limited by restricted scanner accessibility and prolonged acquisition times. Here, we present TUMSyn, a text-guided universal MRI synthesis model capable of generating brain MRI specified by textual imaging metadata from routinely acquired scans. We ensure the reliability of TUMSyn by constructing a brain MRI database comprising 31,407 3D images across 7 MRI modalities from 13 worldwide centers and pre-training an MRI-specific text encoder to process text prompts effectively. Experiments on diverse datasets and physician assessments indicate that TUMSyn-generated images can be utilized along with acquired MRI scan(s) to facilitate large-scale MRI-based screening and diagnosis of multiple brain diseases, substantially reducing the time and cost of MRI in the healthcare system.}

In this systematic review, we review 69 existing experimental research studies on disability discrimination in hiring, published between June 1972 and January 2025, and outline key areas for future research in the field. Our review underlines significant differences in callback rates as well as variability in effect sizes across applicant and occupational characteristics. We also find that certain chronic health conditions and impairments have received more empirical attention than others. Exploring discrimination levels across a wider range of chronic conditions and impairments is necessary to move beyond monolithic understandings of disability as a binary ascriptive status and to discern different causal mechanisms associated with adverse employment outcomes among different subgroups. We argue that intersectional, theoretically grounded, and cross-national experimental approaches are needed to better understand and address disability discrimination in hiring.}

The multifaceted nature of combustion research emphasizes the critical role of knowledge processing in navigating and extracting valuable information from a vast and diverse pool of sources. The developed approach minimizes computational and economic expenses while optimizing data privacy and accuracy. It incorporates prompt engineering and offline open-source LLMs, offering user autonomy in selecting base models. The study provides a thorough examination of text segmentation strategies, conducts comparative studies between LLMs, and explores various optimized prompts to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. By incorporating an external vector database, the framework outperforms a conventional LLM in generating accurate responses and constructing robust arguments. Additionally, the study delves into the investigation of optimized prompt templates for the purpose of efficient extraction of scientific literature. Furthermore, we present a targeted scaling study to quantify the algorithmic performance of the framework as the number of prompt tokens increases. The research addresses concerns related to hallucinations and false research articles by introducing a custom workflow developed with a detection algorithm to filter out inaccuracies. Despite identified areas for improvement, the framework consistently delivers accurate domain-specific responses with minimal human oversight.

Although, the sd1 gene provided early gains in LR, it has now become insufficient in modern cultivars with increased biomass and plant height. Deeper understanding of the intricate morphological and anatomical attributes, mathematical relationships and physical principles governing culm structural strength offer promise for enhancing LR. To unravel the genetic and structural basis of LR, we comprehensively phenotyped 353 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an inter-subspecific cross between Swarna (indica) and IRGC 39111 (tropical japonica), over multiple seasons for 12 culm strength (CS) and seven grain yield (GY) traits. Breaking resistance (BR) as a measure of internode breaking weight (IBW) and section modulus (SM) emerged as primary contributors to LR. Extensive phenotypic evaluations revealed wide variation and high heritability for most CS traits, as reflected in best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) estimates. Conversely, traits like tiller number exhibited low heritability as evidenced by the marked difference between their genotypic and phenotypic coefficients of variation indicating a strong environmental influence traits. Significant phenotypic correlations between CS and GY traits were observed. Histological analysis of the culm revealed that strong culm RILs possessed compact, thickened sclerenchymatous tissue and larger secondary vascular bundles compared to Swarna. NGS based GBS generated 63,367 SNP markers, and a high-density genetic map comprising 11,098 binned SNPs revealed 36 QTLs, including 15 major effect loci. Two consistent and major-effect QTLs—qCT7 (R2-14.49 %; 109 kb) and qIBW7 (R2-16.57 %; 33.83 kb) —on chromosome 7 were identified as key regions for LR. In-silico analysis of qCT7 revealed putative candidate genes including BRITTLE CULM1 like (OsBC1L 6, 7, 8), Cellulose synthase genes (OsCesA 3, 6, 8) and OsCSLF 1, 2, 9 involved in key processes underpinning cell wall thickening. The identification of qCT7 and its future cloning hold potential to enhance lodging resistance in rice, particularly under DSR conditions, contributing to the development of climate-resilient, high-yielding cultivars beyond the Green Revolution paradigm.}

This protracted preclinical phase offers a crucial window for potential therapeutic interventions, yet its comprehensive characterization remains elusive. Accumulating evidence suggests that amyloid-β (Aβ) may mediate neuronal hyperactivity in circuit dysfunction in the early stages of AD. At the same time, neural activity can also facilitate Aβ accumulation through intricate feed-forward interactions, complicating elucidating the conditions governing Aβ-dependent hyperactivity and its diagnostic utility. In this study, we use biophysical modeling to shed light on such conditions. Our analysis reveals that the inherently nonlinear nature of the underlying molecular interactions can give rise to the emergence of various modes of hyperactivity. This diversity in the mechanisms of hyperactivity may ultimately account for a spectrum of AD manifestations.}

Background
Daylight Saving Time (DST) has been a subject of debate concerning its impact on human health, particularly sleep patterns and daytime sleepiness. This systematic review aims to synthesize existing research on the effects of DST on sleep quality, duration, and sleepiness, identifying gaps, and setting a future research agenda.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, according to the PRISMA guidelines. The included studies were those that examined the impact of DST on sleep outcomes and daytime sleepiness in populations aged 6 to 85 years, using objective and subjective measures of sleep.
Results
The review analyzed 27 studies, revealing heterogeneous findings. The transition to DST was associated with adverse effects on sleep duration and quality, as well as increased sleepiness, more evident in evening chronotypes.
Conclusions
Although the transition to DST appears to negatively affect sleep patterns, particularly in spring and among evening chronotypes, definitive conclusions are hampered by methodological inconsistencies and external influences. This review highlights the need for future research employing standardized, objective measures across representative samples to elucidate the true impact of transitions to and from DST and the difference between ST and permanent DST on sleep and daytime functioning. Addressing these gaps is crucial for informed public health policies”.}

However, existing threat hunting systems based on provenance graphs face challenges of high false negatives (FNs), high false positives (FPs), and low efficiency when confronted with diverse attack tactics and voluminous audit logs. To address these issues, we propose a system called Actminer, which constructs query graphs from descriptive relationships in CTI reports for precise threat hunting (i.e., graph alignment) on provenance graphs. First, we present a heuristic search strategy based on equivalent semantic transfer to reduce FNs. Second, we establish a filtering mechanism based on causal relationships of attack behaviors to mitigate FPs. Finally, we design a tree structure to incrementally update the alignment results, significantly improving hunting efficiency. Evaluation on the DARPA Engagement dataset demonstrates that compared with the SOTA POIROT, Actminer reduces FPs by 39.1 %, eliminates all FNs, and effectively counters adversarial attacks.}

In contrast to previous approaches that primarily focus on job recommendations based on a fixed set of concrete job advertisements, our approach involves the creation of a corpus that combines data from the European Skills, Competences, and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy and EURopean Employment Services (EURES) job advertisements, ensuring an up-to-date and well-defined representation of general job titles in the labor market. Our two-step evaluation approach, consisting of an application-grounded evaluation using EURES job advertisements and a human-grounded evaluation using real-world resumes and Human Resources (HR) expert feedback, provides a comprehensive assessment of CareerBERT’s performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that CareerBERT outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art embedding approaches while showing robust effectiveness in human expert evaluations. These results confirm the effectiveness of CareerBERT in supporting career consultants by generating relevant job recommendations based on resumes, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of job consultations and expanding the perspectives of job seekers.

Maximizing resource utilization and ensuring efficient stakeholder coordination within logistics operations pose significant challenges. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has gained increasing interest for its potential to enhance asset and operations management in logistics. However, few studies offer a comprehensive view of DT applications across end-to-end global logistics services, particularly in relation to service innovations and the technological maturity of different service types. This paper conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to explore the state of the art in DT applications in logistics, offering an in-depth understanding of recent research foci, advancements, and opportunities for service innovation. Following the screening process, 70 papers were selected and analyzed. A three-axis framework is used to categorize key aspects of effective DT application, focusing on application areas, service types, and technological maturity as measured by the Technology Readiness Level (TRL). In logistics operations, DT has the potential to innovate or enhance eight key services: Monitoring, Evaluation, Prediction, Optimization, Control, System Management, System Integration, and Adaptation. DTs must be proficient in five core capabilities to deliver these eight services: integration, computation, simulation, interoperation, and evolution. In terms of DT technology maturity, most research focuses on early-stage development, emphasizing conceptual frameworks and exploring potential services. While many studies have tested proposed DT services in simulated environments, only a few have evaluated them in real-world operational settings. Finally, research avenues are explored, providing valuable insights for future investigations and continued development of DT applications in logistics and supply chain management.}

N, N-bis(carboxymethyl)-L-glutamic acid (GLDA) injection has been predicted to increase the permeability of CO2 injection-induced cloud-fracture networks (CFNs) and could serve as an additional stimulation method. Nevertheless, the influence of differential stress, flow geometry, and scale on the characteristics of permeability enhancement by GLDA injection is yet to be clarified. Accordingly, this study experimentally elucidated the permeability enhancement characteristics of injecting a chelating agent in fractured granite under differential stress conditions as an additional method for creating geothermal reservoirs using CO2 injection. GLDA injection experiments were conducted on fractured-granite samples under conventional- and true-triaxial stress states under varying differential stress and pH conditions. Regardless of the differential stress and pH conditions, rock deformation and acoustic emission (AE) were negligible during the chelating agent flow-through experiments on the fractured samples, whereas similar permeability enhancement factors were achieved within the same duration. Thus, stress did not affect the permeability enhancement by chelating agent injections. The permeability enhancement factors were inferred to be high near the injection borehole because of the high viscosity of the solution. Therefore, reservoir stimulation should be conducted using low-concentration chelating agent solutions at constant injection pressures. The study provides insights into the stimulation strategies for creating geothermal reservoirs using CO2 injection.}

The system was analyzed using a direct approach, employing the Laplace transformation method to provide solutions for the system's equations. This methodology enables the computation and presentation of precise equations for several domains of concern, such as displacement, temperature, and thermal stresses. The discussion and analysis focused on a copper-based material, and graphical representations were used to demonstrate the behavior of the researched physical fields. These graphical representations aid in comprehending the development of displacement, temperature, and thermal stresses within the material caused by the laser beam and the interplay between thermal, magnetic, and elastic processes. The results demonstrate that the laser pulse parameters have a significant impact on the temperature and thermal stress distribution, thereby influencing the thermo-mechanical reactions of the solid medium. Ultimately, this study enhances our comprehension of the intricate behavior and interplay of thermal, magnetic, and elastic phenomena in thermoelastic materials.}

However, integration of this technology into work-related lifelong learning contexts has been relatively atheoretical and non-systematic. Building on interdisciplinary adult learning research and our findings from several studies on an online graduate degree program in a high demand STEM field, we propose a multilevel, person-centric framework of adult learning processes related to: (1) knowledge and skill acquisition, (2) the development and maintenance of motivation and wellbeing over time, and (3) transfer of learning to career-related goals. For each level of the framework, we discuss issues related to the measurement and evaluation of learning. We outline affordances (i.e., functional benefits) of technology (including artificial intelligence) for supporting career-related learning at each level, and present future directions related to major gaps in the field's understanding of these affordances. Throughout the final section, we illustrate the implications of our framework with examples of its use in a research institute focused on AI adult learning technologies. Finally, we present guiding questions for researchers and practitioners interested in technology-mediated career-related learning.}

Online dating apps have become increasingly popular in recent years as a tool for finding partners. However, there is a gap in research on the comprehensive factors that influence users’ intentions to prefer online dating apps over traditional means, specifically in Indonesia. The present study thus proposes using web semantic techniques and integrates the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior to get a holistic perspective on predicting users’ intentions in online dating. The questionnaires analyzed using SEM-PLS indicate that the attitude toward online dating is positively affected by the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Additionally, attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy positively affect the intention to utilize online dating apps. The research thus introduces a consolidated technology to offer new insights and implications for the design and marketing of online dating apps by highlighting the importance of user-friendly interfaces, perceived benefits, social influence, and individual confidence in using the apps.}

abstract = {Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services are reshaping digital credit access in India, yet their adoption remains limited due to complex and interrelated consumer barriers. While previous research has explored general fintech or digital payment adoption, there is a significant gap in understanding BNPL-specific barriers, particularly how these barriers influence one another within India’s distinct socio-economic and regulatory landscape. India’s rapid fintech growth, large unbanked population, evolving regulatory environment, and uneven levels of digital and financial literacy make it a unique and urgent case for such inquiry. Thus, this study aims to identify and rank the key barriers to BNPL adoption in the Indian context and analyze their causal interrelationships, and adopts a sequential mixed-methods design for the same. In the qualitative phase, a netnographic analysis of BNPL app reviews—supported by existing literature (specifically Innovation Resistance Theory) and expert insights—was used to identify barriers. In the quantitative phase, the ‘Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory’ (DEMATEL) method was employed to analyze seven identified barriers, categorize them into causal and effect groups, and assess their interdependencies. The findings reveal digital illiteracy as the most influential causal barrier, affecting others such as inertia, privacy concerns, hidden fees and high penalty fees, and negative credit profiles. Impulse buying and regulatory concerns also emerged as key causal factors. The study offers practical recommendations, such as financial education, responsible lending, and regulatory reform, and contributes to BNPL literature by applying a novel methodological lens to an underexplored market. These insights can guide stakeholders seeking to responsibly scale BNPL adoption in India.}

This paper presents a review of 10 ethical reasoning methods suitable for the ICT domain. We have employed a method engineering technique to author metamodels for the methods, which were subsequently subjected to validation by experts proficient in the respective methods. Following a situational method engineering approach, we have also characterised each ethical reasoning method and validated the characterisation with the experts. This has allowed us to develop a tool that helps select the method that is most suitable for a given ethical reasoning situation. Furthermore, we deliberate on the practical application of ethical reasoning methods within conceptual modelling contexts. We are confident that we have laid the groundwork for further research into ethical reasoning of ICT, with a specific emphasis on its role during conceptual modelling.}

abstract = {Background
International Classification of Diseases codes are widely used to describe diagnosis information, but manual coding relies heavily on human interpretation, which can be expensive, time consuming, and prone to errors. With the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), the coding process has become more complex, highlighting the need for automated approaches to enhance coding efficiency and accuracy. Inaccurate coding can result in substantial financial losses for hospitals, and a precise assessment of outcomes generated by a natural language processing (NLP)–driven autocoding system thus assumes a critical role in safeguarding the accuracy of the Taiwan diagnosis related groups (Tw-DRGs).
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of applying an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), autocoding system that can automatically determine diagnoses and codes based on free-text discharge summaries to facilitate the assessment of Tw-DRGs, specifically principal diagnosis and major diagnostic categories (MDCs).
Methods
By using the patient discharge summaries from Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital (KMUCHH) from April 2019 to December 2020 as a reference data set we developed artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted ICD-10-CM coding systems based on deep learning models. We constructed a web-based user interface for the AI-assisted coding system and deployed the system to the workflow of the certified coding specialists (CCSs) of KMUCHH. The data used for the assessment of Tw-DRGs were manually curated by a CCS with the principal diagnosis and MDC was determined from discharge summaries collected at KMUCHH from February 2023 to April 2023.
Results
Both the reference data set and real hospital data were used to assess performance in determining ICD-10-CM coding, principal diagnosis, and MDC for Tw-DRGs. Among all methods, the GPT-2 (OpenAI)-based model achieved the highest F1-score, 0.667 (F1-score 0.851 for the top 50 codes), on the KMUCHH test set and a slightly lower F1-score, 0.621, in real hospital data. Cohen κ evaluation for the agreement of MDC between the models and the CCS revealed that the overall average κ value for GPT-2 (κ=0.714) was approximately 12.2 percentage points higher than that of the hierarchy attention network (κ=0.592). GPT-2 demonstrated superior agreement with the CCS across 6 categories of MDC, with an average κ value of approximately 0.869 (SD 0.033), underscoring the effectiveness of the developed AI-assisted coding system in supporting the work of CCSs.
Conclusions
An NLP-driven AI-assisted coding system can assist CCSs in ICD-10-CM coding by offering coding references via a user interface, demonstrating the potential to reduce the manual workload and expedite Tw-DRG assessment. Consistency in performance affirmed the effectiveness of the system in supporting CCSs in ICD-10-CM coding and the judgment of Tw-DRGs.}

abstract = {Background:
Antibiotic resistance increasingly threatens the interconnected health of humans, animals, and the environment. While misuse of antibiotics is a known driver, environmental factors also play a critical role. A balanced One Health approach—including the environmental sector—is necessary to understand the emergence and spread of resistance.
Methods:
We systematically searched English-language literature (1990–2021) in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, plus grey literature. Titles, abstracts, and keywords were screened, followed by full-text reviews using a structured codebook and dual-reviewer assessments.
Results:
Of 13,667 records screened, 738 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies focused on freshwater and terrestrial environments, particularly associated with wastewater or manure sources. Evidence of research has predominantly focused on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp., with a concentration on ARGs conferring resistance to sulphonamides (sul1–3), tetracyclines (tet), and beta-lactams. Additionally, the People’s Republic of China has produced a third of the studies—twice that of the next country, the United States—and research was largely domestic, with closely linked author networks.
Conclusion:
Significant evidence gaps persist in understanding antibiotic resistance in non-built environments, particularly in marine, atmospheric, and non-agricultural settings. Stressors such as climate change and microplastics remain notably under-explored. There is also an urgent need for more research in low-income regions, which face higher risks of antibiotic resistance, to support the development of targeted, evidence-based interventions.}

The results reveal that recommendations by ChatGPT and the existing AI recommender similarly influence the consumer purchase journey from perceived performance (PP) toward intention to adopt a consideration set (IC) via trust in the recommender (TR) and trust in recommended products (TP). However, ChatGPT has a higher impact of PP on TR and a higher IC than the existing AI recommender. The higher the level of brand awareness, the higher the TP, but the gap is narrowed by the moderating effect significantly at low and medium levels but not at high level, which leads to IC. The study underscores the importance of marketers enhancing brand awareness despite the effectiveness of AI recommenders in influencing consumer choice. This empirical comparative study contributes to marketing literature by elucidating the interplay between ChatGPT, AI recommenders, consumer choice and brand awareness.}

Traditional empirical methods often fail to capture the complex interactions between flow, sediment, and pier geometry, leading to inaccurate scour depth predictions. This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based approach to improve scour depth prediction accuracy and interpretability. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from experimental studies reported in the literature, encompassing a range of pier configurations, sediment characteristics, and fluid properties under steady current conditions in both clear-water and live-bed environments. Advanced ML models, including ensemble techniques (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forest (RF)), deep learning models (Neural Network (NN), 1D convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), Deep neural network (DNN)), and traditional methods (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Logistic regression (LR)), were implemented and evaluated. XGBoost demonstrated the highest predictive performance, outperforming both empirical methods and other ML models, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.85 on the testing dataset between the predicted and observed results. Model interpretability was enhanced using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which highlighted the importance of features such as pier geometry, sediment properties, and fluid dynamics. Pile diameter (bp) and pile spacing in the perpendicular flow directions (Sn) were identified as the most influential parameters in determining normalized scour depth, followed by bottom pile cap elevation (h0), pile cap longitudinal extension from column (f1), and pile cap thickness (T), which also play significant roles. In contrast, pile spacing parallel to the flow direction (Sm), the number of pile lines parallel to the flow direction (n), and shape factor of CBP exhibited minimal influence. The proposed ML framework not only outperforms conventional methods but also provides interpretable predictions, offering a reliable tool to support scour risk assessment in bridge design and maintenance.}

While AI-driven solutions have been applied to generic supply chain optimization, they often fail in addressing the unique challenges of SMFs, where HVAC systems must maintain sub-0.1 °C temperature stability, account for 40–60 % of facility energy consumption, and comply with stringent cleanroom standards. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates graph-based large multimodal models (G-LMMs), enhanced by graph neural networks (GNNs), to optimize SMF HVAC supply chains across the Design, Construction, Installation, Maintenance, and Operation (DCIMO) phases. GNNs enable the capture and analysis of complex relationships within HVAC systems, facilitating real-time anomaly detection and optimized material flows. Unlike conventional AI models, G-LMMs combine GNNs with multimodal data processing to achieve three key advancements: (1) real-time anomaly detection, (2) automated compliance monitoring, and (3) circular economy integration through resource reuse. G-LMMs enhance supply chain visibility by harmonizing diverse data types while meeting SMFs' precision requirements. As the first framework to unify GNNs and multimodal AI for HVAC optimization, this approach represents a paradigm shift in sustainable semiconductor manufacturing, with broader implications for industries reliant on precision-controlled environments.}

Unlike previous industrial revolutions, Industry 5.0 prioritizes the integration of human workers alongside advanced technologies, emphasizing collaboration, and acknowledging the unique strengths of both humans and machines, with a focus on human well-being. However, this transition presents significant challenges to adopting cobots in industries due to safety concerns compromising efficiency. While robotics and automation traditionally focus on maximizing performance and minimizing human intervention, the latter no longer applies to human-robot collaboration. There is a need for developing approaches and technologies that can seamlessly combine high-level robotic performance with safety, as well as pursue operator well-being. This paper presents a vision and specific recommendations for a harmonious synergy between robot performance and operator well-being in human-robot collaboration. Our vision includes the need to develop cobots that are contextually intelligent, capable of meaningful conversation, and adaptable to changing conditions. The paper identifies current challenges, such as safety concerns impacting performance, a narrow safety focus and overlooked system-wide impacts, limited guidance on well-being, and insufficient interdisciplinary approaches. To overcome the identified challenges, key recommendations essential for achieving the vision are outlined, and pathways to overcome remaining obstacles are presented. These recommendations include designing context-aware, cognitively embodied, and socially proficient cobots; balancing autonomy and control in task allocation; and adopting a socio-technical systems perspective. Although numerous technical obstacles remain, the rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in generative AI, provide an extraordinary and previously unattainable catalyst for realizing our vision, serving as a fundamental enabler. Our methodology combines expert synthesis and a narrative literature review, drawing on diverse academic domains such as robotics, industrial manufacturing, safety, and human factors. This paper advances human-robot collaboration research by adopting a holistic approach that integrates engineering and non-engineering perspectives, emphasizing technical performance, safety, well-being, and socio-technical systems to optimize collaboration. We aim to inspire and guide both the engineering and robotics community and the human factors and safety community toward developing more holistic, safer, and human-centered collaborative robotic systems. By embracing the interdisciplinary approach, we advocate in this paper, both technical and non-technical experts can benefit from the insights provided.}

abstract = {While artificial intelligence’s (AI) promise for fake online review detection has been investigated, other questions have emerged with ChatGPT’s introduction, a generative AI platform. This research provides a much-needed investigation into consumer reactions to reviews perceived to be generated by ChatGPT vs. a human. Results from three studies in TripAdvisor hotel review and Yelp restaurant review contexts revealed that consumers rate reviews as less useful, trustworthy, and authentic if they perceived ChatGPT generated them. Further, the findings were robust regardless of review valence and even when participants were informed the reviewer possessed a TripAdvisor Expert badge. These findings’ theoretical and practical implications are discussed, along with limitations.}

Although hand–foot skin reaction is not life threatening, severe cases impair quality of life because of pain and reduced activities of daily living. However, the pathological mechanisms of hand–foot skin reaction have not yet been elucidated in detail, and there is currently no effective treatment. We aimed to identify keratinocyte cytoprotectants against sorafenib toxicity. The screening of cytoprotectants against sorafenib toxicity was performed using cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes or a reconstructed human epidermis model and off-patent approved drugs in the Prestwick Chemical library. Among 1273 drugs in the chemical library, 8 dose-dependently increased cell viability by >200% in the presence of sorafenib. In the presence of sorafenib, the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen–positive cells was significantly higher in clofazimine-, cyclosporin A–, and itraconazole-treated reconstructed human epidermis models than in sorafenib-treated models, and candidate drugs suppressed sorafenib-induced apoptosis in normal human epidermal keratinocytes. In addition, clofazimine, itraconazole, and pyrvinium pamoate significantly recovered the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 in the presence of sorafenib. Collectively, hit drugs promoted cell viability and normalized keratinocyte proliferation in the presence of sorafenib. These candidate drugs have potential as treatments for multikinase inhibitor–induced hand–foot skin reaction.}

Younger, less-educated, and lower-income individuals, as well as those who perceive a greater lack of control, are more afraid of automation, while gender does not show a significant effect. In conclusion, we discuss how fear of automation may impact reskilling motivation in organizational practices.}

Plasma and tissue samples were analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC for B(a)P metabolites. In addition to these studies, DNA isolated from colon and liver tissues was analyzed for B(a)P-induced DNA adducts by the 32P-postlabeling method using a thin-layer chromatography system. Western diet consumption resulted in a marked increase in DME expression and B(a)P metabolite concentrations in rats that were administered 100 µg/kg B(a)P + WD (p < 0.05) compared to other treatment groups. Our findings demonstrate that WD accelerates the development of colon tumors induced by B(a)P through enhanced biotransformation, and the products of this process (metabolites) were found to bind with DNA and form B(a)P-DNA adducts, which may have given rise to colon polyps characterized by gain in tumor number, sizes, and dysplasia.}

abstract = {Background
Metabolic reprogramming has recently been recognized as a critical driver in the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). While Songorine has been shown to modulate macrophage metabolism, its direct effects on chondrocyte metabolism and inflammation remain poorly understood.
Purpose
This study set out to explore how Songorine regulates glycolysis-driven inflammation in OA chondrocytes and to elucidate a novel mechanism linking metabolic reprogramming, histone lactylation, and inflammatory signaling.
Study Design
We utilized both in vivo OA rat models and in vitro IL-1β-induced chondrocyte inflammation models to assess Songorine's metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects.
Methods
Histological and biochemical analyses were performed on OA rat joints to evaluate cartilage degeneration, metabolic alterations, and inflammatory markers. RNA sequencing, ¹³C-glucose metabolic flux assays, and Seahorse extracellular flux analysis were used to characterize glycolytic activity. Histone lactylation levels were assessed by immunoblotting and CUT&Tag. The binding between Songorine and PFKFB3 was evaluated by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
Results
OA cartilage exhibited elevated glycolysis and inflammation, while Songorine treatment significantly restored metabolic homeostasis and alleviated inflammation. In IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes, Songorine suppressed glycolytic flux, reduced lactate production and histone H4K12 lactylation. Lactate-induced H4K12 lactylation promoted the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and reinforced a PFKFB3-mediated positive feedback loop that sustained glycolysis and inflammation. SPR confirmed that Songorine directly binds to and inhibits PFKFB3, thereby disrupting this loop.
Conclusion
Songorine protects cartilage by directly targeting PFKFB3, thereby limiting glycolytic-driven lactate production, histone lactylation, and downstream inflammatory signaling. These findings uncover a novel glycolysis–lactylation–inflammation axis in OA and support Songorine as a promising metabolic modulator for OA therapy.}

Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., BERT, Bard, Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), LLaMA, etc., have the ability to take instructions, or prompts, from users and generate answers and solutions based on very large volumes of text-based training data. This paper assesses the impact and potential impact of ChatGPT on the field of digital forensics, specifically looking at its latest pre-trained LLM, GPT-4. A series of experiments are conducted to assess its capability across several digital forensic use cases including artefact understanding, evidence searching, code generation, anomaly detection, incident response, and education. Across these topics, its strengths and risks are outlined and a number of general conclusions are drawn. Overall this paper concludes that while there are some potential low-risk applications of ChatGPT within digital forensics, many are either unsuitable at present, since the evidence would need to be uploaded to the service, or they require sufficient knowledge of the topic being asked of the tool to identify incorrect assumptions, inaccuracies, and mistakes. However, to an appropriately knowledgeable user, it could act as a useful supporting tool in some circumstances.}

Such disruption may lead to bacterial translocation, subsequently triggering enterohepatic and systemic inflammation. Impaired intestinal barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, particularly chronic gut and liver diseases. In this review, we will summarize the fundamental functions of intestinal barrier and discuss clinical correlations between intestinal barrier dysfunction and diseases such as colitis, colorectal cancer, and chronic liver diseases including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

However, supervised learning methods have encountered several common challenges, such as overfitting and underfitting, in the process of mineral prospectivity modeling, particularly due to imbalanced sample sizes used for model training. This imbalance could limit the generalization capability of models and result in inadequate predictive performance of individual models. The present study introduced a novel hybrid ensemble model (HEM) that integrates various learner methods, including generative adversarial network (GAN) and transfer learning techniques, to effectively address the issues above. These intelligent prediction techniques were applied to analyze the geological, geochemical, and geophysical dataset in order to delineate potential areas for W-Sn mineralization in Malipo County, Yunnan Province, China. Meanwhile, some well-established supervised learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Boosting-based model (e.g., LightGBM), and Bagging-based models, which demonstrated exceptional performance in dealing with classification issues were also integrated into the HEM. The weights for integrating these models were determined automatically using the equidistant-sampling technique. The superior performance of the HEM in identifying known deposits made it an efficient tool for mineral prediction mapping. Additionally, this model also offered high flexibility and scalability by allowing adjustments to the types and quantities of base learners based on data characteristics.}

abstract = {Background
The use of real-world data (RWD) warehouses for research in Asia is on the rise, but current trends remain largely unexplored. Given the varied economic and health care landscapes in different Asian countries, understanding these trends can offer valuable insights.
Objective
We sought to discern the contemporary landscape of linked RWD warehouses and explore their trends and patterns in 3 Asian countries with contrasting economies and health care systems: Taiwan, India, and Thailand.
Methods
Using a systematic scoping review methodology, we conducted an exhaustive literature search on PubMed with filters for the English language and the past 5 years. The search combined Medical Subject Heading terms and specific keywords. Studies were screened against strict eligibility criteria to identify eligible studies using RWD databases from more than one health care facility in at least 1 of the 3 target countries.
Results
Our search yielded 2277 studies, of which 833 (36.6%) met our criteria. Overall, single-country studies (SCS) dominated at 89.4% (n=745), with cross-country collaboration studies (CCCS) being at 10.6% (n=88). However, the country-wise breakdown showed that of all the SCS, 623 (83.6%) were from Taiwan, 81 (10.9%) from India, and 41 (5.5%) from Thailand. Among the total studies conducted in each country, India at 39.1% (n=133) and Thailand at 43.1% (n=72) had a significantly higher percentage of CCCS compared to Taiwan at 7.6% (n=51). Over a 5-year span from 2017 to 2022, India and Thailand experienced an annual increase in RWD studies by approximately 18.2% and 13.8%, respectively, while Taiwan’s contributions remained consistent. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) was predominant in Taiwan (n=410, or 65.8% of SCS) but less common in India (n=12, or 14.8% of SCS) and Thailand (n=11, or 26.8% of SCS). CER percentages in CCCS were similar across the 3 countries, ranging from 19.2% (n=10) to 29% (n=9). The type of RWD source also varied significantly across countries, with India demonstrating a high reliance on electronic medical records or electronic health records at 55.6% (n=45) of SCS and Taiwan showing an increasing trend in their use over the period. Registries were used in 26 (83.9%) CCCS and 31 (75.6%) SCS from Thailand but in <50% of SCS from Taiwan and India. Health insurance/administrative claims data were used in most of the SCS from Taiwan (n=458, 73.5%). There was a consistent predominant focus on cardiology/metabolic disorders in all studies, with a noticeable increase in oncology and infectious disease research from 2017 to 2022.
Conclusions
This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of RWD research in Taiwan, India, and Thailand. The observed differences and trends emphasize the unique economic, clinical, and research settings in each country, advocating for tailored strategies for leveraging RWD for future health care research and decision-making.

Beating behavior of induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from a symptomatic individual and an asymptomatic individual carrying a mutation for Brugada syndrome was analyzed with Ca2+ imaging method. Using machine learning methods, it is studied whether it is possible to classify the current peak data successfully and whether differences in the two mutant cell lines could be observed. We applied more machine learning methods than before. Baseline signals were first recorded and they were then exposed to adrenaline and these to an antiarrhythmic drug flecainide which should provoke the disease phenotype. Calcium transient signals derived from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were used for all computational analyses executed. Good classification results were generated with effective machine learning methods. Various test situations were applied to study how different parts of data can be separated to ensure their differences. Good results were gained that support the target so that it is possible to analyze whether the drug impacted on iPSC-CMs. It is also possible to separate which cells were affected by the drug and which were not affected. An important finding was that there were significant differences between calcium transient signals data originated from control subjects and patients and also between responses of the cells from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.}

The method is applied to the Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico, where we address three key questions: (1) What are the daily summer transpiration rates of Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and Creosote (Larrea tridentata) individuals, and how do these species contribute to footprint-scale evapotranspiration? (2) How can the plant-level measurements be integrated for terrain-wide transpiration estimates? (3) What is the contribution of transpiration to total evapotranspiration within the eddy covariance footprint? Data collected from June to October 2022, during the North American Monsoon season, include hourly evapotranspiration and precipitation rates from the Ameriflux eddy covariance system (US Jo-1 Bajada site) and sap flux rates from heat-balance sensors. We used plant biometric measurements and supervised classification of multispectral imagery to upscale from the patch to footprint-scale estimations. A proportional relationship between the plant’s horizontal projected area and the estimated number of water flow conduits was extended to the eddy covariance footprint via UAS data. Our results show that Mesquite’s average daily summer transpiration is 2.84 mm/d, while Creosote’s is 1.78 mm/d (a ratio of 1.6:1). The summer footprint integrated transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio (T/ET) was 0.50, decreasing to 0.44 during dry spells and increasing to 0.63 following significant precipitation. Further testing of this method is needed in different regions to validate its applicability. With appropriate adjustments, it could be relevant for other areas with similar ecological conditions.}

Design of inquisitive bots which ask questions on a given topic of interest is one such application. To improve the quality of questions generated by such a bot while leveraging the power of transformer models, it is necessary to add a component to the pipeline that also considers the topic of discussion. This research examines transformer models pre-trained on natural language with the addition of topic context and subsequent optimization using genetic algorithms to generate more relevant questions. In our hybrid framework, we first use topic modeling for extracting context from the conversation history and then use these topics as input in the conversational training pipeline for generating questions on the given category. We attempt to fine-tune the framework to find the optimized weights using genetic algorithm. Our experiments are carried out using a large-scale dataset that is readily available to the public for the purpose of conversational question generation. We further evaluate the trained models on a dataset of Java passages performing qualitative analysis. Our analysis suggests that utilizing the genetic algorithm-optimized topic aware mechanism improves the quality of generated questions substantially in the conversational set-up.}

In this study, multiple one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) are developed for automatically extracting implicit damage-sensitive features from the structural raw dynamic responses to localize damage in the pile foundations of pedestrian bridges considering uncertainties such as environmental and operational variations (EOVs) inherent in dynamic responses. For this purpose, transient dynamics numerical computation models are established to simulate the multi-point dynamic response of the structure under different typical damage scenarios, forming the baseline dataset. Then, on-site vibration tests are conducted on the structural prototype. Ambient vibrations of the real intact bridge are considered EOVs and integrated into the baseline dataset, forming the test dataset. Additionally, the intact structural dynamic response with measured EOVs replaces the simulated intact structural dynamic response in the baseline dataset to form a reference dataset. The network architectures based on one-dimensional convolutional layers proposed in this paper are trained on the baseline dataset and reference datasets to obtain baseline and reference models. Subsequently, model performance evaluation is conducted on the test dataset, and the results indicate a significant decrease in the performance of damage models based on a single deep learning when EOVs are present. However, integrating the baseline and reference models achieves zero false negative/positive predictions which is safety-oriented and an exemplary classification accuracy of up to 97.2 %.}

However, entrepreneurs propose these projects within a context of information asymmetry and risk uncertainty which prospective backers must grapple with. Although Kickstarter has been requiring technology entrepreneurs to disclose project risk information since 2012, the value of this disclosure remains underexplored amidst controversies in the literature about whether project risk description enhances crowdfunding success. In addressing these issues, this research employs signaling theory and curvilinear analysis to examine what project risk description length and sentiment levels maximize crowdfunding success for technology projects, particularly those in developing countries. Statistical analyses of 1059 campaigns on Kickstarter partly support and challenge this study's theorizations. Risk description sentiment and length have U-shaped and inverted U-shaped effects on crowdfunding success respectively. Although these effects do not differ across projects in developed and developing countries, detailed risk descriptions generally yield better results for projects in developing countries. These insights advance and clarify the underdeveloped literature on the link between project risk description and crowdfunding outcomes and offer guidance on how developing country entrepreneurs can couch project risk statements to optimize crowdfunding success.}

Especially, our study examined how social, personal, and technological factors (social influence, hedonic motivation, and anthropomorphism) contributed to their cognitive appraisal and emotional experience with GenAI, analyzed how these cognitive-emotional responses affected their GenAI-powered learning productivity, and explored how this influential mechanism differs across various groups. We surveyed 2,026 Chinese undergraduates who had used GenAI in their studies. The findings indicated that the influence from others on using GenAI and hedonic motivation toward using GenAI were positively related to undergraduates’ appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge and negatively related to their view of it as a hindrance. Conversely, the anthropomorphic features of GenAI showed the opposite pattern. Undergraduates who viewed using GenAI as a challenge reported more positive emotions and demonstrated higher GenAI-powered learning productivity. Those who saw it as a hindrance experienced more negative emotions but showed no significant relationship with GenAI-powered learning productivity. Moreover, undergraduate students’ appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge or a hindrance and their emotional experiences played mediating roles in this influential process. Importantly, these relationships varied significantly across different student groups, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in GenAI integration. Our study provides insights for educators and policymakers on effectively integrating GenAI in higher education.}

abstract = {In pursuing the goals of sustainable development and transiting from fossil fuel-dependent electricity generation to renewable and sustainable alternatives as endorsed by COP28, Malaysia set a 31 % target for renewable-energy in the power generation mix by 2025. This underlines Malaysia's commitment to combat climate change, mainly by reducing its economy-wide GDP carbon intensity by 45 % from the 2005 levels by 2030. To better understand the effects of renewable energy expansion on the economy, environment, electricity output and input-mix, a computable general equilibrium model is applied using an updated benchmark. The simulation results show that increasing the share of coal and gas in the power generation mix compromises emission reduction targets. Further, there is a trade-off between subsidized natural gas supplies and power generation and exports. The results also show that a larger proportion of renewable energy leads to improved welfare. As the share of gas and coal in renewable energy generation is not very high, its impact on carbon emissions is limited. However, if renewable energy expansion is complemented by subsidy rationalizations, the positive impacts are more pronounced. In terms of policy implications, the findings suggest that Malaysia must step up its emission reduction efforts by augmenting the generation of renewable rather than non-renewable resources. Complementary initiatives such as emission abatement policies and consumption subsidies for refined oil products and fossil-fuel power generation should be rationalized to expand renewable resources, improve energy security, and attain emission reductions.}

abstract = {Objective
This article reviews the cellular and rheologic mechanisms of neovascularization (NV) and fibrinolysis in chronic ischemia. These mechanisms provide an explanation for the proteomic and cytometry data obtained from patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) who were successfully treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).
Rationale
G-CSF was used in CLTI to promote NV by progenitor cell mobilization. This review was prompted by the significant G-CSF-induced neutrophilia after each G-CSF administration. Neutrophils had been considered antiangiogenic and prothrombotic. However, angiographic evidence of arteriogenesis and fibrinolysis was observed in patients with CLTI treated with a novel G-CSF regimen (filgrastim 7-10 μg/kg every 72 hours for up to 10 doses). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays identified significant (P < .01) elevation of the concentration proangiogenic serum proteins and of plasmin (>10-fold) and fibrin degradation products (>5-fold) in plasma. Levels peaked one day after each G-CSF dose, as did the absolute neutrophil count. Levels decreased toward baseline before the next dose, in conjunction with the absolute neutrophil count. No hemorrhage occurred during the month of G-CSF treatment.
Methods
Multi-disciplinary literature review facilitated by artificial intelligence.
Results
Evidence has emerged regarding the context-dependent role of neutrophils in modulating both angiogenesis and fibrinolysis. The proangiogenic impact of activated neutrophils includes the release of hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and angiopoietin 1. The increase in these same proteins 24 hours after G-CSF administration in the CLTI population treated above may thus be attributable to neutrophilia. Moreover, neutrophils secrete proteases that degrade thrombus and have context-dependent fibrinolytic capacity.
Conclusions
Induced neutrophilia can promote a proangiogenic and profibrinolytic environment in the specific context of chronically ischemic tissue. This article was prepared to facilitate further research into this potential transformative medical treatment for CLTI, with benefit potential in other chronically ischemic beds.}

To avoid production disruptions caused by robot failures, higher requirements are imposed on the resilience of systems, specifically in terms of resistance, response, and recovery capabilities. In response to this, this paper investigates the resilient scheduling framework for multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop, thereby endowing and enhancing the resilience of the system. Within the resilient scheduling framework, a proactive scheduling method maximizing resistance capability is firstly proposed based on an improved NSGA-III with variable neighborhood search. Secondly, to improve the response and recovery capabilities of the system, a recovery scheduling method is presented. Therein, an adaptive trigger policy based on deep reinforcement learning is introduced to enhance the rapid response capability for disturbances, while the recovery optimization grants the system the ability to recover its performance that has been degraded due to the impact of disturbances. Finally, through simulation experiments and case study, it is verified that the proposed algorithms and framework possess superior performance of multi-objective optimization, which can endow the multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop with resilience to against uncertain robot failures.}

Sentiment analysis and stance detection are interrelated problems of affective computing, and their outputs commonly complement each other. The focus of this article is to determine sentiments and stances of Twitter users about vaccination. A tweet dataset on COVID-19 vaccination is compiled and jointly annotated with sentiment and stance. This deep learning approach employs BERT, which is a model based on pre-trained transformers. The generative deep learning model, ChatGPT, is also used for stance and sentiment analysis on the dataset. ChatGPT achieves the best performance for stance detection, while BERT is the best performer for sentiment analysis. This study is the first one to observe stance and sentiment detection performance of ChatGPT on health-related tweets. This article also includes a full-fledged system proposal based on automatic sentiment and stance analysis. COVID-19 pandemic is an impactful global public health phenomenon, and hence, joint extraction of sentiments and stances from health-related tweets can profoundly contribute to health-related decision-making processes.}

abstract = {Despite rapid healthcare digitization, extracting information from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), such as nursing notes, remains challenging due to inconsistencies and ambiguities in clinical documentation. Generative large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for automating information extraction (IE); however, their application in real-world clinical settings, such as residential aged care (RAC), is limited by critical gaps. Prior studies have often focused on structured EHR data and conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, overlooking critical aspects like robustness, fairness, bias, and contextual relevance, particularly in unstructured clinical narratives. To address these gaps, this study develops a holistic evaluation framework for clinical IE from free-text nursing notes in the Australian RAC. We systematically evaluate 17 LLMs, including general-purpose and healthcare-specific variants (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, Gemini, T5) across retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and few-shot learning configurations (one-shot, three-shot, four-shot, five-shot). The evaluation focuses on two clinical IE tasks: named entity recognition (NER) and summarization. Results reveal LLaMA 3.1 achieved 88.58 % accuracy, 87.43 % F1 score in NER, 88.18 % F1 score, and 83.15 % relevance in summarization. However, robustness remained low (4.00 % for NER, 4.31 % for summarization) despite excellent fairness (99.9 %) and minimal bias (0.11 %) in both tasks. Further, healthcare-specific LLMs slightly outperform general models, and RAG-based approaches (LangChain, LlamaIndex) yield superior results. Task-specific optimal few-shot settings emerged: three-shot for NER and five-shot for summarization. This study provides a foundation for safely integrating generative AI into clinical decision support.}

abstract = {Durian (Durio zibethinus L.), an economically important fruit crop in Southeast Asia, is known for its strong sulfuryl aroma resulting from the accumulation of sulfur-containing compounds. However, our understanding of sulfur metabolism in fruit remains limited. In this study, we focused on the functional characterization of durian methionine γ-lyase (DzMGL), the key enzyme in volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production. In addition, to gain a better insight into sulfur metabolism, we profiled metabolites related to this process using various methods and assessed the expression of relevant genes through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Our gene and metabolite analyses revealed that sulfur metabolism is activated during ripening. Interestingly, DzMGL exhibited a higher efficiency in using L-cysteine than Arabidopsis MGL. The differential levels of the produced VSCs explained the aroma intensity-related differences between the two commercial Thai cultivars ‘Chanee’ and ‘Monthong’. Furthermore, the cysteine availability-related differences between the two cultivars could contribute to this variation, with ‘Chanee’ containing higher cysteine levels than ‘Monthong’. Our findings indicated that γ-glutamylcysteine was the preferred form of sulfur storage in durian pulps, with a potential recycling process providing intermediates that flux methionine toward ethylene biosynthesis and VSC production. This study provides novel insights into sulfur metabolism in durian fruit.}

Drawing on distributed cognition theory, which views AI as an extension of human cognition, this study explores how strengthening human agency can improve student-AI collaborative creative performance and support learners’ development. In Experiment 1 (N = 170), students collaborated with AI on a creative problem-solving task, during which they were asked to think independently before or after collaborating with AI. Subjective experiences such as agency and perceived cognitive improvement were measured by questionnaires. The results showed that pre-collaboration thinking improved prompts quality and perceived cognitive improvement but did not enhance final creative output, possibly due to the limited persistence of human agency. Furthermore, Experiment 2 (N = 176) employed a similar task and measurements, and required students to integrate their own ideas with AI-generated content. This led to sustained improvements in both human agency and prompts quality, ultimately enhancing the creativity of final outputs and perceived cognitive improvement. These findings extend the application of distributed cognition theory to AI-supported creativity, highlighting the critical role of human-led idea integration and offering a novel perspective for future research on computer-supported creativity cultivation.}

French Broad River Basin, southeastern United States
Study focus
We combined fluvial and dendro-based paleoflood hydrologic data with instrumented data to understand long-term changes in extreme flow events.
New hydrological insights for the region
Droughts and extreme floods are underrepresented in streamflow records because of short instrumentation records. This study is among the first to develop a centennial-scale record (1734–2024) of hydrologic extreme events in the southeastern U.S. Interannual and interdecadal variability of extreme floods and droughts was observed. This suggests that hydrologic volatility is a persistent pattern in basins where precipitation is heavily influenced by the Bermuda High (North Atlantic subtropical high) and El Niño Southern Oscillation. Landfalling hurricanes generated some of the largest floods in the record. A late spring flood in 1791 CE, however, surpassed the magnitude of all other floods (0.0025 annual exceedance probability), including the 2024 CE Hurricane Helene flood (0.02 annual exceedance probability). Flood frequency and magnitude has declined since the 1800s, however. In contrast, drought severity has increased in the last century. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest flood frequency analyses reliant on floods-of-record from the last century to represent flood extremes may be underestimating flood risks, and droughts and extreme floods both occur on annual and decadal timescales, setting the stage for frequent sequencing of hydrologic extremes in the southeastern U.S.}
