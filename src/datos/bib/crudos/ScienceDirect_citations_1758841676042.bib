abstract = {Introduction
Baihu Jia Renshen Decoction is composed of Gypsum Fibrosum, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Oryza Sativa L., Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma. It is recommended by five guidelines in China for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, evaluations of its efficacy involve a diverse range of outcomes. This multi-method study aims to identify clinical outcomes that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners consider both predictive of T2DM progression and responsive to the formula, and to explore the herbal formula’s mechanisms of action on these outcomes.
Methods
We searched eight databases and collated clinical outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials, as well as signs and symptoms of clinical response listed in TCM clinical guidelines. A panel of eight TCM clinicians participated in three rounds of Delphi surveys to select the most important outcomes. Finally, overlapping genes between responsive outcomes-related genes and the targets of formula were obtained. Based on the enrichment analysis results, the“herb-compound-target-pathway-outcome” relationship was constructed to show how the formula affect clinical outcomes.
Results
Seventy-six outcomes were shortlisted from the literature, from which consensus was reached in the Delphi survey on eight. These were xerostomia, polydipsia, preference for cold drinks, red tongue, dry tongue, tongue coating dryness, large pulse and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Fifteen overlapping gene targets were identified. Based on enrichment analysis, we hypothesized that diosgenin, nicotinic acid, and anhydroicaritin from Anemarrhenae Rhizoma may act on SOD1, PPARGC1A, CHRM3, modulating AMPK signaling pathway and thereby influencing xerostomia and tongue dryness. The 29 components were found to act on PPARG, PPARGC1A, SHBG, etc, regulating insulin signaling pathway and the AMPK signaling pathway, ultimately affecting FBG.
Conclusion
Based on the network pharmacology studies, the potential mechanisms of action of Baihu Jia Renshen Decoction on the eight core clinical outcomes are as follows. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma may regulate dryness of the tongue and xerostomia. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma may modulate FBG levels. Further research is needed to explore the formula’s mechanisms of action for the remaining five outcomes and T2DM.}

abstract = {The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) categorizes postpartum depression (PPD) as a subtype of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with peripartum onset, generally arising within the initial trimester following delivery. This acute psychiatric condition is characterized by feelings of worthlessness, insomnia, extreme anxiety, or maternal neglect. Intranasal oxytocin (OT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have the potential to address impaired social cognition; nonetheless, their neuronal underpinnings, along with their safety and efficacy, are little comprehended. This study examines the effects of rTMS stimulation with an oxytocin agonist or antagonist in a PPD model. We employed the maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) strategy for 21 days to attain our objective. Oxytocin acetate (agonist) and atosiban (antagonist) were administered by injection twice daily for three consecutive days following the model according to the established protocol. A single session of rTMS involved the application of high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) one hour following the final injection. Behavioral testing and brain collection were conducted 12 h post-rTMS. The results indicated that treatment with OT followed by rTMS stimulation decreased neuronal cell death and microglial activation, meanwhile enhancing synaptic plasticity through the upregulation of PSD95, Synapsin I, and Synaptophysin. Simultaneously, both OT therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrated a significant capacity to alter autophagy activity and astrocyte function. Nonetheless, OTA therapy followed by rTMS did not exhibit the same pattern of outcomes. Our findings indicate that the combination of rTMS stimulation and an oxytocin agonist in a PPD model may mitigate depression-like behavior.}

A total of 447 complete sequences were obtained from individuals aged from 13 days to 18 years, between March 2020 and September 2022: 369 sequences generated during this study and 78 ones, available in GISAID, previously obtained from Tunisian pediatric patients. These sequences were compared with 354 and 274 ones obtained from Tunisian adults and a global dataset, respectively. The variant circulation dynamics of predominant variants were investigated during the study period using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis. Among the studied population, adolescents were the predominant age group, comprising 55.26% of cases. Twenty-three lineages were identified; seven of which were not previously reported in Tunisia. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between the sequences from Tunisian adults and children. The connections of sequences from other countries were variable according to variants: close relationships were observed for Alpha, B1.160 and Omicron variants, while independent Tunisian clusters were observed for Delta and B.1.177 lineages. These findings highlight the pivotal role of children in virus transmission and underscore the impact of vaccination on virus spread. Vaccination of children, with booster doses, may be considered for better management of future emergences.}

Knowledge on prevalence and association of human papillomavirus (HPV) in third trimester placentae and adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited. We investigated the prevalence of placental HPV at delivery, explored urine HPV characteristics associated with placental HPV and whether placental HPV increased the risk adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Methods
Pregnant women were enrolled in the Scandinavian PreventADALL mother-child cohort study at midgestation. Human papillomavirus genotyping was performed on placental biopsies collected at delivery (n = 587) and first-void urine at midgestation and delivery (n = 556). Maternal characteristics were collected by questionnaires at gestational week 18 and 34. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were registered from chart data including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus and newborns small for gestational age. Uni- and multivariable regression models were used to investigate associations.
Results
Placental HPV was detected in 18/587 (3 %). Twenty-eight genotypes were identified among the 214/556 (38 %) with midgestational urine HPV. Seventeen of the 18 women with placental HPV were midgestational HPV positive with 89 % genotype concordance. Midgestational high-risk-(HR)-HPV and high viral loads of Any- or HR-HPV were associated with placental HPV. Persisting HPV infection from midgestation to delivery was not associated with placental HPV. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were seen in 2/556 (0.4 %) of women with placental HPV.
Discussion
In this general cohort of pregnant women, the prevalence of placental HPV was 3 %, and midgestational urinary HPV 38 %. High HPV viral load increased the risk for placental HPV infections. We observed no increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with placental HPV.}

Although 2D CT images provide valuable pore-scale data, the scarcity of real-world datasets limits the effectiveness of advanced analysis. Generative AI presents a promising approach for synthesizing high-quality rock images but faces key challenges, including high computational demands, insufficient evaluation metrics, and the trade-off between image fidelity and diversity. To address these limitations, this study proposes the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning stable diffusion models, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining image quality. A systematic investigation was conducted to evaluate the influence of LoRA training parameters, including rank and learning rate, on the quality of generated images. Image outputs were assessed using both standard generative metrics, such as Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and domain-specific metrics, including porosity, pore count, and pore area distributions. The optimised LoRA-enhanced diffusion model achieved a 92.6 % reduction in KID relative to baseline models, while also improving inference speed. Building on these advancements, this study demonstrates that the LoRA-enhanced diffusion model significantly improves neural network extrapolation in incomplete data scenarios through statistically consistent synthetic generation. Despite control challenges, this approach reduces costs and enables diverse applications, bridging fundamental rock physics with practical energy research.}

abstract = {Metabolic derangements, particularly obesity and post-transplant diabetes mellitus, remain major challenges in solid organ transplantation, contributing to graft dysfunction and increased morbidity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as promising agents due to their glucose-lowering, weight-reducing, and cardiorenal protective effects. Accumulating evidence supports their efficacy in improving glycemic control, reducing body weight, and potentially enhancing graft and patient survival across diverse transplant populations. Notably, GLP-1RAs exhibit a favorable safety profile, with minimal risk of drug interactions or rejection. Early data also suggest immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits. Moreover, newer dual and triple incretin agonists offer enhanced metabolic efficacy, potentially extending these benefits further. While long-term outcomes remain under investigation, GLP-1RAs represent a compelling therapeutic option that may reshape metabolic management paradigms in both pre- and post-transplant care.}

abstract = {With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, there is a growing demand for sophisticated and powerful chips. The adoption of these processors, along with increased power and bandwidth, highlights the necessity for efficient thermal management solutions. In this context, advanced two-phase thermal management systems have emerged as promising solutions. This study introduces a novel direct-to-chip evaporative cooling (DCEC) device that uses hollow micropillars integrated with a liquid delivery system to enable microscale evaporation of water and dielectric coolants in a fully actively pumped system. The device can operate in different evaporative regimes, characterized by a concave meniscus inside the micropillar’s hole or a droplet confined at the inner or outer edge of the micropillar, depending on the heating power, thermophysical properties of the coolant, and operating pressure. To characterize the heat transfer performance of the DCEC, we conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis, varying different operating and design parameters for water, R-1336mzz(Z), and Opteon™ 2P50. Our numerical results demonstrate device-level heat fluxes of 575 W/cm2, 413 W/cm2, and 365 W/cm2 for water, R-1336mzz(Z), and Opteon™ 2P50, respectively. The corresponding heat transfer coefficients are 2.88 × 105 W/m2 K, 2.07 × 105 W/m2 K, and 1.83 × 105 W/m2 K for water, R-1336mzz(Z), and Opteon™ 2P50, respectively. We also examine the performance of the device across various operating regimes. The results show that the device achieves 1.33× and 3.1× greater heat flux when a droplet is suspended at the outer edge of the hollow micropillar, compared to the stages with a concave or convex meniscus inside the micropillar’s hole. We here conduct a detailed pressure analysis to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of the device and determine the required inlet pressure for different coolants, operating regimes, and heat loads. These inlet pressure conditions can be integrated into the design of a feedback loop system to mitigate system failures caused by flooding or dryout.}

Results indicated that greater brain reserve at age 56 was associated with better concurrent executive function (r=.10, p=.040) and less decline in executive function over 12 years (r=.34, p=.001). These associations were not moderated by cognitive reserve or APOE genotype. Twin analysis suggested associations with executive function slopes were driven by genetic influences. Our findings suggest that greater brain reserve allowed for better cognitive maintenance from middle- to old age, driven by a genetic association. The results are consistent with differential preservation of executive function based on brain reserve that is independent of young adult cognitive reserve or APOE genotype.}

Based on the mobile app data, a GIS automated regionalization method is used to define regions of various urbanicity levels. The variability of HFMD patients’ travel behaviors across these regions are examined by the complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs). The travel burden in Nanchang increased as the patients’ residences moved toward regions of more rurality. Specifically, more urbanized regions near the city center (i.e., urban core and its surrounding urban) enjoyed better access to the healthcare service by spending an average of about 17-minute drive time. Patients residing in less urbanized regions such as suburbs and downtowns of surrounding rural counties either chose a nearby hospital or journeyed far to the region’s central Children’s Hospital, with average elevated travel time of 25 and 22 min, respectively. Those in rural areas travelled an average of 36 min, the longest among all regions. The study also finds a unique dual-peak pattern across two travel ranges in the study area due to the patients’ dilemma between pursuing high-quality hospitals and accommodating travel burden. Such a pattern mandates the adoption of a segmented regression approach to deriving the best-fitting CCDFs in most regions except for the rural.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Chinese medicine injections (CMIs) in treating diabetic lower extremity arterial disease (Dia-LEAD). However, with the variety of CMIs available, it has become challenging to determine the optimal choice for Dia-LEAD patients. This study aims to compare and rank the efficacy of CMIs for Dia-LEAD to provide references and evidence for clinicians in optimising drug selection.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CMIs for treating Dia-LEAD, which included the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, China Weipu Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science, covering inception to 15 October 2023. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 to assess bias risk, and RevMan 5.4.1, GeMTC, STATA 13.0, and R 4.2.1 for statistical analysis and visualization of the network meta-analysis.
Results
We analysed 38 studies with 12 CMIs. Compared with other interventions, Shuxuening injection (SXN) + conventional treatment (CT) was superior in terms of the total effective rate (surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) 86.2 %). Danshen injection (DS) + CT ranked first in improving the ankle-brachial index (ABI) (SUCRA 95.1 %) and dorsalis pedis artery blood flow (DPABF) (SUCRA 88.8 %). Danhong injection (DH) + CT showed the highest probability of effectiveness in improving the plasma viscosity (SUCRA 91.6 %). Chuanxiongqin injection (CXQ) + CT yielded favourable results in regulating fibrinogen levels (SUCRA 77.1 %). Furthermore, no significant differences in adverse reactions were detected between the treatment and control groups.
Conclusion
The study demonstrated that CMIs have potential as a complementary therapy for treating Dia-LEAD, and it supports the positive effects of combining CMIs with CT on a number of outcome indicators. Especially when it comes to improving the haemodynamics indices and the haemorheology indices, DS in combination with CT may be a more effective intervention. However, further confirmation in more rigorous, high-quality, and multicentre RCTs is needed to strengthen the validity and generalisability of the results.}

It is well established that the level of acceptance of these materials influences learning outcomes, but there is lack of evidence regarding the use and related impact of videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) on these aspects. This paper used linear mixed models and path analysis to investigate the influence of student acceptance of AI-generated short videos on learning outcomes compared to paper-based materials. Student acceptance was assessed based on perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), attitude (A), intentions (I), and concentration (C). The results indicate that both AI-generated short videos and paper-based materials can significantly enhance learning outcomes. AI-generated short videos are more likely to be accepted by students with lower pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at higher levels. On the other hand, paper-based materials are more likely to be accepted by students with higher pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at lower levels. These findings offer empirical evidence supporting the use of AI-generated short videos in FLL and provide suggestions for selecting appropriate learning materials in different FLL contexts.}

Thereafter, all specimens were processed for cryopreservation and were stored in liquid nitrogen (-196 °C) for 12 months before post-thaw sperm criteria were analyzed by a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system. Integrity of sperm DNA post thawing was visualized in all semen groups by fluorescence imaging, and in vitro fertilization ability of spermatozoa was also determined. Inclusion of L-carnitine or moringa leaves extract into the diluent improved (P<0.05) post-thaw sperm physical, morphofunctional and kinematic attributes, whilst maintaining (P<0.05) integrity of sperm DNA throughout the freezing and thawing cycle. Consequently, both supplemented groups yielded higher (P<0.05) in vitro fertilization rates compared to control. These results accentuate the protective roles of these antioxidants on buck sperm against consequences of cryopreservation-induced oxidative stress, hence ameliorating post-thaw sperm quality and fertilization competence. This is crucial for successful application of AI and IVF in goat selective breeding programs.}

Despite efforts to utilize street view imagery (SVI) for auditing perceived safety in urban areas, most studies remain analytical, with limited integration into urban design's form-based ideation workflow. The reason is mechanism dependency: few designers use both analytics (Python) and form-based design (Rhino) tools fluently. The outcome should not be overlooked: when the humanistic pedestrian experience cannot be explicitly integrated into the design process, the planning results may further marginalise disadvantaged groups. To bridge the gap between urban analytics and design, we propose a computational framework that automates the evaluation of pedestrian-oriented perceived safety in real-time, linking form-based urban design features, particularly greenery, to visual safety perception within urban canyons. By integrating datasets such as Place Pulse 2.0 and environmental attributes, the perceived safety of different urban canyons with varying urban forms and streetscape configurations can be seamlessly updated using machine learning in Rhino Grasshopper. Our tests show that in areas with the same urban density and height-width ratio, specific greenery configurations, such as tree density and green coverage, significantly improve perceived safety. Subsequently, urban canyon forms are categorised based on perceived safety outcomes to provide urban design guidelines. Notably, real-time visualisations from Stable Diffusion are further incorporated to improve the Rhino-based framework's usability in real life. This computational framework integrates visual perceptions into form-based urban form ideation (especially greenery characteristics): it alleviates the politics of difference in urban design practice, supporting the facilitation of more inclusive public spaces.}

For this purpose, we employed 4 groups of rats, 2 male and 2 female groups, chronically treated with saline or nicotine 3 mg/kg i.p. for 30 days, spanning from postnatal day 30 to postnatal day 60. Utilizing quantitative analyses and T-pattern detection and analysis, our findings revealed a complex and multifaceted behavioral reorganization in adolescent rats subjected to chronic nicotine administration. Specifically, we observed an increase of anxiety in males and a reduction in females. The distinctive structural changes, induced by chronic nicotine in both sexes, have significant implications, from a translational perspective, for studies on nicotine dependence disorders.}

abstract = {Background
Brief psychosocial interventions, such as the Healthy Activity Program (HAP), which are based on behavioral activation and delivered by nonspecialist providers (NSPs), have emerged as cost-effective solutions for the treatment of depression. HAP treatment outcomes are improved by the engagement of patients in activation-focused homework assignments and their adherence to these assignments during therapy. Currently, patients are expected to complete these homework assignments using a paper workbook.
Objective
The aim of this study was to describe the user-centered development process of PracticePal, a chatbot designed to enhance patient engagement and homework adherence, and to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability as a therapy aid in India.
Methods
We used a user-centered approach to co-develop PracticePal, incorporating conversational flows and video scripts in Hindi. The chatbot was piloted with 30 participants having depression who were receiving the HAP from 15 nonspecialist counselors in primary care in rural Madhya Pradesh, India. The feasibility and acceptability of PracticePal were assessed through engagement data, in-depth interviews with a subset of 6 participants, and focus group discussions with 11 counselors. Treatment completion rates and changes in depressive symptoms were explored as secondary outcomes.
Results
Average patient engagement spanned 29 days (95% CI 24-34) during the 60-day treatment period. The engagement of patients with PracticePal increased as their treatment progressed, particularly after the third HAP session. Of the 30 patients, 20 (67%) accessed more than half of the multimedia content available on the chatbot. On average, there was a greater frequency of self-initiated engagement (1558 out of a total of 1835 times, 84.9%) across all sessions compared with reminder prompts (277 out of 1835 times, 15.1%). All 30 patients completed treatment and experienced a reduction in the mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score from 13 (95% CI 12.6-13.6; signifying moderate severity) to 4 (95% CI 2.9-4.7; signifying none/minimal severity). Patients found the chatbot’s reminders for activities, mood tracking, and video messages helpful and observed that it could help others in their social network. NSPs also reported improved participation of patients in the homework tasks compared with the paper workbook. A few patients faced challenges with low internet bandwidth, and those with limited literacy suggested increasing the amount of video content for easier accessibility.
Conclusions
The PracticePal chatbot is a feasible and acceptable therapy aid to complement a psychological treatment, with promising potential to enhance the effectiveness of NSP-delivered psychosocial interventions in low-resource settings. Future steps include conducting a fully powered randomized controlled trial to assess its effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes.}

abstract = {Purpose
Tracheostomy care is supply- and resource-intensive, and airway-related adverse events in community settings have high rates of readmission and mortality. Devices are often implicated in harm, but little is known about insurance coverage, gaps, and barriers to obtaining tracheostomy-related medically necessary durable medical equipment. We aimed to identify barriers patients may encounter in procuring tracheostomy-related durable medical equipment through insurance plan coverage.
Materials and methods
Tracheostomy-related durable medical equipment provisions were evaluated across insurers, extracting data via structured telephone interviews and web-based searches. Each insurance company was contacted four times and queried iteratively regarding the range of coverage and co-pay policies. Outcome measures include call duration, consistency of explanation of benefits, and the number of transfers and disconnects. We also identified six qualitative themes from patient interviews.
Results
Tracheostomy-related durable medical equipment coverage was offered in some form by 98.1 % (53/54) of plans across 11 insurers studied. Co-pays or deductibles were required in 42.6 % (23/54). There was significant variability in out-of-pocket expenditures. Fixed co-pays ranged from $0–30, and floating co-pays ranged from 0 to 40 %. During phone interviews, mean call duration was 19 ± 10 min, with an average of 2 ± 1 transfers between agents. Repeated calls revealed high information variability (mean score 2.4 ± 1.5). Insurance sites proved challenging to navigate, scoring poorly on usability, literacy, and information quality.
Conclusions
Several factors may limit access to potentially life-saving durable medical equipment for patients with tracheostomy. Barriers include out-of-pocket expenditures, lack of transparency on coverage, and low-quality information. Further research is necessary to evaluate patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Peanut production in Argentina is predominantly rainfed, with considerable variability in rainfall patterns within and between seasons. This variability results in droughts of varying duration and severity, which can significantly reduce yields. Water availability is, therefore, a critical factor in determining the optimal sowing date. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the effects of sowing dates and water gradients on peanut yield and crop traits at two representative sites in the central peanut-producing region, and (ii) identify management strategies that optimize yield under water-limited conditions. Seasonal and annual analyses were conducted, incorporating water availability at sowing, environmental conditions, site characteristics, management practices, and cultivars. The Cropping System Model CROPGRO-Peanut was employed to simulate the impacts of those factors. Seasonal analysis revealed that delayed sowing dates consistently led to yield reductions, irrespective of water availability, with decreases in seed number, maximum leaf area index, total biomass, and water use efficiency. These yield reductions were more pronounced under lower water availability at sowing. When sown late, annual analysis indicated that combining an early cultivar and progressively narrowing row spacing resulted in increased yields. In contrast, intermediate-cycle and late cultivars experienced yield declines due to lower radiation and temperature levels. Differences in yield were also explained by the varying contributions of transpiration and evaporation to total water use. Our findings underscore the importance of management decisions in influencing water use components, with soil water-holding capacity playing a key role in crop performance. This study provides valuable insights for developing adapted management practices to improve productivity in temperate regions under water-limited conditions.}

The study formulated a research model grounded in Expectation Confirmation Theory, specifically examining the role of e-commerce experience in customer satisfaction and loyalty within the context of Pinduoduo. Hypothesized relationships were established between the core dimensions of e-commerce experience and the e-commerce customer engagement triad. To analyze the gathered data and evaluate the research hypotheses, structural equation modeling was employed. The research findings indicate that the core dimensions of e-commerce experience, namely e-commerce user interface quality, information quality, security risk avoidance perception, and privacy perception, exert positive influences on both customer satisfaction and trust. Moreover, the study reveals a positive relationship between customer satisfaction, trust, and customer loyalty. These findings have significant implications for e-commerce platform operators, highlighting the importance of enhancing customer experiences and building stronger customer relationships through targeted improvements in these critical factors.}

abstract = {Background
Stigma associated with HIV/AIDS continues to be a major barrier to prevention, management, and care. HIV stigma can negatively influence health behaviors. Surveys of the general public in Japan also demonstrated substantial gaps in knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Tweets from the social networking service X (formerly known as Twitter) have been studied to identify stigmas in other disorders but have not yet been used to study HIV stigma in Japan.
Objective
The aim of the study is to examine the variations in stigma related to HIV over an extended period using tweets from X and to investigate the stigma toward people with HIV associated with various demographic segments.
Methods
Japanese tweets from X related to HIV/AIDS were retrospectively collected; the phase 1 feasibility study collected tweets from 2011, 2014, and 2017, and the phase 2 analysis included tweets from each third year from 2011 through 2023. Individual tweets were labeled with the messages they conveyed (stigma and corresponding antistigma types included labels, marks, responsibility, peril, insults, and fear; tweets without stigma or antistigma messages were considered general education or neutral) along with demographic characteristics and locations; phase 1 results were used to develop a machine learning model to apply in phase 2. The labeled data from phase 2 were used to answer research questions concerning yearly changes in HIV stigma and proportions of stigma across population segments.
Results
A total of 2,016,826 tweets related to HIV/AIDS were identified over the study period; 1,648,556 (81.7%) were from individual accounts, with the remainder from organizational accounts. In total, 574,687 (28.5%) tweets indicated stigma attitudes, while 1,119,852 (55.5%), 207,320 (10.3%), and 114,967 (5.7%) showed neutral, antistigma, or general education attitudes, respectively. Tweets including peril, fear, or insult comprised 502,134 (87.4%) of tweets with stigma. The greatest numbers of tweets were made by people in their 20s, whereas people in their 20s and 60s had the greatest proportions of tweets with stigma (n=9650, 35.3% and n=558, 34.5%, respectively). Peril and fear made up 5819 (60.3%) of stigma tweets from people in their 20s. The proportion of tweets with stigma (n=59,719, 20.5% in 2017) increased notably during the COVID-19 pandemic (n=217,512, 31.4% in 2020, and a similar n=175,647, 33.9% in 2023). Tweets from health care practitioners had 1.68 times the odds of having antistigma messages versus those from others.
Conclusions
This study contributes to the understanding of HIV stigma in Japan and shows the usefulness of social media for studying stigma. The extent and type of HIV stigma changed from before to after the COVID-19 pandemic. These results can be used to develop future activities and educational programs to combat HIV-related stigma.}

abstract = {Both increased plant density and wide seedling strip planting (WSP) can improve wheat grain yield. However, whether and how greater gains in grain yield can be achieved by combining WSP with an increased plant density is unclear. In this study, two winter wheat cultivars were subjected to three plant densities (lower, normal, and higher) and two planting patterns (conventional planting [CP] and WSP). The effects of plant density, planting pattern, and their combination on the solar radiation interception and conversion, biomass accumulation, harvest index, and grain yield were investigated. In response to an increase in plant density from lower to higher and a shift from CP to WSP and their combination, grain yield increased by 15.43 %, 10.85 % and 27.62 % for cultivar Taimai198, and by 13.13 %, 8.31 % and 22.41 % for Shannong30, respectively. The larger increases in grain yield were mainly ascribed to enhanced dry matter production, in particular after anthesis with no variation or a slight decline in the harvest index. The higher plant density was the dominant driver of the enhanced radiation interception, whereas WSP was mainly responsible for ameliorating the reduction in radiation use efficiency (RUE) caused by the higher plant density. The combined effects of these two management practices in increasing grain yield were much greater than the independent effects of a shift from CP to WSP or an increase in plant density. Optimizing the planting method may thus be a promising option for further improving grain yield of a densely planted wheat population by increasing the RUE.}

A rarely discussed phenomenon, though gaining importance considering the increasing number of real-life use cases, is using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. By manipulating visualizations, artificial intelligence (AI) allows politicians to eliminate or minimize the deficits of their performance and highlight or create features perceived as attractive by the audience. Such manipulations pose a significant epistemic problem, and can severely distort perception of real politicians and their characteristics. These disruptions might correspond to the classic “Ship of Theseus” paradox that addresses the problem of changing identity. The aim of this study is to analyze how this philosophical conundrum could be used for crafting better transparency obligations (disclaimers) for using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. The aim of such disclaimers is to sensitize and protect public opinion against manipulation. However, at the moment the basic labels concentrate on technological dimension of manipulation, overlooking cognitive consequences for human audiences. This paper proposes extensive disclaimers to strengthen their informative and sensitizing potential.}

abstract = {With the ongoing climate warming, recurrent extreme rainfall events have become a pervasive global challenge. The integration of disaster warnings with precipitation nowcasting can effectively mitigate both human casualties and economic losses. Currently, deep learning techniques are widely employed for radar echo extrapolation as a primary approach to precipitation nowcasting. However, the lack of physical constraints often leads to blurriness in predicted images as the forecast time increases, ultimately resulting in a decline in forecast quality. In this study, we proposed an evolution network that incorporates Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to extract physical motion information and enhance the network’s ability to learn such information. The results demonstrated that employing convolutional KANs (ConvKANs) as the fundamental module significantly reduced the number of model parameters while achieving superior performance. ConvKAN proved to be a highly effective foundational module for the evolution network, not only substantially reducing the number of model parameters and effectively improving specific meteorological metrics (CSI, POD) and the clarity metric of predicted images (Tenengrad), but also achieving the best performance in precipitation forecasting. Notably, our CUX2&evOnet (K2) model combining convolutional modules exhibited optimal performance. Compared to the CNN-based model named CUX2&evOnet(C32), it improved CSI, POD, and Tenengrad by 2.02%, 5.17%, and 2.52%, respectively, while requiring only 2.37% of its evolution network parameters. These findings confirm that deep learning models driven by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT) exhibit enhanced proficiency in precipitation nowcasting.}

Nevertheless, two drawbacks as for the optical probes for H2S detection, taking about a long time to reach the optical signal balance or the low selectivity, always exist. Herein, by using a highly photoluminescent and H2S-stimuli responsive silver-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs): Ag-BDC (BDC = 1, 4-benzene dicarboxylate), we demonstrated that the luminescence intensity of Ag-BDC MOFs was inversely proportional to the concentration of H2S due to the Ag–S coordination and the obstruction of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition process, and there was a quick response time of below 3.0 min. Combined with a simple customized device to separate H2S from the sample, the selectivity of the method for H2S detection could be greatly improved, and no interference would be caused even if the other sulfur-containing species coexisted. The luminescence probe presented a favorable sensitivity within a linear range of 0.1–1000 μM along with a detection limit of 23.7 nM. When employed to assay the endogenous sulfide level in the human serum and mouse brain tissue, the approach showed recoveries from 96.3% to 102% with relative standard derivation (RSD) less than 2.0%. By the integration of the responsive luminescent silver-based MOFs with a simple self-assembled headspace separation device, obviously the present strategy could be beneficial to the development and design of the in-field fast H2S measurement, possessing particular advantages in biological systems to eliminate the potential interferences.}

Teachers’ information-based teaching ability has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving the digital transformation of education, particularly in computer science and modern pedagogical approaches. Grounded in the Quality Matters (QM) online course quality standards, this study developed a comprehensive index system for evaluating teachers’ information-based teaching competencies using advanced methods such as factor analysis, index extraction, and divergence analysis. The findings reveal that the evaluation ability of information-based teaching has a positive impact on the design ability of information-based teaching objectives, the provision ability of information-based teaching resources, the organization ability of information-based teaching activities, and the guidance ability of information-based teaching, and the path coefficients are 0.86, 0.60, 0.36, and 0.45, respectively. Teachers’ platform resource integration ability has a positive impact on information-based teaching evaluation ability, information-based teaching tool application ability, and information-based teaching activity organization ability, and the path coefficients are 0.45, 0.71, and 0.39, respectively; Teachers’ organization ability of information-based teaching activities has a positive impact on information-based teaching guidance ability, and the path coefficient is 0.39. The ability of teachers to use information-based teaching tools has a positive impact on the organization ability of information-based teaching activities, and the path coefficient is 0.25. The ability to provide information teaching resources and the ability to apply information teaching tools have a positive impact on each other, and the path coefficients are 0.43 and 0.49, respectively. These seven dimensions have constructed the model of teachers' online teaching ability, and proposed the ways to improve teachers' online teaching ability based on the current situation of teachers' online teaching ability.}

The results showed that the accumulation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and benzene in the soil of the directly contaminated area significantly reshaped the microbial community structure (p < 0.05), and petroleum-degrading bacteria, such as Alphaproteobacteria, were distributed at all stages of petroleum degradation, with the greatest concentration during the early stage of degradation. The random forest model identified Ralstonia and soil moisture content as the driving factors of L-isoleucine biosynthesis II, and revealed that Brevundimonas and Hydrogenophaga exerted antagonistic effects on the 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis I (AIR) pathway individually while synergistically enhancing its activity. Microbial network analysis showed that the direct impact zone microorganisms constructed a highly robust degradation network by strengthening core pathways such as fatty acid metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and its functional diversity significantly enhanced network stability and the environmental buffering capacity. This study provides an important theoretical basis for the mining of functional flora and optimization of ecological remediation strategies in oil-polluted areas.}

As these vehicles become more interconnected, the risk of their components being affected by anomalies or intentional malicious attacks grows. It is essential, therefore, to identify and filter out any anomalous data to ensure reliable decision-making. Existing solutions for anomaly detection in CVs include methods such as kalman filter, cumulative summation, convolutional neural networks and other machine learning models. However, a prevalent issue is the limited universality of anomaly datasets along with the variability introduced by simulated data. Additionally, there are few methods for recovering the network from anomalies using sensor information. In this paper, we address these limitations by utilizing the Tampa CV (TCV) dataset and incorporating anomalies such as bias, noise, and spikes. Furthermore, we present a novel method for real-time anomaly detection in CVs using Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD). We propose a unique recovery mechanism that employs Bayesian forecasting to interpret identified anomalies, marking the first of its kind in this field. This approach significantly enhances the security of CV systems by seamlessly merging instant detection with swift recovery, ensuring continuous protection against data integrity threats. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an average accuracy improvement of 53.83 % over other machine learning models. This paper makes advancement through real-time anomaly detection and recovery mechanisms, thus significantly improving the resilience of smart transportation systems against data integrity threats.}

Among these, the NLRP3 inflammasome has emerged as a crucial mediator linking hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation to vascular dysfunction. Dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production further exacerbate plaque formation and cardiovascular complications. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) highlight the cardioprotective benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), while novel anti-inflammatory strategies, including IL-1β inhibition and NLRP3-targeting agents, offer promising therapeutic avenues. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic atherosclerosis, with a unique emphasis on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in disease progression and how targeted interventions including SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and emerging NLRP3-modulating agents can be integrated with precision medicine strategies. Unlike existing reviews, we highlight how genomic, epigenetic, and phenotypic stratification can guide combination therapies to optimize cardiovascular protection. Integrating individualized anti-inflammatory and metabolic interventions may provide tailored cardiovascular care, reducing morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Future research should focus on refining these personalized approaches to mitigate diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications.}

abstract = {Background
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generate human-like text. One potential application of this capability is using LLMs to simulate clients in a mental health context. This research presents the development and evaluation of Client101, a web conversational platform featuring LLM-driven chatbots designed to simulate mental health clients.
Objective
We aim to develop and test a web-based conversational psychotherapy training tool designed to closely resemble clients with mental health issues.
Methods
We used GPT-4 and prompt engineering techniques to develop chatbots that simulate realistic client conversations. Two chatbots were created based on clinical vignette cases: one representing a person with depression and the other, a person with generalized anxiety disorder. A total of 16 mental health professionals were instructed to conduct single sessions with the chatbots using a cognitive behavioral therapy framework; a total of 15 sessions with the anxiety chatbot and 14 with the depression chatbot were completed. After each session, participants completed a 19-question survey assessing the chatbot’s ability to simulate the mental health condition and its potential as a training tool. Additionally, we used the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) tool to analyze the psycholinguistic features of the chatbot conversations related to anxiety and depression. These features were compared to those in a set of webchat psychotherapy sessions with human clients—42 sessions related to anxiety and 47 related to depression—using an independent samples t test.
Results
Participants’ survey responses were predominantly positive regarding the chatbots’ realism and portrayal of mental health conditions. For instance, 93% (14/15) considered that the chatbot provided a coherent and convincing narrative typical of someone with an anxiety condition. The statistical analysis of LIWC psycholinguistic features revealed significant differences between chatbot and human therapy transcripts for 3 of 8 anxiety-related features: negations (t56=4.03, P=.001), family (t56=–8.62, P=.001), and negative emotions (t56=–3.91, P=.002). The remaining 5 features—sadness, personal pronouns, present focus, social, and anger—did not show significant differences. For depression-related features, 4 of 9 showed significant differences: negative emotions (t60=–3.84, P=.003), feeling (t60=–6.40, P<.001), health (t60=–4.13, P=.001), and illness (t60=–5.52, P<.001). The other 5 features—sadness, anxiety, mental, first-person pronouns, and discrepancy—did not show statistically significant differences.
Conclusions
This research underscores both the strengths and limitations of using GPT-4-powered chatbots as tools for psychotherapy training. Participant feedback suggests that the chatbots effectively portray mental health conditions and are generally perceived as valuable training aids. However, differences in specific psycholinguistic features suggest targeted areas for enhancement, helping refine Client101’s effectiveness as a tool for training mental health professionals.}

This paper examines the impact of future climate changes on an urban watershed in southern California using an integrated hydrologic model. GSFLOW modeling software is used to simulate the nonlinear relationships between climate trends and precipitation partitioning into ET, runoff, and subsurface storage. Four global circulation models (GCMs), each with two greenhouse-gas scenarios, RCP45 and RCP85 are used to project future climate conditions. GCMs include the CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5 models. The model's simulated hydrologic conditions are compared with historical data to assess changes in water budgets and groundwater supply. Results indicate decreased groundwater storage in most scenarios due to increased natural evapotranspiration, vegetation consumptive use, and streamflow out of the watershed. Only scenarios with substantially increased future precipitation show increased groundwater storage. The study also highlights increased future aridity despite the rise in precipitation and large precipitation events forecast by GCMs, which increase the risk of urban floods and decrease stream leakage and water available to vegetation.}

Based on a primary survey of Indian MBA admission decision-makers, this study identifies nine key competencies, and their relative importance, that the MBA admission process in India assesses. A key finding of this study is that industry experts and academics disagree on the importance of six of these nine competencies, thus confirming a lack of alignment. MBA admission decision-makers also do not use specific and quantitative criteria while assessing most of these key competencies. For instance, 90% of respondents said they did not use specific and quantitative criteria for evaluating execution & digital competencies. Business schools should align admissions to assess required contemporary competencies effectively. Faculty may offer pedagogical intervention to boost competencies not assessed effectively during admissions.}

Medical interviewing is a critical skill in clinical practice, yet opportunities for practical training are limited in Japanese medical schools, necessitating urgent measures. Given advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its application in the medical field is expanding. However, reports on its application in medical interviews in medical education are scarce.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate whether medical students’ interview skills could be improved by engaging with AI-simulated patients using large language models, including the provision of feedback.
Methods
This nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted with fourth-year medical students in Japan. A simulation program using large language models was provided to 35 students in the intervention group in 2023, while 110 students from 2022 who did not participate in the intervention were selected as the control group. The primary outcome was the score on the Pre-Clinical Clerkship Objective Structured Clinical Examination (pre-CC OSCE), a national standardized clinical skills examination, in medical interviewing. Secondary outcomes included surveys such as the Simulation-Based Training Quality Assurance Tool (SBT-QA10), administered at the start and end of the study.
Results
The AI intervention group showed significantly higher scores on medical interviews than the control group (AI group vs control group: mean 28.1, SD 1.6 vs 27.1, SD 2.2; P=.01). There was a trend of inverse correlation between the SBT-QA10 and pre-CC OSCE scores (regression coefficient –2.0 to –2.1). No significant safety concerns were observed.
Conclusions
Education through medical interviews using AI-simulated patients has demonstrated safety and a certain level of educational effectiveness. However, at present, the educational effects of this platform on nonverbal communication skills are limited, suggesting that it should be used as a supplementary tool to traditional simulation education.}

Due to the limitations of unstructured or semi-structured text records, current hazardous chemical accident research heavily relies on expert evaluations, often resulting in inefficiency, lack of intelligence, and subjectivity. To overcome this limitation, we propose an accident analysis framework that combines deep learning-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) and topic mining algorithms. First, we employ a RoBERTa-BiLSTM-Attention-CRF method based on a pre-trained model to automatically recognize and extract information from accident reports according to predefined accident entities. Second, we construct a dictionary specific to the hazardous chemicals domain and apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to analyze the causes of accidents within the “CAUSE” entity, thereby deriving the hazardous themes implied in the accidents. Finally, we validate the model on a self-constructed hazardous chemical named entity recognition incident report dataset (HCNER). The research findings indicate that the methodology proposed in this study effectively addresses the challenges associated with dispersed textual information, specialized terminology, and data formatting in the digital processing of hazardous chemical incidents. This advancement propels the development within the domain of hazardous chemical safety management and serves as a viable approach for investigating the causes of such incidents.}

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).
Methods
This subanalysis of the Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Repair in Spain (TRI-SPA) registry included patients with at least severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) who were treated with T-TEER between June 2020 and May 2023 in Spain. Patients with CIEDs and no or mild tricuspid lead-leaflet interaction were compared with those without CIEDs.

Among 310 patients (mean age 75.5±9.1 years, 70% female) with significant TR treated with T-TEER, 35 (11%) had CIEDs. Device implantation success was high in both groups (97.1% in the CIED group vs 96.4% in the non-CIED group, P=.81), with a similar rate of ≤2+ residual TR (84.9% in the CIED group vs 91.0% in the non-CIED group, P=.26). Patients with CIEDs experienced comparable rates of the primary composite endpoint to the non-CIED group (23.8% vs 19.1%, respectively, HR, 1.40; 95%CI, 0.60-3.31; P=.44), sustained successful TR reduction (≤ 2+ in 55.0% vs 73.8%, P=.07), and functional improvement (NYHA class I/II 81.8% vs 79.9%, P=.79).
Conclusions
In a real-world setting, T-TEER seems to be an effective therapeutic option for selected patients with more than moderate TR and CIEDs with no or mild lead-leaflet interaction, offering comparable cardiovascular outcomes and clinical improvement to those without leads. However, the presence of CIEDs may represent an independent risk factor for TR recurrence.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Este estudio tiene como objetivo evaluar la efectividad y los resultados clínicos de la reparación percutánea de borde a borde de la válvula tricúspide (T-TEER) en pacientes con dispositivos cardiacos implantables (DCI).
Métodos
Este subanálisis del registro de reparación percutánea tricuspídea en España (TRI-SPA) incluye pacientes con insuficiencia tricuspídea (IT) al menos grave tratados con T-TEER entre junio de 2020 y mayo de 2023 en España. Se compararon los pacientes con DCI sin o con interacción leve entre el cable y la valva tricuspídea con aquellos sin DCI. El objetivo primario fue un compuesto de mortalidad por cualquier causa, hospitalización por insuficiencia cardiaca y reintervención sobre la válvula tricúspide a los 12 meses.
Resultados
De los 310 pacientes (edad media 75,5±9,1 años, 70% mujeres) con IT significativa tratados con T-TEER, 35 (11%) tenían DCI. La tasa de éxito del implante fue alta en ambos grupos (el 97,1% en el grupo con DCI frente al 96,4% en el grupo sin DCI; p=0,81), con una tasa similar de IT residual ≤2+ (el 84,9% en el grupo con DCI frente al 91,0% en el grupo sin DCI; p=0,26). Los pacientes con DCI presentaron tasas comparables del objetivo primario en comparación con el grupo sin DCI (el 23,8% frente a 19,1%, respectivamente; HR=1,40; IC95%, 0,60-3,31; p=0,44), con una reducción sostenida de la IT (≤ 2+ en 55,0% frente a 73,8%; p=0,07) y mejoría clínica (clase NYHA I/II 81,8% frente a 79,9%; p=0,79).
Conclusiones
En la práctica clínica real, la T-TEER parece ser una opción terapéutica efectiva para pacientes seleccionados con IT moderada o grave y DCI sin interacción o con interacción leve entre el cable y la válvula tricúspide, ofreciendo resultados cardiovasculares y mejoras clínicas comparables a aquellos sin dispositivos. La presencia de DCI puede representar un factor de riesgo independiente para la recurrencia de la IT.}

abstract = {Purpose
This research examines the complex relationship between usage of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) amongst student and their creativity, learning and assessment using empirical data collected from postgraduate students. In addition, the study explores the student’s intrinsic motivation for usage to understand student categories. This research seeks to provide further insights into this artificial intelligence tool in enhancing the educational ecosystem for all stakeholders concerned.
Design/methodology/approach
The target population of this research – the students of post-graduation in diverse fields of science and management. A five-point Likert scale-structured questionnaire adapted from earlier literature relevant to the research questions was adopted for data collection. The data were collected for two months, resulted in 403 usable responses. Ethical considerations of assurance of confidentiality to the participants were strictly adhered to. Structured equation modelling (SEM) was employed to explore the relationships between the constructs of the study for the assessment of latent relationships. SmartPLS 4 was used to explore these relationships.
Findings
Usage has a negative impact on a student’s creativity, but increased usage of ChatGPT encourages a student’s adoption due to its perceived usability. Pedagogical applications of ChatGPT aid students as a learning tool but require controlled usage under supervision.
Originality/value
This study is innovative in the context of postgraduate students, where very little evidence of creativity exists. Through this research, the authors illuminate how ChatGPT use affects academic performance, benefiting educators as a tool but for evaluation and assessment, policymakers and students. The findings of the study provide implications that help to create effective digital education strategies for stakeholders.}

Furthermore, the increasing pervasiveness of social media networks in our daily lives has facilitated the easy dissemination of fake news accompanied by such synthetic images. Hyper-realistic artificial face images are often illicitly used as profile pictures on social media sites, further using such profiles to spread fabricated information, resulting in social perils. Most available synthetic image detectors are challenging to implement in practical scenarios due to their high complexity and performance degradation for images from Online Social Networks (OSNs). In this work, we develop a deep learning-based lightweight synthetic image detector called Relative Chrominance Distance Network (RCD-Net). In this paper, we introduce the RCD image feature set for the first time, which gives a pair-wise chrominance component-based distance measure. To show its effectiveness, we explore multiple luminance-chrominance spaces. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA), our model hugely reduces the network parameter requirements, making it incredibly lightweight. We also study the robustness of the proposed solution against common post-processing operations in the context of online social media networks. Experimental results prove that the proposed solution achieves SOTA performance at a much lower complexity than available solutions.}

Existing UDA approaches highly depend on the accessibility of source domain data, which is usually limited in practical scenarios due to privacy protection, data storage and transmission cost, and computation burden. To tackle this issue, many source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) methods have been proposed recently, which perform knowledge transfer from a pre-trained source model to the unlabeled target domain with source data inaccessible. A comprehensive review of these works on SFUDA is of great significance. In this paper, we provide a timely and systematic literature review of existing SFUDA approaches from a technical perspective. Specifically, we categorize current SFUDA studies into two groups, i.e., white-box SFUDA and black-box SFUDA, and further divide them into finer subcategories based on different learning strategies they use. We also investigate the challenges of methods in each subcategory, discuss the advantages/disadvantages of white-box and black-box SFUDA methods, conclude the commonly used benchmark datasets, and summarize the popular techniques for improved generalizability of models learned without using source data. We finally discuss several promising future directions in this field.}

The rapid adoption of scientific foundation models and their use in AI agents is changing scientific practices and thereby impacting this epistemic fabric which hinges on trust and reliance. Foundation models are machine learning models that are trained on large bodies of data and can be applied to a multitude of tasks. Their application in science raises the question of whether scientific foundation models can be relied upon as a research tool and to what extent, or even be trusted as if they were research partners. Conceptual clarification of the notions of trust and reliance in science is pivotal in the face of foundation models. Trust and reliance form the glue for the increasingly distributed epistemic labour within contemporary technoscientific systems. We build on two concepts of trust in science, namely trust in science as shared values, and trust in science based on commitments to processes that provide objective claims. We analyse whether scientific foundation models are research tools to which the concept of reliance applies, or research partners that can be trustworthy or not. We consider these foundation models within their socio-technical contexts. Allocation of trust should be reserved for human agents and the organizations they operate in. Reliance applies to foundation models and artificial intelligence agents. This distinction is important to unambiguously allocate responsibility, which is crucial in maintaining the fabric of trust that underpins science.}

abstract = {Background
Stress is a key transdiagnostic factor in the onset and recurrence of psychiatric disorders. Virtual reality (VR) in mental health care, particularly virtual natural environments, shows promising results in promoting relaxation, as evidenced by tools such as VRelax. While initial studies have demonstrated the efficacy of VRelax, further implementation in routine mental health care requires a systematic exploration of its use by patients. Understanding these perspectives can help tailor VR tools to meet the needs of users better and enhance their effectiveness in clinical settings.
Objective
This study aims to identify patient-perceived barriers to and facilitators of using VR relaxation as a self-management relaxation tool to support its implementation in mental health care.
Methods
Four focus groups were conducted with 19 participants with a wide range of psychiatric problems, including burnout, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants were recruited via a network of people with lived experience, health care professionals, and social media. Semistructured interview guides with open-ended questions were used to investigate barriers and facilitators. People with psychiatric problems were instructed to use VRelax at home at least 3 times before the focus group discussions. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify barriers and facilitators.
Results
The focus group discussions generated 7 themes with various subthemes. The sense of autonomy was identified as a facilitator, indicating users’ experience of feeling in control and independent, which allowed them to manage and operate VRelax on their own. On the other hand, participants indicated that for optimal long-term use, there should be a balance between autonomy and structured guidance and integration into therapy. Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and immersive factors were identified as both barriers and facilitators. Participants had positive initial experiences with VRelax but also reported that the effects of virtual natural environments might diminish with continued use. Usefulness might vary by the phase of psychiatric problems and the individual’s momentary emotional state. Participants saw the plug-and-play design of VRelax as helpful but also indicated the importance of easy navigation within the program, including the ability to quickly find specific natural environments. Three barriers were identified: shortcomings in user guidance; perceived problems in transitioning back to reality; and physical hindrances, such as the discomfort caused by the VR glasses.
Conclusions
For optimal implementation of VR relaxation in mental health care, personalized VR experiences should be facilitated, such as offering a specific selection of virtual natural environments based on the momentary emotional state, while fostering user autonomy. Integration of VR tools into ongoing treatment is important, aligning with shared decision-making principles. In addition, reducing the steps required during the starting and the closing processes is crucial, alongside addressing challenges such as physical discomfort and inadequate instructions.}

abstract = {Background
To date, no direct comparisons have been performed to compare the effectiveness of all epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
Methods
We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing osimertinib, lazertinib, aumolertinib, befotertinib, furmonertinib, dacomitinib, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, and chemotherapy. Pooled estimations of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity (grade ≥ 3 adverse events) were performed within the Bayesian framework.
Results
Twenty-three trials involving 11 treatments were included. All EGFR-TKIs improved PFS relative to chemotherapy, except for icotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26–1.44). All EGFR-TKIs demonstrated significant ORR benefits over chemotherapy. Osimertinib seemed to prolong PFS compared with icotinib (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.1–0.86), gefitinib (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21–0.74), and erlotinib (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29–1.0). In addition, osimertinib showed favorable superiority in improving OS compared with chemotherapy (HR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.43–0.82), gefitinib (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45–0.83), erlotinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48–0.89), and afatinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44–0.94). Among these regimens, afatinib showed the highest ORR (cumulative probability: 96.96%). Icotinib was associated with minimal toxicity among the EGFR-TKIs, followed by furmonertinib and osimertinib. Moreover, the toxicity spectra differed among the EGFR-TKIs. Subgroup analyses of patients with two common types of EGFR mutations indicated that furmonertinib possessed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with exon 19 deletion, and lazertinib showed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with Leu858Arg mutation. We also identified differences between EGFR-TKIs in prolonging PFS in patients with brain metastasis.
Conclusions
Osimertinib is the first choice of treatment with considerable efficacy and safety for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The treatments associated with the best PFS in patients with exon 19 deletions and Leu858Arg mutations were furmonertinib and lazertinib, respectively.}

Herein, thin-walled mortar specimens were subjected to dynamic torsional tests at varying rotational speeds using a large-scale torsional split Hopkinson tube. The dynamic shear stress–strain curves of mortar specimens were obtained at different strain rates, and the dynamic shear failure characteristics were examined. The dynamic shear strain rate effect in the specimens was found to be intermediate between the tensile and compressive strain rate effects. High-speed camera observations revealed three distinct stages of the dynamic torsional failure: initial oblique crack formation, sequential formation of multiple oblique cracks, and growth of these cracks along the specimen–tube interface, resulting in a ccumferential cross-sectional crack and specimen separation from the tube. The oblique cracks formed at an inclination of 30°–45° to the longitudinal axis, located between the directions of the maximum tensile and shear stresses. Under various strain rates, numerical simulations and experiments revealed comparable rising portions of shear stress-strain curves and specimen shear strengths. However, the curve descending sections and many oblique cracks (45° to the longitudinal axis) that were uniformly formed in the middle of the specimens differed from the experimental results due to varying friction levels and specimen inhomogeneity. This work provides important information for understanding the shear mechanisms of building materials and structures under dynamic loads.}

PSs with two different functional groups, sulfate (iota (IC), lambda (LC), and kappa (KC) carrageenan) and carboxylate (low methoxyl pectin (LMP) and sodium alginate (SA)) were investigated. The optimized conditions for coacervation and activity recovery were pH 4 with a phytase-to-polysaccharide volume ratio of 12:1. Zeta potential measurements, FTIR spectroscopy, and molecular docking confirmed that electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were the main driving forces for coacervate formation. Coacervate complexes of phytase formed with LMP, SA, or KC showed a high activity retention after immobilization, with approximately 30% yield of complex and 75% immobilization efficiency of the phytase. The lower enzyme activity retention observed for IC and LC complexes is attributed to these PSs binding to the enzyme's active site. Overall, this work contributes to the body of knowledge about intermolecular interactions between phytase and polysaccharides and can serve as a guide to formulating stable, functional ingredients for a plant-based diet.}

abstract = {Summary
Background and aims
Intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) is a safe and effective patient-tailored nutritional strategy for providing nutrient supplementation to malnourished or at risk of malnutrition patients on hemodialysis (HD), who did not adequately respond to intensive dietary counselling and oral nutritional supplementation. Although IDPN is recommended by current ESPEN and KDOQI guidelines for nutrition in HD patients, none of these documents informs how to successfully implement this therapy, being the lack of knowledge on practical aspects of IDPN one of the main limitations to its use. The aim of this narrative review was to provide a practical roadmap for guiding the nephrologists, dietitians, and renal nurses in their everyday clinical practice about the use of IDPN.
Methods
A multidisciplinary group formed by specialists from the areas of Nephrology and Nutrition agreed to address different practical aspects related to IDPN in HD patients. Based on the available evidence in the literature and on the authors' clinical experience, different topics were selected to develop a detailed plan for implementing a successful experience with IDPN, proposing a practical IDPN roadmap.
Results
This IDPN roadmap provides practical information on when an IDPN should be started; what type of nutrients should be part of an IDPN; how the IDPN should be administered; how the effectiveness and safety of the IDPN should be monitored; how to determine the effectiveness of IDPN; and the conditions that advise discontinuing the IDPN.
Conclusions
IDPN is a safe and effective nutritional therapy for HD patients, although the lack of staff training may limit its use. This review addresses different practical aspects of IDPN, helping interdisciplinary teams in their daily clinical practice to improve the nutritional care of HD patients, either malnourished or at risk of malnutrition.}

abstract = {The application of sewage sludge compost (SSC) for abandoned mine land reclamation represents a nature-based solution. As the core medium of soil nutrient cycling, the characteristics and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are critical indicators reflecting the efficacy of mine land restoration. This study investigated long-term SSC effects on DOM transformation in mine topsoil via large-scale field experiments. SSC application improved topsoil fertility and plant growth, boosting plant-derived organic inputs that enhanced DOM molecular diversity and richness. Under SSC application, the introduction of Chloroflexi as a dominant phylum promoted microbial co-utilization of labile/recalcitrant carbon, increasing organic decomposition and biosynthesis functional gene abundance. For application rates, 30 t/ha delivered fewer nutrients than 120 t/ha, slowing humification processes, while 225 t/ha caused nitrogen overload, worsening runoff-mediated losses. For application methods, spreading application concentrated nutrients in subsurface layers, intensifying plant-microbe nitrogen competition and decoupling of microbial catabolic-anabolic metabolisms under nitrogen limitation. Consequently, SSC mixing application at 120 t/ha emerged as the optimal strategy for balancing carbon‑nitrogen allocation, enhancing organic matter accumulation and stability. Over three years, the aromaticity of M120 topsoil DOM progressively increased, achieving a dynamic equilibrium among DOM input, decomposition, and stabilization through plant-microbe synergy. Overall, this study provides theoretical foundations for applying SSC to enhance soil carbon sequestration and sustainable nutrient management in abandoned mine land reclamation.}

In addition, the multilayer structures exhibit a critical current density (CCD) of 2.5 mA cm−2 at room temperature and are stable over 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 in symmetric Li cells. Overall, this work offers guidance for the scalable production of thin LLZO ceramics with enhanced physical and electrochemical properties.}

We first outline critiques of translanguaging, most particularly the issue of deconstructivism and concerns about transformative limitations. We then focus on the potential of translanguaging as a conceptual frame for how language mediates learning in the context of social inequity (schools). We primarily draw on Bakhtin's (1981) theorisation of language and Bourdieu's (1991) understanding of the relationship between language and symbolic power to suggest that taking sociohistorical context as central to translanguaging can help us to move beyond ‘internal’ structuralist debates and open up productive lines of inquiry at the intersection of language and learning.}

Recruitment issues are the most common reason for the discontinuation of clinical trials. Nurses often play an integral role in the recruitment process, yet the advantages and challenges associated with employing nurses for recruitment and eligibility screening have not been well examined. This study explores the experiences, advantages, and challenges of entrusting family nurses with the dual responsibilities of screening, recruiting, and following up with participants in the Norwegian Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) trial.
Methods
We draw on survey data (n = 28) and qualitative interview data from structured focus group interviews (n = 29) with family nurses operating in five distinct Norwegian trial regions.
Results
The results suggest that one of the primary advantages of having family nurses conduct recruitment and screening in the NFP trial is their clinical expertise and ability to attend to underserved participants during the screening process. However, family nurses found the duality of being both nurses and researchers complex and, at times, challenging, primarily due to their strong belief in the intervention and the randomization of participants.
Discussion
The dual role of helper and researcher can often be challenging for nurses, yet their engagement can significantly impact the success of a trial. This study highlights some inherent challenges of conducting randomized-controlled trials in underserved populations and underscores the need for future research to explore facilitating factors for employing nurses in clinical trials.}

Nevertheless, finding the balance between the structure and properties of materials remains a significant challenge. In this work, cellulose-based epoxy (PHPCEP) with “soft” and “hard” cooperative structures was designed and demonstrated to endow bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) with excellent toughness, heat resistance, mechanical strength, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and solvent resistance. When 5 wt% PHPCEP was incorporated into BADGE composites, the resulting materials exhibited the maximum flexural strength (121.9 MPa) and tensile strength (71.4 MPa), a high glass transition temperature (148.3 °C), and 10 wt% PHPCEP/BADGE demonstrated the highest impact strength (70.5 kJ/m2). These figures are 18.8 %, 16.1 %, 21.5 %, and 254.3 % higher than the corresponding values of neat BADGE. The results of dynamic mechanical properties and heat degradation of the cured specimens also suggest that PHPCEP/BADGE materials have superior stiffness and toughness than neat BADGE, which could be attributed to the strong interaction between PHPCEP and BADGE, delivering better thermal stability for the composites compared to the pristine resin. Considering the remarkable effect, this work provides an effective way of highly efficient utilization of abundant cellulose and a high-performance additive for composite materials.}

Amid growing concern over children’s access to online pornography, policy makers are looking toward new and emerging technological concepts for unexplored solutions including artificial intelligence and facial recognition.
Objective
This study sought to explore and ideate emerging technological interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective in preventing and controlling the exposure of young people to online pornographic material.
Methods
We conducted a series of qualitative co-design workshops with both adult (n=8; aged 32-53 years) and adolescent participants (n=4; aged 15-17 years) to ideate potential technological interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective at preventing and controlling the exposure of young people to online pornographic material. A story stem methodology was used to explore participants’ attitudes toward two unique technological prototypes.
Results
Participants expressed a generally favorable view of the proposed technological concepts but remained unconvinced of their overall utility and effectiveness in preventing the intentional viewing of pornography by young people. Age-appropriate parent-child conversations remained participants’ preferred approach to mitigating potential harms from pornographic material, with parents also expressing a desire for more educational resources to help them better navigate these discussions. User privacy and data security were a primary concern for participants, particularly surrounding the use and collection of biometric data.
Conclusions
Internationally, policy makers are taking action to use age assurance technologies to prevent children’s access to online pornography. It is important to consider the needs and opinions of parents and young people in the use and implementation of these technologies. Participants in this study were generally supportive of new and emerging technologies as useful tools in preventing the accidental exposure of young people to online pornographic material. However, participants remained less convinced of their ability to avert intentional viewing, with substantial concerns regarding technological efficacy, adaptability, and user privacy. Further, co-design and prototype refinement are needed to better understand user acceptability and comfortability of these new technological interventions, alongside additional research exploring sociocultural differences in information needs and user experiences.}

Data were collected from 300 employees across four- and five-star hotels in southern India using purposive and snowball sampling, with both online and hard-copy standardized questionnaires measuring centralization, work locus of control, and bullying perceptions (work-related, person-related, and physically intimidating). Contrary to expectations, a higher hierarchy of authority was associated with reduced work-related bullying, suggesting that centralized structures may provide clarity and stability in India's cultural context. Also, greater participation in decision-making correlated with increased physically intimidating bullying, indicating potential interpersonal tensions during collaborative processes. Internal work locus of control moderated these relationships, with employees exhibiting higher internal locus perceiving less bullying, highlighting the role of individual agency in mitigating negative workplace dynamics. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about centralized authority's role in fostering bullying, particularly in Eastern settings, and underscore the moderating effect of internal locus of control. The study contributes to workplace bullying literature by offering insights into cultural and structural influences in the Indian hospitality sector. It provides practical implications for managers to design interventions that enhance employee control and address power dynamics to reduce bullying perceptions.}

Magnetotelluric (MT) surveys have been conducted across the Curnamona Province to provide insights on lithospheric architecture. A long-period (10–10,000 s) MT inversion of 136 AusLAMP and legacy long-period MT sites, 134 broadband MT, and 31 geomagnetic depth sounding (GDS) sites over an area 500 km by 500 km is used to create a lithospheric-scale framework for the province. In addition, a crustal-scale broadband (0.01 to 1000 s) MT inversion of 134 sites with closer spacing yields higher fidelity of crustal heterogeneity. The long-period Curnamona Province model is combined with other regional models across southern Australia, encompassing the Archean-Mesoproterozoic Gawler Craton in the west to the Phanerozoic Delamerian and Lachlan Orogens in the east. In this wider context, the Curnamona Province is shown to exhibit four distinct regions of low resistivity. (a) In the top 5 km, resistivity is most strongly influenced by the porosity of sedimentary cover. (b) The upper crust to a depth of 20 km has low resistivity < 1 Ω.m along the eastern margin of the province possibly from organic carbon deposited in the Paleoproterozoic. (c) The lower crust to the Moho (∼40 km) has low resistivity (<100 Ω.m) and is coincident with the extent of the Adelaide Rift Complex suggesting it may have resulted during a period of Neoproterozoic rifting. (d) At sub-continental lithospheric depths of 150–250 km, high electrical conductance in the central to northern part of the Curnamona Province is attributed to metasomatism at the base of the lithosphere in the Mesoproterozoic.}

However, the impact of emoji use by chatbots on consumers’ willingness to adopt recommendations has yet to receive sufficient scholarly attention. On the basis of the emotion as social information (EASI) model, this study conducts three online experiments to explore the mechanisms by which emoji use by chatbots influences the willingness to adopt recommendations within the context of tourism services. The findings from the three studies indicate that (1) compared with chatbots that do not use emojis, those that incorporate emojis significantly enhance consumers’ willingness to adopt recommendations; (2) empathy and trust serve as mediators in this relationship; and (3) relationship norm orientation and identity disclosure moderate both the main effect and the mediating effects. This study contributes to the literature on emoji use in chatbots and provides practical insights for tourism companies in the design and deployment of chatbots.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence for the impact of organized stroke multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) on outcomes in Africa is sparse.
Aim
To compare stroke outcomes, before and after the establishment (September 16, 2016) of a pioneer MDT at a tertiary hospital in southern Nigeria.
Methods
Using a retrospective, observational study design, the in-patient record of all stroke patients admitted between September 2014 to September 2018 was retrieved and rigorously reviewed. 155 patients seen 2 years before the MDT were compared with 169 stroke patients seen 2 years after the MDT. Stroke severity at admission and functioning at discharge were assessed using the Stroke Levity Scale (SLS) and the modified Rankin scale (mRS).
Results
Mean ages (in years) were 60 pre-MDT vs 59.57 post MDT (p = 0.754). There were more males, 51% pre-MDT vs 54.2% post MDT (p = 0.565). SLS and mRS were not significantly different; severe SLS and mRS pre-MDT, 52.9% vs post-MDT, 49.4% (p = 0.727) and pre-MDT 19.4% vs post-MDT 19.5% (p = 0.685) respectively. More post-MDT patients were discharged alive, pre-MDT,56.8% vs 79.2% post MDT (p < 0.001); had swallow tests, pre-MDT 9.23% vs post-MDT 33.5% (p < 0.001); on secondary prevention, pre-MDT 67.7% vs post-MDT 78.9% (p = 0.023); had more clinic visits, pre-MDT,0.7% vs post-MDT 38.3% (p < 0.001). MDT was independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality on multivariable regression, adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% Confidence interval CI) 0.17 (0.09–0.32).
Conclusion
Our results suggest that an organized MDT may improve acute outcomes and reduce mortality in resource constrained settings where there may be no stroke units. These findings need further prospective validation.}

abstract = {Background
Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is rare, aggressive, and mostly triple-negative (TN) subtype of BC. We aimed to investigate the potential prognostic significance of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138) expression in this unique tumor.
Methods
Archived charts of 50 TNBC patients [21 MpBC and 29 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)] were retrospectively evaluated. Corresponding paraffin blocks were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of SDC1. Compartmental (epithelial membranous, stromal, and cytoplasmic) staining scores were expressed in quartiles (Q) and correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
Results
The median follow-up period was 54.6 months (range: 2.2–112.7). MpBC patients showed significantly worse DFS and OS than IDC (p = 0.007 and 0.004, respectively). MpBC demonstrated significantly higher Q4 stromal and membranous SDC1 compared to IDC (p = 0.016 and 0.021, respectively), whereas IDC exhibited significantly higher cytoplasmic Q4 SDC1 than MpBC (p = 0.015). Stromal Q4 SDC1 expression was found to be an independent factor associated with MpBC relative to IDC (OR: 6.7, 95% CI: 1.24–36.90; p = 0.028). Stromal Q4 SDC1 expression was also an independent prognostic parameter for worse DFS and OS compared to Q1–3 in the whole cohort (HR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.6–10.5; p = 0.003 and HR: 5.8; 95% CI: 2.2–15.3; p < 0.001, respectively). In MpBC, cytoplasmic Q1–3 SDC1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for worse OS compared with their IDC counterparts (HR: 2.837, 95% CI: 1.048–7.682; p = 0.04).
Conclusion
This study suggests, for the first time, that differential expression and localization of SDC1 may contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of TN-MpBC. Therefore, targeting SDC1 (CD138) could emerge as a novel therapeutic approach for this devastating disease.}

However, existing methods have overlooked the influence of contextual information on segmentation and primarily rely on supporting prototypes, with limited research on query prototyping. Effectively utilizing multi-scale features and query information poses a challenging problem in this domain. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach called the multi-scale and attention-based self-support prototype few-shot semantic segmentation network (MASNet). First, a multi-scale feature enhancement module is designed to obtain features at different scales to enrich global context information. Then, simple and efficient channel attention is utilized to guide the query features related to the target class. Finally, the query prototype is matched with the query features using a self-supporting matching module. This strategy efficiently captures class-based features and addresses the issue of intra-class variance in few-shot segmentation. The experimental results on Pascal-5i, COCO-20i and Abdominal MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable robustness and improved accuracy performance.}

abstract = {Background
While Emotional Intelligence (EI) demonstrably affects academic success, literature lacks exploration of how implementing chatbot in education might influence both academic performance and students' emotional intelligence, despite the evident potential of such technology.
Aim
To investigate the associations between Emotional Intelligence (EI), chatbot utilization among undergraduate students.
Methods
A cross-sectional approach was employed, utilizing a convenience sample of 529 undergraduate students recruited through online questionnaires. The participants completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and modified and a modified versions of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model.
Results
of the 529 participants, 83.6 % (n = 440) of participants regularly used chatbot for learning. Students demonstrated a moderate average EI score (129.60 ± 50.15) and an exceptionally high score (89.61 ± 20.70) for chatbot acceptance and usage. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) positive correlation was found between chatbot usage frequency and EI total score. Gender and major emerged as significant factors, with female students (p < 0.05) and health science students (p < 0.05) utilizing chatbot less compared to male and other major students, respectively. A negative correlation (r = −0.111, p = 0.011) was observed between study hours and chatbot usage, suggesting students with higher study hours relied less on chatbot.
Conclusions
The positive correlation between chatbot use and EI in this study sparks promising avenues for enhancing the learning experience. By investing in further research to understand this link and integrate AI tools thoughtfully, policymakers and educators can cultivate a learning environment that prioritizes both academic excellence and student well-being, reflecting the values and perspectives of UAE culture.}

abstract = {In wound study and dressing development, a lack of a suitable animal model that can recapitulate the complex pathophysiology of human chronic wounds has been a major hurdle. Chronic wounds are defined as wounds that heal with a significant delay, usually over a period >2–3 months, but no current animal wound model has such a longischemia. After a longexploration, our group has developed an animal wound model with ischemia and nerve damage lasting for at least 6 months. This model can be easily combined with other conditions such as diabetes and aging for wound mechanistic study and critical testing of dressings. This report presents the method that has significant utility in evaluating therapies that could become the future standard for screening all new wound dressings.}

Adjusted flow regimes and imperviousness are contributing to increased flood risks resulting from gray infrastructure and strained subgrade drainage systems. Here a new methodology is presented for designing synthetic 3D drainage channels as blue-green infrastructure to enhance multidisciplinary decision-making for sustainable urban drainage systems planning and elements of nature-based stormwater management. LiDAR derived digital elevation models and River Builder software were used to generate four unique drainage channel scenarios with different surface geometries and vegetative cover types for flood modelling. Flood risks were assessed by fluvial simulation responses to specific channel elements and the design process may translate to real-world applications. Fluvial simulations were compared to evaluate how flood inundation patterns and flow velocities responded to morphology changes and roughness coefficients. Results suggest that incorporating geomorphic principles into open drainage channels can advance blue-green infrastructure design by reflecting more natural morphological elements and improve stakeholder engagement that is well suited for nature-based solutions. By combining high-resolution LiDAR data and process-based River Builder functions, the methodology presents a design tool for interactive investigation, adjustment, and communication of continuous 3D channel design scenarios. Although further site-specific studies are needed and additional metrics may be applied, this paper demonstrates a flexible framework to support sustainable urban drainage systems and nature-based stormwater management approaches in urbanized riverscapes.}

This study proposes panoramic sales insight (PSI), a multimodal revenue forecasting framework designed to improve the accuracy of revenue predictions for flash sales. Using historical flash sales data from the fast fashion retailer Shein, the proposed PSI framework integrates both structured and unstructured data, utilizing a text–image fusion module to fuse features from product images and text descriptions and a deep neural network to forecast revenue. The text features are extracted using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), the product image features are extracted using a vision transformer (ViT), and review keyword extraction is conducted using Fumeus. Multimodal fusion then integrates these features to deliver accurate revenue forecasting. Controlled experiments evaluate the performance of each module within the PSI framework, while ablation analysis confirms the robustness of PSI. This study provides valuable insights for managers, enabling more accurate revenue forecasting and improving the effectiveness of flash sales.}

abstract = {Background
Dementia is projected to impact 152 million people by 2050, making it one of the most pressing global health challenges. The neurodegenerative process initiates well before clinical symptoms manifest, advancing from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ultimately to dementia. Despite the growing prevalence, awareness of dementia prevention is limited, and many individuals express a desire to cease living upon diagnosis. Lifestyle interventions can mitigate cognitive decline, but there is a need for effective, scalable approaches to deliver these interventions to older adults. Digital health interventions, such as app-based just-in-time adaptive interventions, offer a promising solution, but their application in cognitively impaired older populations remains underexplored.
Objective
This formative study evaluated the plausibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive digital lifestyle intervention delivered by a rule-based conversational agent (CA) among older adults with SCD or MCI. The primary focus was on adherence to the CA-initiated conversational turns (measured objectively via interaction logs), and secondary objectives included perceptions of technology acceptance, working alliance with the CA, self-reported adherence to the suggested health-promoting activity, and feedback for future improvements (through a questionnaire and short interview).
Methods
This monocentric study investigated 15 participants (mean age 70.3, SD 5.01; 10 female and 5 male participants) with SCD (n=12) or MCI (n=3). Participants used the study app that delivered daily health-promoting activities through a CA over 2 weeks. Participants received notifications to engage in 7 health-related activities, and adherence to the activities was self-reported. Post intervention, participants rated their experience with the app and assessed their working alliance with the CA through the 6-item session alliance inventory. Data on smartphone use, demographic information, and cognitive performance (via Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were collected during a preintervention visit.
Results
Participants rated the study app positively, especially regarding ease of use and a subset of the working alliance. Adherence to the CA-initiated conversational turn was measured at an average of 81% across 14 days. In total, 27% (mean 4.07, SD 2.27) of participants indicated being vulnerable, and 100% then responded with their state of receptivity, of which 83% (mean 3.14, SD 1.61) were receptive to completing the activity, and 69% (mean 2.86, SD 1.70) self-reported adherence to the activity. There was no significant decline in adherence across the study period. Qualitative results support these findings and present two emerging themes: app enjoyment and enhancing engagement.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive interventions are feasible and generally well-accepted by older adults with SCD or MCI. However, the findings underscore the need for robust technological infrastructure and potential personal assistance to optimize adherence. Future interventions could benefit from integrating wearables to improve real-time engagement and accurately monitor adherence, ultimately supporting healthy aging and cognitive health in older populations.}

abstract = {Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has emerged as a versatile solution for fabricating parts with complex geometries in recent years. However, the existing deposition parameter planning methods struggle to offer continuous and precise parameters when the part geometry varies dynamically due to the long-term dependence, strong coupling, and hysteresis properties of the WAAM process. To address this challenge, this research introduces an advanced algorithm for generating accurate and continuous deposition parameters by learning and utilizing the welding skills of proficient human welders. The first step involves capturing kinematic and welding parameter data from proficient human welders during practical welding processes. Following this, a human skill learning algorithm is developed based on a combination of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) architecture and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to analyse and model human motions and bead deposition results. Lastly, a practical backward model is established to generate continuous deposition parameters for weld beads with varying geometry. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through the fabrication of two practical WAAM parts. The root mean square error (RMSE) values between the target geometry and the ground truth geometry of the parts are 0.1648 and 0.1805 respectively. The result demonstrates the algorithm's superior ability in optimal deposition parameters planning for fabricating parts with complex geometries.}

In cold regions, the frost-heave of soil can cause uneven railway subgrades, affecting the safety and efficiency of high-speed railways. This study proposes a novel PCW-iTransformer model for predicting frost heave, which integrates PCHIP data interpolation, CEEMDAN signal decomposition, and WPT denoising to extract sequential features. Compared to existing models like Autoformer, Crossformer, and DLinear, PCW-iTransformer achieves a reduction of 19.1% to 34.5% in error metrics and an improvement of 2.8% to 4.6% in the coefficient of determination. Additionally, a fused parameter model based on normalized moisture and temperature improves prediction accuracy, reducing MSE, MAE, and RMSE by up to 7.6%. The model also demonstrates robustness under data scarcity, maintaining stable performance with 40% continuous or 60% random missing data. Overall, PCW-iTransformer provides a reliable approach for predicting frost heave, offering valuable insights for the maintaining and long-term stability of high-speed railway subgrades in cold regions.}

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is committed to ensuring access to high-quality food, reducing hunger, and promoting sustainable fisheries to address global population growth and hunger. However, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing poses a significant challenge, threatening marine biodiversity and food security. Portugal has the 10th largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), with waters around mainland Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira. This research focuses on the Azores region, known for its traditional multispecific fishery around the island slopes and seamounts. The region's fisheries face data scarcity issues and complicating effective management. By combining Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records from 2016 to 2022 and Portuguese Navy (PoN) Fiscalization Reports (FISCREP) from 2015 to 2022, it was possible to use appropriate metrics to characterize the fishing effort and analyze the effectiveness of the inspections conducted in the Azores EEZ. The Total Boat-Meter (TBM) metric combines the number and length of boats to quantify the fishing effort better. The analysis shows that the fishing effort in the protected areas is very high, highlighting the pressure on the protected ecosystems. The findings aim to assist regulatory institutions and researchers in assessing fishing pressure and promoting sustainable fisheries management in the Azores to preserve marine ecosystems.}

However, its layout design often relies on traditional paradigms, leading to significant inefficiencies in manpower and material utilization. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework based on diffusion models, named FrameDiffusion. Leveraging the concept of transfer learning, this framework employs the Kronecker product to perform low-rank decomposition of the parameter matrix in a general large model, enabling cost-effective learning of component layout features on small-scale multimodal datasets. Furthermore, FrameDiffusion integrates the ControlNet model, facilitating the layout design of columns and braces in steel frame-braced structures under varying design conditions. The model’s performance is evaluated through both subjective and objective metrics, including mechanical performance, cost-effectiveness, and perceived quality. Experimental results demonstrate that FrameDiffusion outperforms existing methods, even surpassing engineer-designed solutions in certain aspects. Finally, this study develops an intelligent design platform that streamlines the entire workflow of steel frame-braced structure design, modeling, analysis, and optimization, significantly enhancing the automation and intelligence of structural design.}

The FSIS sample selection methods can be described as a close approximation of either a stratified or two-stage cluster sampling design. These surveys therefore support estimates of pathogen occurrence that are derived under both design- and model-based inferential paradigms. This retrospective study will describe population-level estimation strategies and how changes in pathogen contamination can be monitored across time using a trend analysis. An example based on Campylobacter on broiler chicken carcasses is provided.

WB-affected broiler breast fillets are characterized by abnormal tissue hardness, muscle rigidity, and irregular shape. Manual evaluation based on tactile palpation and visual examination is the current practice for WB assessment at poultry processing facilities, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and may induce contamination. Structured-illumination reflectance imaging (SIRI), which is capable of depth-resolved tissue characterization and three-dimensional sample topography, has emerged a potential means for poultry defect detection, as opposed to conventional uniform illumination-based imaging. This study presents a novel effort to assess WB in broiler meat using SIRI coupled with phase-measuring profilometry. An in-house assembled, broadband SIRI platform with phase-shifted sinusoidal illumination patterns at different spatial frequencies was used to acquire images from normal and WB-affected boneless chicken fillets. Acquired pattern images at each spatial frequency were demodulated into 1) one phase difference image that depicts sample surface geometry and 2) two intensity images [i.e., direct component (DC) and amplitude component (AC)]. Hand-crafted geometric and textural features were extracted from the phase difference and intensity images respectively, and used for differentiating between normal and WB-affected samples by regularized linear discriminant analysis models. The features from the phase difference images were more effective than the texture features from either DC or AC images, and the highest overall classification accuracy of nearly 93% was achieved by modeling an optimized set of features from the phase difference images, representing improvements of about 8%–11% over the accuracy obtained using the features from DC and AC images. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of sample surface topographic profiles, revealed by the phase difference images, for WB assessment. SIRI coupled with surface profilometry offers a useful tool for WB assessment of broiler breast meat. The dataset of this study has been made publicly available11https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14558847 to enourage the research into SIRI for poultry quality assessment.}

These constraints encompass factors such as the overall building size, the number, function, and size of required spaces, and even the surrounding neighborhood's existing buildings, infrastructure, and natural environment. Particularly the requirements of interior layout design are usually coupled with each other, making the design process more complex and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel manner to consider the requirements, aiming to facilitate the generation process of building's interior layout during the early design phase. Besides, this paper aims to generate vectored output, which is more applicable to export BIM model, which also benefits the subsequent design and construct steps. This paper introduces STREAMER Early Design Configurator (EDC) and SDaC Layout Designer, both of which formats the user's requirements, semi-automatically generates interior layouts and exports IFC models of the floor plans. STREAMER EDC is used to discover the potential layouts of large-scale buildings with many rooms such as hospitals, while SDaC Layout Designer focuses on residential houses with comparatively fewer rooms. These drafts are enriched with additional data, including placement information, volume details, and space utilization. Ultimately, the floor plans are exported into three-dimensional objects and exported in the IFC format. This comprehensive step paves the way for more efficient and informed building design, promoting greater flexibility and adaptability in the early stages of the architectural process.}

The cell viability of normal (HEK293) and gastric cancer (MKN28) cell lines was evaluated using IC50 values, including photodynamic activity under green light. Antioxidant potential was assessed through DPPH radical scavenging, while phytochemical contents were quantified spectrophotometrically. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified major compounds, and molecular docking studies explored their interactions with target proteins.
Results
Cell viability assays showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability, with IC50 values of 1036 μg/mL for HEK293 and 951.8 μg/mL for MKN28. To assess photodynamic activity, green light was used, revealing IC50 values of 56.62 μg/mL for normal cells and 32.53 μg/mL for cancer cells. A more pronounced reduction in cell viability was observed in cancer cells compared to normal cells. However, it demonstrates significant photodynamic activity at a concentration approximately 1/18th of the IC50 value for normal cells and about 1/29th of the IC50 value for cancer cells. The extract, with a DPPH radical scavenging IC₅₀ value of 154.15 ± 1.04 µg/mL, exhibits strong antioxidant activity, which is greater than that of BHT (230 ± 10 µg/mL). The total flavanol, flavonoid, phenolic, proanthocyanidin, and tannin contents are quantified as 24.30 ± 1.23 mg QE/g, 32.96 ± 3.23 mg QE/g, 6.31 ± 0.79 mg GAE/g, 83.41 ± 12.95 mg CAE/g, and 27.32 ± 2.30 mg GAE/g, respectively. GC-MS analysis reveals inositol (30.47%), 4-((1E)-hydroxy-1-propenyl)-2-methoxyphenol (23.04%), 3-amino-2,6-dimethylpyridine (7.41%), and 3-buten-2-one, 4-(4-hydroxy-2,2,6-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] hept-1-yl) (5.99%) as major components. Molecular docking studies reveal that 3-buten-2-one, 4-(4-hydroxy-2,2,6-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] hept-1-yl) exhibits strong binding interactions with BAF complex (6LTJ), inositol shows substantial hydrogen bonding, and 4-((1E)-hydroxy-1-propenyl)-2-methoxyphenol demonstrates significant binding with several receptors.
Conclusion
The O. aucheriana extract exhibited strong antioxidant activity and a novel photodynamic cytotoxic effect that became prominent under green light exposure. These findings suggest that the extract may possess versatile therapeutic potential.}

Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is known as TRIM19 and is a major scaffold protein organizing the PML nuclear bodies (NBs). PML NBs are membrane-less organelles in the nucleus and play a diverse role in maintaining cellular homeostasis including antiviral response. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member virus of the family Arteriviridae, inhibits type I interferon (IFN) response during infection, and nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of the virus has been identified as a potent IFN antagonist. We report that the numbers of PML NBs per nucleus were significantly downregulated during infection of PRRSV. The overexpression of all six isoforms of PML suppressed the PRRSV replication, and conversely, the silencing of PML gene expression enhanced the PRRSV replication. The suppression of PML NBs by the nsp1 protein was common in other member viruses of the family, represented by equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. Our study unveils a conserved viral strategy in arteriviruses for innate immune evasion.}

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether maternal endometriosis increased the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in Taiwanese women. The study included eligible mother–offspring pairs with maternal endometriosis (the case cohort) and mother–offspring pairs without maternal endometriosis (the comparison cohort) matched for maternal age at delivery, infant sex, and delivery date, both with offspring born during 2009–2016 and followed till 2019, from the Taiwan Maternal and Child Health Database. The incidence rates and crude hazard ratios (HRs) of development delay and cerebral palsy in the offspring delivered by mothers with endometriosis were higher than those in the offspring delivered by mothers without endometriosis (developmental delay: incidence 1.51 vs. 1.30 per 1000 person-months, crude HR = 1.16; cerebral palsy: incidence 0.04 vs. 0.03 per 1000 person-months, HR = 1.38). In model 1, the adjusted HRs of development delay and cerebral palsy in the offspring of mothers with endometriosis were 1.16 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.11–1.22, P < 0.0001) and 1.39 (95 % CI = 1.04–1.85, P = 0.0256). In model 2, these were 1.11 (95 % CI = 1.06–1.17) and 1.01 (95 % CI = 0.76–1.36), respectively. However, the HRs of intellectual disabilities and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders were not significantly different between the offspring of mothers with and without endometriosis. In conclusion, maternal endometriosis may increase the risks of cerebral palsy and specifically developmental delay in offspring.}

However, the technology that enhances our lives presents a dual reality—it offers opportunities for criminals while creating challenges for law enforcement. Fraud, particularly, has become a pervasive issue. In response, virtual asset service providers must take measures to tackle cryptocurrency-related fraud. Nevertheless, this becomes challenging if the perpetrator exists solely within the virtual world. In 1992, Neal Stephenson used the term ‘Metaverse’ to describe a virtual world where people interact with each other using avatars. Over time, the Metaverse has transformed into a complex concept akin to 'cyberspace'. The Metaverse is a virtual environment that uses technologies to mimic the real world. As this virtual space became intertwined with financial transactions, especially through cryptocurrencies, the Metaverse evolved into a medium for perpetrating scams. Within this context, the article addresses the challenges associated with criminal activity in the Metaverse. Considering the potential applications of AI, cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens, three main challenges can be identified: 1) decentralisation, 2) anonymity of the user, and 3) lack of regulation. This article examines the applicability of existing legislation to regulate criminal activity in the Metaverse through doctrinal research. Using a comparative approach, it analyses the challenges of addressing virtual crimes by contrasting fraud (Fraud Act 2006) with sexual assault (Sexual Offences Act 2003), highlighting the complexity of addressing crimes involving physical contact in virtual spaces compared to financial crimes.}

Lévi-Strauss's procedures of canonical formalization for the structural study of myth are proposed as innovative structural models in anthropology, which may radically help revise anthropological methods and goals to confront the pressing problems of the contemporary world. The morphodynamic formalization of larger unsuspected entities can be modeled, simulated, and visualized by means of these structural models built in software mechanisms, which may allow us to identify instrumental ideologies and to anticipate new social changes as a result of the mediating logical operation of a boundary condition within sociocultural systems and institutional frameworks. In particular, the boundary condition can be thought to anticipate the discursive activation of a particular cultural ideology acting as a hidden agency of instrumental politics.}

abstract = {The small-scale fisheries along the northern region of the Panay Gulf face a distinctive challenge as multiple communities compete for access to the same fishing areas and resources. In response, neighboring coastal municipalities implemented conventional management measures, such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and seasonal closures, aiming to enhance the abundance of fisheries resources. However, these measures only imposed economic hardships on artisanal fishermen. To address this issue, a survey involving 135 informants from coastal barangays was conducted between June to November 2021. The study used semi-structured questionnaires and GPS data loggers to collect essential information on the spatial and temporal distribution of fishing activities and specific target catches. The integration of local knowledge played a crucial role in bridging critical data gaps within the study site, facilitating the identification of more effective management reforms. The findings revealed that traditional harvest locations for various gear types exhibited zonation patterns across the gulf. Fishing activities were strategically conducted in areas with available resources, often disregarding municipal fishing boundaries. Coordinated management strategies are deemed imperative due to the varying timing of seasonal closures among municipalities. On the other hand, the temporal analysis of fishing activities revealed peak seasons of fisheries resources, providing a basis for adjusting the selection of target species and the duration of seasonal closures. Interestingly, the existing management measures failed to reduce the annual fishing activities and were ineffective, contrary to popular claims. This outcome was primarily due to constant shifts in the types of fishing gear used and target catches between seasons, highlighting the displacement of exploitation. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of aligning fisheries policies with the dynamic nature of small-scale fisheries. Unless these policies adapt to the evolving conditions of the sector, they are likely to remain ineffective in addressing issues faced by artisanal fishermen in the region.}

These issues span pre-clinical research, clinical trials and systematic reviews and impact the development of clinical guidance and practice. Research misconduct and inauthentic data present a further critical risk. Combined, they increase uncertainty in this highly challenging area of study and practice, drive the provision of low value care, increase costs and impede the discovery of more effective solutions.

This study aims to investigate the degree of correlated responses to selection between hands and feet and to determine whether one of the autopods has exerted a greater influence on this coevolution, focusing on their homologous elements and morphological traits. We analyzed the 38 long bones of the hands and feet from 96 modern human specimens, employing a comprehensive methodological framework that includes morphological analysis, assessments of modularity, integration, and covariation patterns under random selection. Additionally, Bayesian analyses were conducted to test whether foot morphology drives hand morphology or vice versa. Our findings indicate a high degree of morphological integration between the hands and feet, revealing a trend of increasing correlation from the first to the fifth ray. Consistent with previous studies, our Bayesian model provides robust evidence that the feet drive the morphological coevolution of human autopods, likely in response to functional selection pressures associated with bipedalism. However, our results also highlight that the intertwined evolutionary trajectories of the hands and feet are not a simple unidirectional model, underscoring the complexity of morphological integration and the diverse coevolutionary patterns among different rays, reflecting their specialized functions and evolutionary adaptations.}

abstract = {Objective
HAPpEN aims to implement and evaluate a holistic general practitioner-centered, interdisciplinary obesity management strategy in rural Germany, focusing on feasibility, health outcomes, and economic benefits.
Methods
HAPpEN is a 12-month, pragmatic single-arm, multicenter trial, informed by a formative survey, and initiated in April 2023 with 98 obese participants (body mass index, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) in Kulmbach, Germany. The program integrates nutritional counseling, physical activity, and behavior change techniques, including smartphone-based self-monitoring. Monthly consultations help set personalized goals using a multi-stage grading scale. Primary outcomes include BMI, body weight, waist circumference, heart rate, blood pressure and parameters, while secondary outcomes assess quality of life, wellbeing, health literacy, social interaction, and digital therapy support.
Results
The baseline cohort (mean age: 46.9 ± 11.8 years, 74.1 % female) exhibited high obesity rates (mean BMI: 40.1 ± 6.1 kg/m2), with 48.5 % classified as grade III obese. Common comorbidities were hypertension (51.8 %), dyslipidemia (30.5 %) and diabetes (21.8 %). Chronic joint paint, mainly in the knees and hips, affected up to 82.4 %. A familial aggregation of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases was noted, alongside behavioral challenges such as lack of physical activity (81.8 %) and unhealthy eating habits (56.8 %).
Conclusion
HAPpEN addresses obesity's multifactorial nature through general practitioner-led, community-based, and digital strategies to promote sustainable lifestyle changes in rural areas. The trial aims to inform primary care obesity management guidelines, focusing on improving health literacy, patient engagement, and long-term clinical benefits.

This can lead to transport poverty, especially among older adults without car access. Community transport, not-for-profit and primarily volunteer-run local transport schemes, helps to address this rural transport poverty in the UK. This paper focuses on the emergence and evolution of these schemes, presenting a critical analysis that traces the researchers’ discomfort that arose during a study on community transport in Oxfordshire. Unpacking this discomfort draws attention to two societal processes that have shaped the emergence and evolution of community transport: neoliberalism and automobility. Results indicate how community transport can be rolled out in response to the neoliberal roll-back of the state, in this case cuts to bus subsidies and the National Health Service (NHS). However, community transport is often itself rolled-back by the state as part of further rounds of financial cuts, prompting providers to improvise ways to continue what they understand to be an essential service. Further, community transport emerges as a car-based solution in increasingly car-dependent contexts and, as such, re-enforces and further normalizes automobility. Although community transport schemes address rural transport poverty, they do not at present tackle the source of this challenge: the interconnected processes of neoliberalism and automobility. The paper concludes with a discussion of the current role of the community sector as a sticking plaster solution to rural transport poverty, as well as its potential role in contributing to the dismantling of neoliberalism and automobility.}

This study helps to fill that gap by modeling how key variables interact in generative AI-assisted writing processes, based on survey data from 1073 postgraduate students from 21 countries studying in the UK. We used structural equation modeling to categorize AI use into three levels, from basic to advanced: 1) for technical support, 2) for text development, and 3) for transformation. Self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies positively predicted all three types of AI use. Notably, while the most advanced use of AI (i.e., for writing transformation) significantly enhanced outcomes including critical thinking, motivation, and writing quality, whereas the most basic use (for technical support) did not predict such outcomes. This study further revealed that AI self-efficacy and writing self-efficacy were significant antecedents of self-regulation, suggesting the importance of supporting students’ self-efficacy in boosting self-regulation in AI use. This suggests that the key to writing-outcome improvement may not be to teach students different uses of AI, but to develop their self-regulation to the point that they can independently explore and apply advanced uses of this technology.}

Background
There is a need for new tools for monitoring of the response to TB treatment. Such tools may allow for tailored treatment regimens, and stratify patients initiating TB treatment into different risk groups. We evaluated combinations between previously published host biomarkers and new candidates, as tools for monitoring TB treatment response, and prediction of relapse.
Methods
Serum samples were collected at multiple time points, from patients initiating TB treatment at research sites situated in South Africa (ActionTB study), Brazil and Uganda (TBRU study). Using a multiplex immunoassay platform, we evaluated the concentrations of selected host inflammatory biomarkers in sera obtained from clinically cured patients with and without subsequent relapse within 2 years of TB treatment completion.
Results
A total of 130 TB patients, 30 (23%) of whom had confirmed relapse were included in the study. The median time to relapse was 9.7 months in the ActionTB study (n = 12 patients who relapsed), and 5 months (n = 18 patients who relapsed) in the TBRU study. Serum concentrations of several host biomarkers changed during TB treatment with IL-6, IP-10, IL-22 and complement C3 showing potential individually, in predicting relapse. A six-marker signature comprising of TTP, BMI, sICAM-1, IL-22, IL-1β and complement C3, predicted relapse, prior to the onset of TB treatment with 89% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Furthermore, a 3-marker signature (Apo-CIII, IP-10 and sIL-6R) predicted relapse in samples collected at the end of TB treatment with sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 74%. A previously identified baseline relapse prediction signature (TTP, BMI, TNF-β, sIL-6R, IL-12p40 and IP-10) also showed potential in the current study.
Conclusion
Serum host inflammatory biomarkers may be useful in predicting relapse in TB patients prior to the initiation of treatment. Our findings have implications for tailored patient management and require prospective evaluation in larger studies.}

abstract = {Medical visual question answering is crucial for effectively interpreting medical images containing clinically relevant information. This study proposes a method called MedBLIP (Medical Treatment Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) to tackle visual language generation tasks related to chest X-rays in the medical field. The method combine an image encoder with a large-scale language model, and effectively generates medical question-answering text through a strategy of freezing the image encoder based on the BLIP-2 model. Firstly, chest X-ray images are preprocessed, and an image sample generation algorithm is used to enhance the text data of doctor-patient question-answering, thereby increasing data diversity. Then, a multi-layer convolutional image feature extractor is introduced to better capture the feature representation of medical images. During the fine-tuning process of the large language generation model, a new unfreezing strategy is proposed, which is to unfreeze different proportions of the weights of the fully connected layer to adapt to the data in the medical field. The image feature extractor is responsible for extracting key features from images, providing the model with rich visual information, while the text feature extractor accurately captures the essential requirements of the user's question. Through their synergistic interaction, the model can more effectively integrate medical images and user inquiries, thereby generating more accurate and relevant output content. The experimental results show that unfreezing 31.25 % of the weights of the fully connected layer can significantly improve the performance of the model, with ROUGE-L reaching 66.12 %, and providing a more accurate and efficient answer generation solution for the medical field. The method of this study has potential applications in the field of medical language generation tasks. Although the proposed model cannot yet fully replace human radiologists, it plays an indispensable role in improving diagnostic efficiency, assisting decision-making, and supporting medical research. With continuous technological advancements, the model's performance will be further enhanced, and its application value in the medical field will become even more significant.

abstract = {Background
Approximately 200,000 implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted annually worldwide, with around 20% of recipients experiencing significant psychological distress. Despite this, there are no ICD guidelines addressing mental health as part of rehabilitation programs, which primarily focus on educating patients about their condition and prognosis. There is a need to include elements such as emotional distress, social interactions, and the future use of technologies like apps and virtual communication in ICD rehabilitation, without increasing the burden on health care professionals.
Objective
This study aimed to demonstrate how data from the Readiness for Health Technology Index (READHY), combined with sociodemographic characteristics and exploratory interviews, can be used to construct profiles of recipients of an ICD, describing their ability to manage their condition, their need for support, and their digital health literacy. This aims to enhance health care professionals’ understanding of different patient archetypes, serving as guidance in delivering personalized services tailored to the needs, resources, and capabilities of individual recipients of ICDs.
Methods
Overall, 79 recipients of an ICD participated in a survey assessing technology readiness using the READHY. The survey also collected sociodemographic data such as age, sex, and educational level. Self-reported health was measured using a Likert scale. Cluster analysis categorized participants into profiles based on their READHY scores. Correlations between READHY scores and self-reported health were examined. In addition, qualitative interviews with representatives from different readiness profiles provided deeper insights.
Results
Four technology readiness profiles were found: (1) profile 1 (low digital health literacy, insufficient on 5 dimensions), (2) profile 2 (sufficient on all dimensions), (3) profile 3 (consistently sufficient readiness on all dimensions), and (4) profile 4 (insufficient readiness on 9 dimensions). Participants in profile 4, characterized by the lowest readiness levels, were significantly younger (P=.03) and had lower self-reported health (P<.001) than those in profile 3. A correlation analysis revealed that higher READHY scores were associated with better self-reported health across all dimensions. Qualitative interviews highlighted differences in self-management approaches and the experience of support between profiles, emphasizing the essential role of social support toward the rehabilitation journeys of recipients of an ICD. Two patient vignettes were created based on the characteristics from the highest and lowest profiles.
Conclusions
Using the READHY instrument to create patient profiles demonstrates how it can be used to make health care professionals aware of specific needs within the group of recipients of an ICD.}

abstract = {Generative AI applications like ChatGPT from OpenAI help users reach new levels of productivity. ChatGPT has gained countless new users signing up and sharing use cases online since its release. The paid version, GPT 4.0, was also recognized by some subscribers. However, there is a dearth of theoretical understanding regarding the generative AI subscription intentions of users. This study endeavors to explore the influence of ChatGPT users' perceived usefulness on both satisfaction and their intention to pay for a subscription, as well as the moderated mediating effect of artificial intelligence anxiety on the process of user decision-making. To achieve this goal, 274 samples were collected and validated for reliability analysis, validity analysis, regression analysis, and moderated mediation analysis by AMOS 28 and SPSS 27. The findings of this research demonstrate that perceived usefulness influences user satisfaction positively and further affects subscription payment intention. Furthermore, user satisfaction serves as a partial mediator in the connection between perceived usefulness and subscription payment intention. By employing moderated mediation analysis, this paper discovers that AI anxiety amplifies the aforementioned associations, which is counterintuitive yet intriguing. Overall, this study adds to the knowledge of generative AI users’ subscription payment intention and provides valuable insights for designing and popularizing generative AI tools.}
