abstract = {Background
Digital health technologies are widely used for disease management, with their computing platforms, software, and sensors being used for health care. These technologies are developed to manage chronic diseases and infectious bacterial diseases, including tuberculosis (TB).
Objective
This study aims to comprehensively review the literature on the use of digital health interventions (DHIs) for enhancing TB treatment adherence and identify major strategies for their adoption.
Methods
We conducted a literature search in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, and Scopus databases for relevant studies published between January 2012 and March 2022. Studies that focused on web-based or mobile phone–based interventions, medication adherence, digital health, randomized controlled trials, digital interventions, or mobile health and ubiquitous health technology for TB treatment and related health outcomes were included.
Results
We identified 27 relevant studies and classified them according to the intervention method, a significant difference in treatment success, and health outcomes. The following interventions were emphasized: SMS text messaging interventions (8/27, 30%), medicine reminders (6/27, 22%), and web-based direct observation therapy (9/27, 33%). Digital health technology significantly promoted disease management among individuals and health care professionals. However, only a few studies addressed 2-way communication therapies, such as interactive SMS text messaging and feedback systems.
Conclusions
This scoping review classified studies on DHIs for patients with TB and demonstrated their potential for the self-management of TB. DHIs are still being developed, and evidence on the impact of digital technologies on enhancing TB treatment adherence remains limited. However, it is necessary to encourage patients’ participation in TB treatment and self-management through bidirectional communication. We emphasize the importance of developing a communication system.}

abstract = {Open science is increasingly recognised worldwide, with preprint posting emerging as a key strategy. This study explores the factors influencing researchers' adoption of preprint publication, particularly the perceived effectiveness of this practice and research intensity indicators such as publication and review frequency. Using open data from a comprehensive survey with 5873 valid responses, we conducted regression analyses to control for demographic variables. Researchers' productivity, particularly the number of journal articles and books published, greatly influences the frequency of preprint deposits. The perception of the effectiveness of preprints follows this. Preprints are viewed positively in terms of early access to new research, but negatively in terms of early feedback. Demographic variables, such as gender and the type of organisation conducting the research, do not have a significant impact on the production of preprints when other factors are controlled for. However, the researcher's discipline, years of experience and geographical region generally have a moderate effect on the production of preprints. These findings highlight the motivations and barriers associated with preprint publication and provide insights into how researchers perceive the benefits and challenges of this practice within the broader context of open science.}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of PFCs on the microbial community structure and to investigate the mechanisms of their degradation by microorganisms. The results suggested that the microbial communities were influenced by the combined effects of PFCs concentration and water quality (0.33), with a notable emphasis on the impact of PFCs (0.28). The 16S rDNA gene amplicon data revealed significant variations in both the structural composition and functional aspects of microbial communities across different concentrations of PFCs (p < 0.05). In particular, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was found to interfere with several microbial metabolic functions, including DNA functions, structural pathways, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Certain bacteria, such as Hydrogenophaga, Luteolibacter, and Pseudorhodobacter, were found to synergistically promote perfluorooctanoic acid degradation. The results improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which microbes adapt to and degrade PFCs in different environments and the complex effects PFCs have on ecosystems.}

Mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), the opposite of EMT, causes tumor metastasis. EMT drives primary tumor cells, whereas MET inhibits them. Importantly, the complex network of EMT includes cell–cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Transcription factors, post-translational regulation, cytokine-mediated signaling, and microRNAs control EMT. In this review, we discussed how molecular mechanisms, signaling networks, and epithelial/mesenchymal states affect cancer treatment resistance and the tumor microenvironment. Research on immunotherapy and chemotherapy problems associated with EMT suggests that targeting EMT might be a potential cancer treatment resistance strategy.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in various healthcare domains, but their effectiveness in identifying specific clinical conditions in real medical records is less explored. This study evaluates LLMs for detecting signs of cognitive decline in real electronic health record (EHR) clinical notes, comparing their error profiles with traditional models. The insights gained will inform strategies for performance enhancement.
Methods
This study, conducted at Mass General Brigham in Boston, MA, analysed clinical notes from the four years prior to a 2019 diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in patients aged 50 and older. We developed prompts for two LLMs, Llama 2 and GPT-4, on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant cloud-computing platforms using multiple approaches (e.g., hard prompting, retrieval augmented generation, and error analysis-based instructions) to select the optimal LLM-based method. Baseline models included a hierarchical attention-based neural network and XGBoost. Subsequently, we constructed an ensemble of the three models using a majority vote approach. Confusion-matrix-based scores were used for model evaluation.
Findings
We used a randomly annotated sample of 4949 note sections from 1969 patients (women: 1046 [53.1%]; age: mean, 76.0 [SD, 13.3] years), filtered with keywords related to cognitive functions, for model development. For testing, a random annotated sample of 1996 note sections from 1161 patients (women: 619 [53.3%]; age: mean, 76.5 [SD, 10.2] years) without keyword filtering was utilised. GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency compared to Llama 2, but did not outperform traditional models. The ensemble model outperformed the individual models in terms of all evaluation metrics with statistical significance (p < 0.01), achieving a precision of 90.2% [95% CI: 81.9%–96.8%], a recall of 94.2% [95% CI: 87.9%–98.7%], and an F1-score of 92.1% [95% CI: 86.8%–96.4%]. Notably, the ensemble model showed a significant improvement in precision, increasing from a range of 70%–79% to above 90%, compared to the best-performing single model. Error analysis revealed that 63 samples were incorrectly predicted by at least one model; however, only 2 cases (3.2%) were mutual errors across all models, indicating diverse error profiles among them.
Interpretation
LLMs and traditional machine learning models trained using local EHR data exhibited diverse error profiles. The ensemble of these models was found to be complementary, enhancing diagnostic performance. Future research should investigate integrating LLMs with smaller, localised models and incorporating medical data and domain knowledge to enhance performance on specific tasks.

It is well established that the level of acceptance of these materials influences learning outcomes, but there is lack of evidence regarding the use and related impact of videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) on these aspects. This paper used linear mixed models and path analysis to investigate the influence of student acceptance of AI-generated short videos on learning outcomes compared to paper-based materials. Student acceptance was assessed based on perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), attitude (A), intentions (I), and concentration (C). The results indicate that both AI-generated short videos and paper-based materials can significantly enhance learning outcomes. AI-generated short videos are more likely to be accepted by students with lower pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at higher levels. On the other hand, paper-based materials are more likely to be accepted by students with higher pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at lower levels. These findings offer empirical evidence supporting the use of AI-generated short videos in FLL and provide suggestions for selecting appropriate learning materials in different FLL contexts.}

Traditional methods for estimating this response often rely on experimental tests or numerical simulations, which are labor-intensive, costly, and sometimes unstable. This study presents HysGAN-RC, a conditional generative adversarial network model developed to predict the hysteretic behavior of RC columns. The model was trained using 258 hysteretic loops of RC column specimens encompassing flexure, flexure-shear, and shear failure modes. By incorporating the Wasserstein distance with a gradient penalty, HysGAN-RC improves the baseline CGAN performance. The model’s effectiveness was evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metrics under various conditions. Numerical experiments show that HysGAN-RC achieves a mean IoU of 0.68 and an FID of 7.2 when utilizing ten RC design parameters, including geometric, material, and reinforcement details. The model’s performance is further supported by a mean Structural Similarity Index of 0.90, indicating strong agreement between generated and real hysteretic curves in both visual shape and mechanical behavior. Notably, HysGAN-RC can predict hysteretic shapes across varying design conditions without requiring prior knowledge of the failure type, positioning it as a promising tool for high-fidelity seismic assessment of RC columns.}

The preclinical abuse potential assessments for HSK21542 included the following studies: 1) intravenous self-administration study to explore the relative reinforcing efficacy in rats self-administering remifentanil; 2) rat drug discrimination study to examine the pharmacological similarity of the interoceptive or subjective effects of HSK21542 in rats discriminating pentazocine; 3) rat conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to test the rewarding effects; 4) rat natural physical dependence-spontaneous withdrawal study in rats chronically treated with HSK21542; 5) naloxone-precipitated withdrawal assay following chronic HSK21542 exposure to evaluate its physical dependence potential. The results showed that HSK21542 was devoid of behavioral evidence of positive reinforcing effect and did not share similar discriminative stimulus effects with pentazocine. HSK21542 also did not produce CPP in rats. In addition, HSK21542 did not produce spontaneous withdrawal or naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in rats with chronic treatments.

Clinimetric evaluation study.
Introduction
The Chinese Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire has necessitated the development of a revised version to the specific needs of individuals with upper extremity injuries with the progress of times and lifestyle changes.
Purpose of the study
This research aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of Modified Chinese Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (MC-DASH) questionnaire in individuals with upper extremity injuries.
Methods
One hundred and one individuals with upper extremity injuries (UEI) were recruited. The function of upper extremity was measured using the electronic version of MC-DASH, and compared against the Chinese Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand. The MC-DASH was reassessed within three days in all individuals. We investigated the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, content validity, criterion validity, and construct validity of MC-DASH.
Results
The internal consistency was deemed sufficient, as indicated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.986 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.957. Moreover, the mean total scores of MC-DASH on the first-test and retest were 37.86 and 38.19, respectively (ICC: 0.957, 95 %CI: 0.937–0.971, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the MC-DASH version exhibited satisfactory content validity evidenced by its strong correlation (R= 0.903, p < 0.001) with the Chinese DASH. Three major influencing factors were identified from 37 items. The cumulative variance contribution rate of the MC-DASH questionnaire was 75.76 %, confirming its construct validity.
Conclusion
The Modified Chinese Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire has been shown to be a valid, reliable, and practical tool for use in patients with upper extremity injuries.}

We included 128 studies that assessed the predictive power of ML algorithms using text, audio, and/or video data in the prediction of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder. Most studies (n = 87) were aimed at predicting anxiety, while the remainder (n = 41) focused on posttraumatic stress disorder. They were mostly published since 2019 in computer science journals and tested algorithms using text (n = 72) as opposed to audio or video. Studies focused mainly on general populations (n = 92) and less on laboratory experiments (n = 23) or clinical populations (n = 13). Methodological quality varied, as did reported metrics of the predictive power, hampering comparison across studies. Two-thirds of studies, which focused on both disorders, reported acceptable to very good predictive power (including high-quality studies only). The results of 33 studies were uninterpretable, mainly due to missing information. Research into ML algorithms using natural behavior is in its infancy but shows potential to contribute to diagnostics of mental disorders, such as anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, in the future if standardization of methods, reporting of results, and research in clinical populations are improved.}

abstract = {Obesity rates are increasing globally, and food addiction (FA1) may be an important contributing factor but there is a lack of understanding of the key psychological mechanisms that contribute to FA. The bioSocial Cognitive Theory (bSCT) proposes that substance use is predicted by biologically based personality traits and their influence on social cognitive mechanisms. While validated in substance use, bSCT has not been applied to a behavioural or non-substance addiction. However, the bSCT does not include a negative affective personality component, of which there is clear theoretical and empirical support as risk factors for FA. Thus, this study sought to test both the original bSCT model and an elaborated version related to eating (bSCT-e) that included direct and indirect punishment sensitivity pathways to identify the individual risk factors of FA. Data were collected from 204 university students (75.5% female; Mage = 24.82, SD = 9.17) via an online survey. Both original bSCT and bSCT-e models provided a good fit to the data, with the latter providing slightly better fit and accounting for more variance in FA. The findings suggest that individuals who are more reward driven and punishment sensitive hold exaggerated beliefs about the reinforcing and emotion regulation effects of eating, which may undermine eating control and increase risk of FA. This study provides potential new insights into the complex biopsychosocial mechanisms of FA, and points to potential intervention targets.}

abstract = {Objectives
To systematically evaluate the performance of COVID-19 prognostic models and scores for mortality risk in older populations across three health-care settings: hospitals, primary care, and nursing homes.
Study Design and Setting
This retrospective external validation study included 14,092 older individuals of ≥70 years of age with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 2020 to December 2020. The six validation cohorts include three hospital-based (CliniCo, COVID-OLD, COVID-PREDICT), two primary care-based (Julius General Practitioners Network/Academisch network huisartsgeneeskunde/Network of Academic general Practitioners, PHARMO), and one nursing home cohort (YSIS) in the Netherlands. Based on a living systematic review of COVID-19 prediction models using Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool for quality and risk of bias assessment and considering predictor availability in validation cohorts, we selected six prognostic models predicting mortality risk in adults with COVID-19 infection (GAL-COVID-19 mortality, 4C Mortality Score, National Early Warning Score 2-extended model, Xie model, Wang clinical model, and CURB65 score). All six prognostic models were validated in the hospital cohorts and the GAL-COVID-19 mortality model was validated in all three healthcare settings. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home settings. Model performance was evaluated in each validation cohort separately in terms of discrimination, calibration, and decision curves. An intercept update was performed in models indicating miscalibration followed by predictive performance re-evaluation.
Main Outcome Measure
In-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home setting.
Results
All six prognostic models performed poorly and showed miscalibration in the older population cohorts. In the hospital settings, model performance ranged from calibration-in-the-large −1.45 to 7.46, calibration slopes 0.24–0.81, and C-statistic 0.55–0.71 with 4C Mortality Score performing as the most discriminative and well-calibrated model. Performance across health-care settings was similar for the GAL-COVID-19 model, with a calibration-in-the-large in the range of −2.35 to −0.15 indicating overestimation, calibration slopes of 0.24–0.81 indicating signs of overfitting, and C-statistic of 0.55–0.71.
Conclusion
Our results show that most prognostic models for predicting mortality risk performed poorly in the older population with COVID-19, in each health-care setting: hospital, primary care, and nursing home settings. Insights into factors influencing predictive model performance in the older population are needed for pandemic preparedness and reliable prognostication of health-related outcomes in this demographic.}

abstract = {Objectives
Motor imagery (MI) practice has shown substantial benefits on force, but this was mostly demonstrated on force produced by isometric contractions in laboratory settings. Here, we tested a new type of MI intervention to improve force and power in expert athletes.
Design
CrossFit® athletes (n = 100) of national level were randomly assigned to experimental groups who completed a 5-week back squat training program (3 resistance training sessions/week, ~1 h per week). A first group (n = 35) received instructions to perform kinesthetic MI of the concentric phase of the back squat concomitant to its physical execution (MICONCENTRIC). A second group (n = 35) performed kinesthetic MI of the eccentric phase concomitant to its physical execution (MECCENTRIC). A control group (n = 30) completed the same amount of physical training without engaging in MI (Control).
Methods
Performance was indexed from the 5 repetition maximum (5 RM) squat workload before and after the intervention. Weekly, we assessed squat power using an accelerometer.
Results
MICONCENTRIC and MIECCENTRIC groups outperformed Control regarding pretest vs. posttest improvements in both 5 RM force and power (RP2 = 0.60, both p < 0.001). The MIECCENTRIC group also outperformed the MICONCENTRIC group for the 5 RM workload (RP2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). However, subjective evaluations revealed that athletes in the MIECCENTRIC group experienced higher effort perception and difficulty to complete the experimental task.
Conclusions
MI practice concomitant to physical training was efficient to improve force on a dynamic multi-joint exercise in expert athletes.}

However, existing methods often struggle with small sample sizes, heterogeneous feature types, and generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose TabularMDLM, a novel diffusion-based generative framework that integrates masked language modeling to synthesize high-quality tabular data. Unlike prior work, TabularMDLM applies noise only to feature values—preserving the semantic relationship between column names and values—and leverages pre-trained language models to iteratively reconstruct masked tokens during reverse diffusion. This design enhances generation quality while ensuring structural consistency. To evaluate the framework, we conduct extensive experiments on six tabular datasets of varying sizes, domains, and feature types. We compare TabularMDLM against recent baselines, including TabDDPM, CTGAN, and CTGAN+, under a privacy-conscious setting where only synthetic data is used for training and real data for testing. We also assess performance under class imbalance to validate generalization. Results show that TabularMDLM achieves consistently strong classification performance across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, outperforming baselines in both balanced and imbalanced settings. In contrast to existing methods, TabularMDLM scales to diverse data types and low-resource regimes, offering practical advantages in privacy-sensitive applications.}

This study explores how the use of Industry 4.0 technologies impacts the workplace well-being (WWB) of non-knowledge workers within manufacturing environments. In the context of the transition to Industry 5.0, where human well-being complements digital efficiency, the research aims to assess whether this impact exists and whether it is positive or negative.
Design/methodology/approach
Grounded in Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theory and aligned with the principles of Industry 5.0, the study proposes and empirically tests a theoretical model. The model includes three antecedents, system quality (SQ), experience with technology (ET), and technology use (TU), and one dependent variable: WWB. Data were collected through a structured survey of 217 non-knowledge workers in the Italian manufacturing sector and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling.
Findings
The results confirm that Industry 4.0 technologies do have a significant impact on WWB. All three antecedents positively influence well-being, with SQ exerting the strongest effect, followed by ET and TU. These findings indicate that, contrary to concerns about alienation or loss of autonomy, the adoption of Industry 4.0 machines can enhance the quality of working life for non-knowledge workers.
Originality/value
This study is among the first to empirically investigate the impact of Industry 4.0 on the well-being of non-knowledge workers, a group often overlooked in digital transformation research. By addressing this theoretical gap, the study extends the application of STS theory and offers practical insights for fostering more inclusive, human-centric industrial environments in line with the vision of Industry 5.0.}

abstract = {Context:
Utilizing pretrained language models (PLMs) has become common practice in maintaining the content quality of question-answering (Q&A) websites. However, evaluating the effectiveness of PLMs poses a challenge as they tend to provide local optima rather than global optima.
Objective:
In this study, we propose using semantic-preserving Metamorphic Relations (MRs) derived from Metamorphic Testing (MT) to address this challenge and validate PLMs.
Methods:
To validate four selected PLMs, we conducted an empirical experiment using a publicly available dataset comprising 60000 data points. We defined three groups of Metamorphic Relations (MRGs), consisting of thirteen semantic-preserving MRs, which were then employed to generate “Follow-up” testing datasets based on the original “Source” testing datasets. The PLMs were trained using a separate training dataset. A comparison was made between the predictions of the four trained PLMs for “Source” and “Follow-up” testing datasets in order to identify instances of violations, which corresponded to inconsistent predictions between the two datasets. If no violation was found, it indicated that the PLM was insensitive to the associate MR; thereby, the MR can be used for validation. In cases where no violation occurred across the entire MRG, non-violation regions were identified and supported simulation metamorphic testing.
Results:
The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed MRs could effectively serve as a validation tool for content quality classification on Stack Overflow Q&A using PLMs. One PLM did not violate the “Uppercase conversion” MRG and the “Duplication” MRG. Furthermore, the absence of violations in the MRGs allowed for the identification of non-violation regions, confirming the ability of the proposed MRs to support simulation metamorphic testing.
Conclusion:
The experimental findings indicate that the proposed MRs can validate PLMs effectively and support simulation metamorphic testing for PLMs. However, further investigations are required to enhance the semantic comprehension and common sense knowledge of PLMs and explore highly informative statistical patterns of PLMs, in order to improve their overall performance.}

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been increasingly applied to enhance the audio quality and reduce the bit rate.

In this study, we propose a voice-services-over NTN solution including a novel 6G non-terrestrial and ground network integrated framework and a lightweight Large Models (LMs)-driven codec operating at 450 bits per second. We also designed a new voice packet header and deployed an agent on-ground gateway to reduce the bandwidth overhead. The non-standard Session Initiation Protocol header was converted to the standard format while re-encapsulating Internet Protocol and User Datagram Protocol headers, replacing the conventional implementations. Additionally, an operational NTN satellite was used to evaluate the proposed ReCodec. The experimental results demonstrate that the ReCodec decreases the computational complexity by 96.61% while increasing the voice quality by 17.55% when compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms. Furthermore, the design of the packet header reduced the voice frame header to 50 bytes.}

Real-time data is acquired from several legacy machine artifacts (such as seven-segment displays, toggle switches, and knobs), smart machines (such as 3D printers), and building data (such as sound sensors and temperature measurement devices) through MTConnect data streaming protocol. Further, a multi-agent LLM framework that consists of four specialized agents – a supervisor agent, a machine-expertise agent, a data visualization agent, and a fault-diagnostic agent is developed for context-specific manufacturing tasks. This LLM framework is then integrated into a digital twin to visualize the unstructured data in real time. The paper also explores how LLM-based digital twins can serve as real time virtual experts through an avatar, minimizing reliance on traditional manuals or supervisor-based expertise. To demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of this framework, we present a case study consisting of legacy machine artifacts and modern machines.

This article proposes a metamodern workflow for public relations, one that embraces uncertainty, pluralism, and relational ethics. Drawing on recent conceptual work, we position generative AI not as a solutionist tool for efficiency, but as a provocation: a mirror of our sociotechnical condition and a medium for speculative, stakeholder-centric practice. The proposed genAI enhanced ‘what if’ workflow replaces deterministic ‘if-then’ logic models with reflective, scenario-based approaches, embedding deliberative temporality, stakeholder co-creation, and ethical humility into communication planning. This shift from managerial instrumentalist to stakeholder-centric thinking reclaims public relations as a site of societal value—not in opposition to organizational strategy, but as its reimagined core. This, we argue, enables public relations practitioners to become curators of complexity and facilitators of communitas: cultivating shared meaning across difference, rather than smoothing it over. Furthermore, we explore how genAI can support—but not substitute—this role, modeling possible futures and mapping divergent stakeholder positions. This metamodern orientation does not resolve paradoxes but inhabits them, oscillating between pragmatism and idealism, structure and fluidity. It critiques the legacy of commercial democracy and managerial instrumentalism while offering an alternative: a relational, reflexive, and socially situated praxis of public relations. This article invites scholars and practitioners to reconceive public relations not as a promotional and persuasive function, but as an anticipatory and co-creative force for public and social value.}

We further examined how consumer decision-making styles (intuitive vs. rational) and user interfaces (text-based vs. voice-based) moderated these effects. Results show that post hoc explanations enhance perceived transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing consumer trust in conversational recommendations. In text-based interfaces, consumers making hedonic decisions preferred consensus-based explanations, whereas no clear preference emerged for utilitarian decision-makers. In voice-based interfaces, utilitarian consumers favored consensus-based explanations, while no significant preference was observed for hedonic decisions. Furthermore, intuitive consumers preferred consensus-based explanations for hedonic decisions and expert-based explanations for utilitarian decisions. Rational consumers consistently favored consensus-based explanations across both decision-making domains. These findings provide valuable insights for designing conversational recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms. By tailoring explanations to decision domains, user interfaces, and consumer decision-making styles, businesses can foster greater trust and engagement, driving more favorable purchasing behaviors and improving business outcomes.}

Nine alkali halides (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, LiBr, NaBr, KBr, LiI, NaI, and KI) are used to test salt effects. The relationship between xylose rotation rate constant (kM), specific optical rotation at equilibrium ([α]eqm), α/β ratio, H chemical shift difference (ΔΔδ), Gibbs free energy difference (ΔG), hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion concentration ([H+] or [OH−]), and xylose conversion is discussed. Different salts dissolved in water result in different pH of the solutions, which affect the mutarotation of xylose, with the nature of both cation and anion. Shortly, the smaller the cation radius is and the larger the anion radius is, the greater the mutarotation rate is. In the dehydration of xylose to furfural in salty solutions, xylose conversion is positively correlated to mutarotation rate, H+ or OH− concentration, and the energy difference between α-xylopyranose and β-xylopyranose. Although the [α]eqm of xylose is positively correlated with α/β configuration ratio, there is no obvious correlation with xylose dehydration. The conversion to furfural in chlorides is superior to that in bromines and iodides, which is due to the fact that the pH of chloride salts is smaller than that of the corresponding bromide and iodized salts. Higher H+ concentration prefers to accelerate the formation of furfural. In basic salt solutions, the xylulose selectivity is higher than that of furfural at the initial stage of reaction. The furfural selectivity and carbon balance are better in acidic condition rather than in basic condition. In H2O-MTHF (2-Methyltetrahydrofuran) biphasic system, the optimal furfural selectivity of 81.0 % is achieved at 190 °C in 1 h with the assistance of LiI and a little HCl (0.2 mmol, 8 mmol/L in aqueous phase). A high mutarotation rate represents rapid xylose conversion, but a high furfural selectivity prefers in acidic solutions, which would be perfect if organic solvents were available to form biphasic systems.}

In this study, we investigated the toxicity of naphthalene on osteoblast function using osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. Naphthalene at concentrations of 5–50 μM, which were low enough to not affect cell viability, effectively suppressed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and matrix mineralization in MG-63 cells. Moreover, naphthalene downregulated the expression of osteogenic markers, including runt-related transcription factor 2, Osterix, ALP, collagen type 1 alpha 1, and osteopontin, and phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog X-linked, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The expression of β-catenin and its associated proteins was also suppressed following naphthalene treatment, leading to a reduction in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Naphthalene enhanced the intracellular reactive oxygen species level and suppressed nuclear expression of β-catenin signaling and its target molecules, including glycogen synthase kinase 3β, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, and these proteins were restored by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Treatment with lithium chloride and MG132 confirmed that naphthalene-induced reactive oxygen species generation increased GSK3β activity, thereby promoting the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin and suppressing osteogenic activity in MG-63 cells. Interestingly, MG-63 cells cultured as spheroids exhibited enhanced osteogenic potential, providing a more physiologically relevant model. In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of naphthalene on osteogenic differentiation in MG-63 cells, as validated using a 3D spheroid model. Further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying naphthalene’s effects, particularly its role in the Wnt/β-catenin/GSK3β pathway, is needed.}

The results indicate that the Apology × Internal Attribution strategy is most effective in enhancing authenticity and tolerance. Mediation analysis revealed distinct psychological pathways, whereby in faithfulness hallucination, both authenticity and tolerance mediate continuance intention, whereas in factuality hallucination, only authenticity serves as a significant mediator.

abstract = {Background
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often leads to cognitive and neurological dysfunction. Valproic acid (VPA) has a neuroprotective effect in acute central nervous system diseases; the neurotrophin 3 gene (NT-3) can maintain the survival of neurons, and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) can promote the growth of nerve axons. This study aimed to evaluate the restorative effect of VPA combined with NT-3 modified OECs (NT-3-OECs) on neurological function after TBI.
Methods
The neurological severity score (NSS) of rats was evaluated on the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 28th day after TBI modeling and corresponding intervention. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, p75 nerve growth factor receptor (P75), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament protein (NF)staining, and argyrophilic staining were used to observe the morphology of brain tissue 28 days after modeling. Moreover, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect the apoptosis rate of neurons. The changes in synapses and mitochondria in the injured area were observed by electron microscope.
Results
NT-3-OECs transplantation can increase the content of NT-3 in brain tissue, and NT-3-OECs can survive for >28 days. The NSS score of the TBI-VPA-NT-3-OECs group 28 days after cell transplantation was significantly lower than that of the other model treatment groups (P < 0.05). The morphological structure of the brain tissue was more complete, and the neurofilament fibers were neatly arranged, achieving better results than those of the other groups. The apoptosis rate of nerve cells in the TBI-VPA-NT-3-OECs group was significantly lower than in the other treatment groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of synapses in the combined intervention group was significantly higher than in the other treatment groups, and the mitochondrial structure was more complete.
Conclusion
NT-3-OECs have good biological function, and VPA combined with NT-3-OECs transplantation can effectively improve the prognosis of TBI rats.}

Among these, RcTIFY3 was selected through Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped read expression pattern analyses, suggesting its pivotal role in hormone mobilization and disease progression. Real-time fluorescence quantification was employed to monitor RcTIFY3 expression during the rose's response to M. rosae.

Based on an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) with task relevance, subjective norm, and perceived enjoyment being added, quantitative data were collected from 140 Chinese EFL learners. Structural equation modeling analysis suggested that the proposed model could effectively explain participants’ views of Grammarly. Their perceptions of ease of use significantly influenced usefulness, which had a major impact on their attitudes towards AI and behavioral intention. Perceived enjoyment and task relevance were also significant predictors of students’ perceptions of this software. The research model explained 71% of the variance of EFL learners’ intentions to use AI. Suggestions were given to teachers on implementing AI writing support.}

Large language models (LLMs) can accelerate the development of comprehensive, extensive solutions that support mental health. However, the LLMs’ capability to generate and comprehend human-like conversations is one of the main challenges faced by psychiatric counselling. This work proposes a mental health counselling LLM-based conversational agent that relies on the integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement learning. RAG provides the proposed LLM-based conversational agent with contextually relevant and accurate responses through useful information extracted from a curated dataset of psychological questions and answers pooled from mental health forums. Reinforcement Learning Integrated reward Model trained with Human feedback has also been used in the proposed framework to ensure contractually of the responses generated with moral and human values. By setting up a reward mechanism that considers variables like user feedback and empathetic scores of responses, the proposed Conversational Agent learns to prioritize empathetic answers and the ones that are user preferable. With the utilization of reward-based training, the agent was able to show substantial improvements in response quality. Improved emotional alignment, steady training dynamics, decreased hallucination rates with responses having less distress and increased empathy values were the significant outcomes. The proposed methodology ensures that the conversational agent remains attentive to the emotional requirements of people seeking for mental health care and provide improved relevance and accuracy in its responses.}

To evaluate the completeness and quality of open peer review reports from BMC journals for regression-based clinical prediction model studies in oncology, focusing on adherence to methodological standards, reporting guidelines, and constructive feedback.
Methods
We searched for published prediction model studies in the field of oncology, published in BioMed Central journals in 2021. Data extraction used the ARCADIA checklist (13-item tool assessing review quality) with additional criteria (e.g., word count, focus of comments on manuscript sections). Two investigators independently evaluated all open peer reviews, with conflicts resolved involving a third researcher. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were applied.
Results
Peer reviews were brief (median: 243 words; range: 0–677), with 82.7% focusing on methods or results but rarely addressing limitations (<20%) or generalisability. No reviewers verified adherence to reporting guidelines (e.g., TRIPOD); only one mentioned guideline use. Reviews prioritised superficial issues (67.3% focused on presentation) over methodological rigor (38.5% evaluated statistical methods). There are 19.2% suggested statistical revisions, and <1% addressed protocol deviations or data availability.
Conclusions
Our findings show that peer reviews of prediction models lack depth, methodological scrutiny, and enforcement of reporting standards. This risks clinical harm from biased models and perpetuates research waste. Reforms are urgently needed, including implementing reporting guidelines (e.g., TRIPOD+AI), mandatory reviewer training, and recognition of peer review as scholarly labour. Journals must prioritise methodological rigor in reviews to ensure reliable prediction models and safeguard patient care.}

abstract = {Background
The recent unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak in Saudi Arabia necessitated an assessment of healthcare workers' (HCWs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). This study assessed healthcare workers' knowledge regarding the transmission, contagiousness, presentation, and diagnosis of foodborne botulism, as well as their management practices, including contacting public health authorities, administering antitoxin, preparedness to respond to botulism cases and consulting generative Artificial Intelligent (AI)-chatbots, like ChatGPT.
Methods
A cross-sectional online survey targeting Saudi HCWs was conducted from May 6–19, 2024, following the first foodborne botulism outbreak. The survey, developed by infectious disease and public health experts according to the Saudi Public Health Authority (SPHA) botulism guidelines, covered several sections: demographics, knowledge about foodborne botulism, attitudes and perceptions, intended practices, and worry level. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, multivariable linear regression to assess factors influencing knowledge, and multivariable logistic binary regression to evaluate factors affecting confidence in handling botulism.
Results
Among the 1058 participants, the knowledge score was 9.69/20 (48.4 % correct ± 18 %), with higher scores among HCWs working in tertiary centers, older than 34 years, reading SPHA botulism protocol, and using scientific journals as main information sources. HCWs consulting ChatGPT had significantly lower knowledge scores (p-value < 0.001). HCWs displayed highly intended practices in managing botulism, with a mean score of 4.10/5. The self-rated management confidence was moderate (2.84 ± 1.05 out of 5-points). Multivariable logistic binary regression showed that previous experience with botulism and reading SPHA protocol were the most significant factors associated with a higher management confidence.
Conclusions
This study highlights significant HCWs’ knowledge gaps during unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak. Previous experience with botulism cases and reading recent guidelines were associated with higher knowledge and confidence, while reliance on ChatGPT was linked to lower scores. This study emphasizes the importance of timely publishing local guidelines to favorably affect both knowledge and confidence to deal with infectious outbreaks. Future research should evaluate long-term effectiveness of educational interventions.}

abstract = {Introduction
Persons with disabilities still face numerous barriers in their everyday lives, especially in transportation. The problem of access to transportation is identified through fewer daily trips and more barriers in public transport. These problems indicate transportation equity issues among persons with disabilities. Another issue recognized in previous studies was a gender imbalance in the samples that could indicate gender equality problems among persons with disabilities. This paper aims to investigate mobility and accessibility indicators among persons with disabilities, with a particular emphasis on the impact of gender, in order to explore two critical transportation equity issues: inclusivity and social justice.
Methods
The mobility and accessibility indicators analyzed in this research were the Number of daily trips, Mobility satisfaction, Infrastructure accessibility satisfaction, and Modal distributions of daily trips. The data about indicators was collected by an online version of a questionnaire. The research was performed on 100 persons with disabilities from Serbia, equally distributed by gender. The most common recorded diagnosis of the respondents was spinal cord injury.
Results
In general, respondents made 3.26 trips per day. At two transportation modes, we identified significant differences between males and females. Males frequently tripped as passenger car drivers, and females often traveled as passengers in passenger cars. Additionally, nine Bayesian linear regression models with weak informative prior distributions brought much helpful information.
Conclusions
The obtained results bring stakeholders valuable information in creating policies, practices, and recommendations to achieve specific goals related to transportation equity. Improving flexibility and time efficiency of females’ trips and resolving the problem of females’ fear of abuse and harassment in taxi cars were recognized as the two most critical topics.}

abstract = {Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy can enhance anti-tumor activity. This phase Ib clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin in combination with sintilimab and niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Methods
Patients with advanced solid tumors who had progressed after first-line or more lines of standard therapy were enrolled in the study, and received cisplatin and sintilimab on day 1 and niraparib from days 1–21 every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with sintilimab and niraparib (the same doses and schedules as before), until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicities. During the dose-escalation phase, patients were divided into three dose groups on the basis of a 3+3 dose-escalation regimen, and a dose-expansion phase was conducted based on the determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The primary endpoint was safety, including treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the secondary endpoint was efficacy. In addition, exploratory endpoints were prespecified to analyze potential biomarkers.
Results
From July 31, 2019, to July 1, 2022, a total of 26 patients were enrolled, and no DLTs were observed in the dose-escalation phase. The recommended RP2Ds of cisplatin, sintilimab, and niraparib were 60 mg/m2, 200 mg, and 100 mg every 3 weeks, respectively. All of the patients experienced varying degrees of TRAEs, and a 19.23% (5 patients) incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). With the median follow-up time of 47.9 months (95% CI: 38.8–NA), objective response rate was 26.92% (7 patients, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.57–47.79), disease control rate was 57.69% (15patients, 95% CI, 36.92–76.65), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.30 months (95% CI, 2.14–4.46) and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.03 months (95% CI, 3.41–12.66), with PFS rates of 26.92% (seven patients) and 11.54% (three patients) at 6 and 12 months, and OS rates of 69.23%, 34.62% and 11.54% at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥1% showed significantly longer PFS (3.93 months, P = 0.032) and OS (14.97 months, P = 0.036) compared to those with PD-L1 expression <1%.
Conclusion
The combination of cisplatin with sintilimab and niraparib showed a manageable safety profile and modest anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Further validation in larger, histology-specific patients is needed to confirm clinical benefit. Trial registration: https://www.chictr.org.cn/; ID: ChiCTR1900024488}

Drawing on Conservation of Resources (COR) theory and psychological ownership theory, this study examines the role of escapism in motivating workcation intentions. Escapism, as a defensive evolutionary strategy, facilitates workcation by helping individuals avoid resource depletion and pursue psychological enrichment. The study further examines how utilitarian and hedonic motivations moderate this relationship. Through two online scenario-based surveys involving 300 and 120 participants, the findings show that escapism enhances workcation intentions by fostering psychological ownership, which is sequentially mediated by perceived control and self-expression. Additionally, utilitarian motivation strengthens the effect of escapism on psychological ownership. These findings contribute to theoretical advancements in hybrid travel behavior and offer practical insights for tourism and hospitality managers aiming to design workcation experiences that balance productivity, relaxation, and personal engagement.}

Three key issues are addressed. Firstly, the paper illustrates the service process of a road reservation system. It is essential to know how the road reservation system works and the difference between it and other reservation systems. Secondly, a spatiotemporal discretization expression method based on the system-optimal traffic assignment (SOTA) model with predictive origin-destination demand for link travel time is put forward to make the supply space could be reserved, and the demand would not be mutually interfering. Thirdly, the study proposes a reverse feasible spatiotemporal route searching algorithm based on the expected arrival time to individually assign the applicants on the road network. This route searching algorithm does not use the network topology but the spatiotemporal discretized links. The departure time preference was considered in the feasible spatiotemporal route searching algorithm. Moreover, as the real demand distribution of the whole reservation area is not difficult to obtain after a period of updates, it is possible to analyze the supply-demand matching degree of the road network. Thus, four statistical indexes are proposed to assess the state variation of the road network. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The novel reverse feasible routes searching algorithm has a system-optimal trend with inputting the demand individually and an acceptable calculating efficiency. The method proposed by this paper could ensure a reliable road reservation service with accurate demand prediction. Considering the departure time preference would not bring extra burden to the road reservation system but provide more user-friendly service. Through the analysis, the supply-demand matching degree of the road network is significantly influenced by the cohesive capacity connection of the upstream and downstream links. This indicates the network structure and road attributes optimization should be considered in enhancing the road reservation service.}

The rapid adoption of scientific foundation models and their use in AI agents is changing scientific practices and thereby impacting this epistemic fabric which hinges on trust and reliance. Foundation models are machine learning models that are trained on large bodies of data and can be applied to a multitude of tasks. Their application in science raises the question of whether scientific foundation models can be relied upon as a research tool and to what extent, or even be trusted as if they were research partners. Conceptual clarification of the notions of trust and reliance in science is pivotal in the face of foundation models. Trust and reliance form the glue for the increasingly distributed epistemic labour within contemporary technoscientific systems. We build on two concepts of trust in science, namely trust in science as shared values, and trust in science based on commitments to processes that provide objective claims. We analyse whether scientific foundation models are research tools to which the concept of reliance applies, or research partners that can be trustworthy or not. We consider these foundation models within their socio-technical contexts. Allocation of trust should be reserved for human agents and the organizations they operate in. Reliance applies to foundation models and artificial intelligence agents. This distinction is important to unambiguously allocate responsibility, which is crucial in maintaining the fabric of trust that underpins science.}

Molecular docking predicted the intermolecular interactions and conformations between the phytase and the polysaccharide and correlated them to the activity recovery of phytase in the coacervate complex. PSs with two different functional groups, sulfate (iota (IC), lambda (LC), and kappa (KC) carrageenan) and carboxylate (low methoxyl pectin (LMP) and sodium alginate (SA)) were investigated. The optimized conditions for coacervation and activity recovery were pH 4 with a phytase-to-polysaccharide volume ratio of 12:1. Zeta potential measurements, FTIR spectroscopy, and molecular docking confirmed that electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were the main driving forces for coacervate formation. Coacervate complexes of phytase formed with LMP, SA, or KC showed a high activity retention after immobilization, with approximately 30% yield of complex and 75% immobilization efficiency of the phytase. The lower enzyme activity retention observed for IC and LC complexes is attributed to these PSs binding to the enzyme's active site. Overall, this work contributes to the body of knowledge about intermolecular interactions between phytase and polysaccharides and can serve as a guide to formulating stable, functional ingredients for a plant-based diet.}

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health concern and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, challenges remain in deploying effective screening strategies for early-stage CRC. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a fecal-based syndecan-2 (SDC2) methylation test for the detection of colorectal lesions and CRC.
Methods
We retrospectively collected data on participants who underwent fecal SDC2 methylation testing from January 1, 2019, to May 30, 2023. Patients with positive results were recommended to undergo colonoscopy. Performance indicators associated with certain clinical characteristics, including positive rate (PR), positive predictive value (PPV), and colonoscopy compliance rate (CCR), were subjected to statistical analysis.
Results
We analyzed data from 113,209 participants, of whom 11,841 (10.4% PR) had positive fecal SDC2 methylation test results. A total of 4315 participants with positive results adhered to the colonoscopy recommendations, and the CCR was 36.4%. Finally, 3169 colorectal lesions were detected, including 1134 polyps, 875 non-advanced adenomas (NAAs), 770 advanced adenomas (AAs), and 390 CRCs, with PPV values of 26.3% (1134/4315), 20.3% (875/4315), 17.8% (770/4315), and 9.0% (390/4315), respectively. Notably, the PPV for CRC increased significantly with age (χ2 = 164.40, P < 0.0001). In addition, as the cycle threshold (CT) values increased, the PPVs of AAs and CRCs generally decreased, whereas those of NAAs and polyps significantly increased. Moreover, the clinical patient group had the highest incidence of late-stage CRC (stage II and higher), whereas asymptomatic populations from the staff physical examination group and rural town-based screening programs had the highest number of stage 0 and I CRCs detected (P = 0.0107).
Conclusions
This study indicates that fecal SDC2 methylation testing combined with colonoscopy may be an effective screening method for colorectal lesions and CRC.}

Digital games have become an important educational tool for learning and teaching. The development of such games has advanced from 2D, desktop-based technologies to 3D, augmented reality (AR) / virtual reality (VR)-based technologies. Yet digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) with AR/VR has only recently started to be investigated, owing to the emerging availability of these new technologies. This position paper begins with a short review of the educational benefits of DGBLL, followed by a discussion of the use of AR/VR in language learning. To illustrate the potential use of AR/VR in DGBLL, recent empirical studies are reviewed. Based on this analysis, a new model for integrating AR/VR in DGBLL is proposed. The paper ends with suggestions for how DGBLL with AR/VR technologies can be used in future educational endeavors.}

However, due to the rapid and unpredictable rise of flash flood discharge and the limited availability of analysis data on short temporal scales, developing robust forecast error correction methods remains a challenge. In this study, we employed a physically-based distributed hydrological model combined with deep learning techniques to develop a real-time error correction method for continuous flash flood forecasting based on sliding runoff-rain data. Taking a typical mountainous river in southwestern China as the study area, we established three input schemes: “sliding runoff data only” (Scheme 1), “hydrological model outputs and sliding runoff data” (Scheme 2), and “hydrological model outputs and sliding runoff-rain data” (Scheme 3). We compared the real-time correction performance of three deep learning models with different architectures—CNN, LSTM, and Transformer—under different input schemes. The results indicate that: 1) LSTM performed the best and most consistently according to the three main evaluation metrics. Although the Transformer showed performance fluctuations, it demonstrated great potential in long forecast correction times, where the correlation between feature inputs and target values is relatively weak. 2) After adding sliding cumulative maximum precipitation data, CNN performance improved significantly, especially in correcting multi-peak floods. 3) The length of the forecast correction time has a significant impact on correction performance. When the forecast correction time approximates the basin’s lag time of runoff concentration, the corrected results have reached a relatively reliable level and entered a more stable phase. This method effectively improves the accuracy of real-time flash flood multiple-hour-ahead forecasting and could provide reliable references for disaster management authorities.}

abstract = {Purpose
To provide a proof-of-concept analysis of the appropriateness and performance of ChatGPT-4 to triage, synthesize differential diagnoses, and generate treatment plans concerning common presentations of knee pain.
Methods
Twenty knee complaints warranting triage and expanded scenarios were input into ChatGPT-4, with memory cleared prior to each new input to mitigate bias. For the 10 triage complaints, ChatGPT-4 was asked to generate a differential diagnosis that was graded for accuracy and suitability in comparison to a differential created by 2 orthopaedic sports medicine physicians. For the 10 clinical scenarios, ChatGPT-4 was prompted to provide treatment guidance for the patient, which was again graded. To test the higher-order capabilities of ChatGPT-4, further inquiry into these specific management recommendations was performed and graded.
Results
All ChatGPT-4 diagnoses were deemed appropriate within the spectrum of potential pathologies on a differential. The top diagnosis on the differential was identical between surgeons and ChatGPT-4 for 70% of scenarios, and the top diagnosis provided by the surgeon appeared as either the first or second diagnosis in 90% of scenarios. Overall, 16 of 30 diagnoses (53.3%) in the differential were identical. When provided with 10 expanded vignettes with a single diagnosis, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 increased to 100%, with the suitability of management graded as appropriate in 90% of cases. Specific information pertaining to conservative management, surgical approaches, and related treatments was appropriate and accurate in 100% of cases.
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 provided clinically reasonable diagnoses to triage patient complaints of knee pain due to various underlying conditions that were generally consistent with differentials provided by sports medicine physicians. Diagnostic performance was enhanced when providing additional information, allowing ChatGPT-4 to reach high predictive accuracy for recommendations concerning management and treatment options. However, ChatGPT-4 may show clinically important error rates for diagnosis depending on prompting strategy and information provided; therefore, further refinements are necessary prior to implementation into clinical workflows.
Clinical Relevance
Although ChatGPT-4 is increasingly being used by patients for health information, the potential for ChatGPT-4 to serve as a clinical support tool is unclear. In this study, we found that ChatGPT-4 was frequently able to diagnose and triage knee complaints appropriately as rated by sports medicine surgeons, suggesting that it may eventually be a useful clinical support tool.}

abstract = {Background
Amid growing concern over children’s access to online pornography, policy makers are looking toward new and emerging technological concepts for unexplored solutions including artificial intelligence and facial recognition.
Objective
This study sought to explore and ideate emerging technological interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective in preventing and controlling the exposure of young people to online pornographic material.
Methods
We conducted a series of qualitative co-design workshops with both adult (n=8; aged 32-53 years) and adolescent participants (n=4; aged 15-17 years) to ideate potential technological interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective at preventing and controlling the exposure of young people to online pornographic material. A story stem methodology was used to explore participants’ attitudes toward two unique technological prototypes.
Results
Participants expressed a generally favorable view of the proposed technological concepts but remained unconvinced of their overall utility and effectiveness in preventing the intentional viewing of pornography by young people. Age-appropriate parent-child conversations remained participants’ preferred approach to mitigating potential harms from pornographic material, with parents also expressing a desire for more educational resources to help them better navigate these discussions. User privacy and data security were a primary concern for participants, particularly surrounding the use and collection of biometric data.
Conclusions
Internationally, policy makers are taking action to use age assurance technologies to prevent children’s access to online pornography. It is important to consider the needs and opinions of parents and young people in the use and implementation of these technologies. Participants in this study were generally supportive of new and emerging technologies as useful tools in preventing the accidental exposure of young people to online pornographic material. However, participants remained less convinced of their ability to avert intentional viewing, with substantial concerns regarding technological efficacy, adaptability, and user privacy. Further, co-design and prototype refinement are needed to better understand user acceptability and comfortability of these new technological interventions, alongside additional research exploring sociocultural differences in information needs and user experiences.}

abstract = {Fatigue of materials stands as a prevalent cause of mechanical structure failures, which often occur suddenly, unpredictably, and catastrophically. Accurately predicting the fatigue lifespan of materials is crucial, especially given the potential for fatigue failure to occur within a short design life. While traditional methodologies based on S-N curve models remain prevalent in industry, there is a contemporary shift towards employing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to significantly refine the accuracy of fatigue lifetime predictions. In this study, a dataset containing experimental data from various structural steels is used. Through preprocessing and feature selection, four techniques are explored: Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGB Regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), aiming to identify the most effective algorithm. The implementation of these methodologies for fatigue lifetime prediction yields substantial outcomes. All models exhibit satisfactory performance, with XGB Regression demonstrating superior effectiveness. Furthermore, Polynomial Regression provides highly satisfactory results, almost identical to the Artificial Neural Network. Notably, it requires significantly less computational power, making it a practical alternative in cases of restricted computational resources or limited implementation time. Overall, the proposed methodology effectively leverages material preprocessing details, mechanical properties and experimental conditions to provide accurate predictions of the remaining fatigue lifespan of structural steels.}

The receptor tyrosine kinase Kit is expressed in cells derived from the trunk neural crest (NC), such as melanocytes; however, its role in cranial NC cell development is not fully understood.
Methods
We investigated the effects of the heterozygous loss of Kit in NC cells during embryonic development by mating Kit2lox/+ mice with Wnt1-Cre mice to produce Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ embryos. In addition, Wnt1-Cre mice were mated with Rosa26R-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) mice to visualize the tissue regions expressing Cre recombinase. Histological studies of the craniofacial regions of these mice were performed using samples from embryonic day (E) 12.5 and postnatal day (P) 1. Cellular apoptosis and proliferation were both analyzed through the immunostaining of tissue sections collected on E13.5 and E14.5 using anti-cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) to detect apoptosis and anti-Ki67 to detect proliferation. Cells from YFP-positive tissue regions of the facial areas of Wnt1-Cre; Kit+/+; Rosa26R–YFP embryos and Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+; Rosa26R–YFP embryos collected on E12.5 and E15.5 were cultured and evaluated for cell proliferation.
Results
Compared with control littermates, Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ embryos exhibited midline cleft lip and bifid nose deformities. Substantial early (P1) postnatal lethality was observed in Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ mice, with none surviving to 3 weeks of age. YFP-positive cells from the maxillary regions of Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+; Rosa26R–YFP embryos exhibited defective cell growth and self-renewal in vitro.
Conclusion
Conditional heterozygous loss of Kit in Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ embryos is associated with craniofacial dysplasia and exhibit defective NC development in vitro and in vivo.}

However, the impact of emoji use by chatbots on consumers’ willingness to adopt recommendations has yet to receive sufficient scholarly attention. On the basis of the emotion as social information (EASI) model, this study conducts three online experiments to explore the mechanisms by which emoji use by chatbots influences the willingness to adopt recommendations within the context of tourism services. The findings from the three studies indicate that (1) compared with chatbots that do not use emojis, those that incorporate emojis significantly enhance consumers’ willingness to adopt recommendations; (2) empathy and trust serve as mediators in this relationship; and (3) relationship norm orientation and identity disclosure moderate both the main effect and the mediating effects. This study contributes to the literature on emoji use in chatbots and provides practical insights for tourism companies in the design and deployment of chatbots.}

abstract = {Objectives
Despite intramuscular (IM) midazolam being recommended as a primary treatment for status epilepticus (SE), its usage in Malaysian prehospital settings remains suboptimal. This study aimed to explore the awareness, practice, and barriers among healthcare professionals regarding the use of IM midazolam as a rescue medication for prehospital SE in Malaysia and provide a consensus for its implementation.
Methods
An online cross-sectional survey and modified Delphi study was conducted among healthcare professionals across Malaysia from 22 March to 31 August 2024. A modified Delphi process was used to develop a consensus from existing literature, with two Delphi rounds assessing the relevance, clarity, and importance of each question. Consensus was achieved if 90 % or more participants agreed.
Results
Among 137 responses, 89.1 % of healthcare professionals were aware of rescue medications. However, only 62.0 % recognized the superior absorption and bioavailability of IM midazolam over rectal diazepam, and 78.1 % were aware of its efficacy in terminating seizures. Of those (69.3 %) involved in SE management, 29.5 % (n = 28) were engaged in prehospital management of SE. Only 35.7 % (n = 10) reported that prehospital personnel were permitted to use IM midazolam for SE management and all required physician endorsement. Notably, 78.9 % of participants reported that 25 % or fewer patients with SE were treated with IM midazolam. The main barriers include unfamiliarity (64.2 %) and lack of protocols (62.1 %). A strong consensus was reached on the recommendation of IM midazolam as a first-line treatment for SE management.
Conclusion
While Malaysian healthcare professionals are aware of rescue medications for prehospital seizure emergencies, they lack an understanding of IM midazolam's benefits. Key barriers include unfamiliarity and lack of protocols despite strong consensus on its first-line use.}

abstract = {When applying blockchain sharding technology in the building Internet of Things (IoT) domain to enhance the throughput performance of the blockchain, cross-shard transactions triggered by device collaborative tasks have increasingly become a prominent issue. Existing solutions base their shard division on historical transaction moments, using the outcomes for future transaction processing. However, since the historical interaction characteristics do not accurately reflect the interaction details within specific fine-grained time periods, this leads to poor system performance. Additionally, the parameter configuration in blockchain sharding systems is mostly based on arbitrary or default settings, which also results in unstable system performance. To address these two challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain sharding scheme called AI-Shard. Firstly, the system includes a module, G-AI, that utilizes generative AI to predict future node interaction relationships, enabling more proactive and adaptive shard division based on the predicted interaction matrix. Secondly, the system integrates a reinforcement learning module, DL-AI, specifically tailored for configuring parameters of the blockchain sharding system, such as the number of shards, block size, and block interval, to automatically optimize them, aiming to further enhance the system's throughput. Experimental results show that AI-Shard can reduce the proportion of cross-shard transactions and improve the system's throughput.}

abstract = {Objectives
Aging-associated body composition changes lead to a decrease in muscle mass and strength, affecting the functionality of older adults. Myostatin and musclin are myokines that regulate muscle metabolism and may modulate muscle changes during aging. Our objective was to determine the relationship between myostatin, musclin, and nutritional status with physical functionality in older adults.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study of a subsample of a stratified random sampling population survey in community-dwelling 60–90-year-old adults of both sexes. Serum myostatin and musclin concentrations were measured using MILLIPLEX technology (Merck Millipore, USA). Trained personnel recorded body mass index (BMI), and waist (WC), calf (CC), and arm (AC) circumferences as indicators of nutritional status. Functionality tests included handgrip strength (GS), walking speed (WS), and Advanced Activities of Daily Living.
Results
Of 101 participants, 55.4% were women, 56.4% were between 60 and 69 years old, 53.5% had abdominal obesity, 23.8% had dynapenia, and 33.7% had low WS. Neither myostatin nor musclin showed significant changes from 60 to 90 years. In a multiple lineal regression model, myostatin showed an inverse correlation with BMI, CC, and AC in men (P < 0.05) but did not explain GS or WS. In a similar analysis, musclin and WC showed an inverse correlation with GS (P < 0.05). Moreover, myostatin was lower in the more physically active men (P < 0.05) but musclin did not show any relationship with the Advanced Activities of Daily Living scale.
Conclusions
Myostatin and musclin do not decrease with aging and are associated with nutritional and metabolic status. Musclin is associated with dynapenic obesity in older adults.}

The same GxE interactions may affect wellbeing measures, which go beyond categorical diagnoses and reflect the health-disease continuum. We evaluated GxE effects in the UK Biobank, considering as outcomes subjective wellbeing (feeling good and functioning well) and objective measures (education and income). We estimated the polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Stressful/traumatic events during adulthood or childhood were considered as E variables, as well as social support. The addition of the PRSxE interaction to PRS and E variables was tested in linear or multinomial regression models, adjusting for confounders. We included 33 k–380 k participants, depending on the variables considered. Most PRSs and E factors showed additive effects on outcomes, with effect sizes generally 3–5 times larger for E variables than PRSs. We found some interaction effects, particularly when considering recent stress, history of a long illness/disability/infirmity, and social support. Higher PRSs increased the negative effects of stress on wellbeing, but they also increased the positive effects of social support, with interaction effects particularly for the outcomes health satisfaction, loneliness, and income (p < Bonferroni corrected threshold of 1.92e-4). PRSxE terms usually added ∼0.01–0.02% variance explained to the corresponding additive model. PRSxE effects on wellbeing involve both positive and negative E factors. Despite small variance explained at the population level, preventive/therapeutic interventions that modify E factors could be beneficial at the individual level.}

For instance, ASER is crucial to understanding the underlying decision-making in real-world applications such as mental health monitoring systems. Researchers, therefore, have focused attention on advancing the interpretability and explainability of ASER models. Interpretability maximizes human understanding of complex processes by providing meaningful insights. Explainability presents the interpretable insights in a clear and human-understandable manner. Some standard interpretability methods include feature importance, feature selection methods, and attention models. Explainability methods include SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), visualizations using embedding plots, saliency maps, etc., and feature importance analysis.

This review provides an analytical examination of CXCR4 antagonistic peptides,the selective Mavorixafor (X4P-001), an advanced, selective CXCR4 inhibitor. When Mavorixafor binds to the same location as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), it disrupts the CXCR4 protein receptor, stopping signals that help cancer grow and spread, as well as the formation of new blood vessels. Mavorixafor blocks cancer cell progression and metastatic growth in different tumor models while strengthening chemotherapy results, radiotherapy outcomes, and checkpoint inhibitor performance. Antagonistic peptides AMD3100 (Plerixafor), LY2510924, and POL6326, as well as their therapeutic potential. Mavorixafor is a promising option for cancer treatments that combine different therapies because it stays attached to its target for a long time and can be taken by mouth. Clinical studies have demonstrated that Mavorixafor produces promising outcomes when combined with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors during the treatment of hematological malignancies alongside solid tumors. Mavorixafor is promising for cancer treatment because it works well with other therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy, as well as targeted therapies and radiation therapy. Research from Mavorixafor will focus on two main areas: personalized medicine development and new delivery systems and their broad medical applications extending beyond oncology. As a potential CXCR4 antagonist, Mavorixafor shows promise as a transformative tool in cancer care because it regulates the tumor microenvironment (TME) while increasing the degree of therapeutic benefits.}

abstract = {With the ongoing advancements in autonomous navigation technology, agricultural robots are increasingly being deployed across various sectors of agriculture. Among the critical components of this technology, dynamic obstacle avoidance in complex agricultural environments serves as the foundation for enhancing the autonomy and safety of these robots. The Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) is a widely recognized method for achieving local obstacle avoidance. It operates by sampling the robot's velocity space and then evaluating the sampled trajectories using a value function to determine the optimal velocity pair. However, a significant limitation of the traditional DWA method lies in its fixed weights for the value function, which restricts its performance to manual tuning and renders it less adaptable to intricate and dynamic obstacle environments. To address this limitation, we introduced an innovative approach by integrating the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method into the weight determination process of the DWA algorithm's value function. This integration enabled the weight coefficients to adapt dynamically in response to environmental variations, thereby enhancing the algorithm's flexibility and effectiveness. Our extensive simulation and field testing revealed that while the traditional DWA algorithm struggled to navigate complex dynamic obstacle environments, the proposed TD3-DWA algorithm achieved a success rate of over 90 % in obstacle avoidance. This outcome underscored the algorithm's adaptability and robustness, positioning it as a reliable solution for ensuring safe and efficient navigation in agricultural robotics.}

To address these issues, we propose BatteryGPT, a frozen pre-trained Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) framework tailored for lithium-ion battery energy forecasting. Instead of retraining the entire model, our approach fine-tunes only the input embedding and output projection layers, enabling efficient adaptation to varied battery conditions. To enhance temporal feature representation, we introduce a contrastive temporal embedding module that compresses multivariate sequences while retaining essential dynamic features. Furthermore, we design a temporal suffix alignment strategy to align time-series data with textual prompts, improving the model’s capacity for temporal reasoning. Experiments show that BatteryGPT achieves an average 55.52% improvement in prediction accuracy over LSTM and conventional deep learning baselines. Instruction-based evaluations further demonstrate its end-to-end applicability in dynamic charging management scenarios. These results highlight the potential of integrating large language models with time-series adaptation techniques for industrial energy forecasting tasks.}

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is committed to ensuring access to high-quality food, reducing hunger, and promoting sustainable fisheries to address global population growth and hunger.

Portugal has the 10th largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), with waters around mainland Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira. This research focuses on the Azores region, known for its traditional multispecific fishery around the island slopes and seamounts. The region's fisheries face data scarcity issues and complicating effective management. By combining Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records from 2016 to 2022 and Portuguese Navy (PoN) Fiscalization Reports (FISCREP) from 2015 to 2022, it was possible to use appropriate metrics to characterize the fishing effort and analyze the effectiveness of the inspections conducted in the Azores EEZ. The Total Boat-Meter (TBM) metric combines the number and length of boats to quantify the fishing effort better. The analysis shows that the fishing effort in the protected areas is very high, highlighting the pressure on the protected ecosystems. The findings aim to assist regulatory institutions and researchers in assessing fishing pressure and promoting sustainable fisheries management in the Azores to preserve marine ecosystems.}

To evaluate the quality, readability, and accuracy of large language model (LLM)–generated patient education materials (PEMs) on childhood glaucoma, and their ability to improve existing the readability of online information.
DESIGN
Cross-sectional comparative study.
METHODS
We evaluated responses of ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard to 3 separate prompts requesting that they write PEMs on “childhood glaucoma.” Prompt A required PEMs be “easily understandable by the average American.” Prompt B required that PEMs be written “at a 6th-grade level using Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) readability formula.” We then compared responses’ quality (DISCERN questionnaire, Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool [PEMAT]), readability (SMOG, Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level [FKGL]), and accuracy (Likert Misinformation scale). To assess the improvement of readability for existing online information, Prompt C requested that LLM rewrite 20 resources from a Google search of keyword “childhood glaucoma” to the American Medical Association–recommended “6th-grade level.” Rewrites were compared on key metrics such as readability, complex words (≥3 syllables), and sentence count.
RESULTS
All 3 LLMs generated PEMs that were of high quality, understandability, and accuracy (DISCERN ≥4, ≥70% PEMAT understandability, Misinformation score = 1). Prompt B responses were more readable than Prompt A responses for all 3 LLM (P ≤ .001). ChatGPT-4 generated the most readable PEMs compared to ChatGPT-3.5 and Bard (P ≤ .001). Although Prompt C responses showed consistent reduction of mean SMOG and FKGL scores, only ChatGPT-4 achieved the specified 6th-grade reading level (4.8 ± 0.8 and 3.7 ± 1.9, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
LLMs can serve as strong supplemental tools in generating high-quality, accurate, and novel PEMs, and improving the readability of existing PEMs on childhood glaucoma.}

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is independently associated with risk of atherosclerotic events, even when LDL-cholesterol levels appear controlled. This INTERASPIRE study determined the frequency of HTG and residual combined dyslipidemia and their related factors in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) from 13 countries across six World Health Organization (WHO) regions.
Methods
Participants with CHD underwent a standardized study interview and examination, including a centralized analysis of fasting blood samples. Elevated triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol were defined as ≥ 1.7 mmol/L and 1.8 mmol/L, respectively. Elevation in both was considered combined dyslipidemia.
Results
Lipid profiles were available for 4069 patients. The mean age was 60.1 years (21.1 % women, 12.6 % smokers, 24 % obesity by body mass index [BMI], 61 % hypertension, and 44 % self-reported diabetes). Participants were evaluated 1.05 (0.76–1.45) years after their index CHD hospitalization. Overall, 12.7 % used no lipid-lowering therapies (LLT), 50.0 % used high-dose statins, and 11.8 % used combination therapies. Specific TG-lowering therapies were used by 2.3 %. One-third of patients had HTG, and 24.6 % had combined dyslipidemia. HTG was seen in all countries, but median TG values varied, with higher values among those not using LLT. HTG was independently associated with female sex, smoking, BMI, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol. HTG was inversely associated with HDL-cholesterol.
Conclusions
HTG and residual combined dyslipidemia are common, although with wide variability between countries. A healthier lifestyle, weight reduction, greater use of combination therapy, and evidence-based TG-lowering treatments are necessary to reduce the risks of HTG and combined dyslipidemia.}

Reflective assignments are a powerful tool in undergraduate STEM courses to promote student metacognition and give instructors and researchers a view of that process. We were interested in understanding student challenges in our developmental biology course, so we used reflective assignments to uncover these challenges and also add to our understanding of student metacognition in upper-level courses. We used structural and initial coding and themed student responses. Then, we were able to compare results across two different course formats. We also compared these analyses with student performance on weekly formative assessments and completed item analysis. Our analyses suggest that students struggle the most with application. Notably, student responses did not differ in an asynchronous online class versus a high-flex in-person class. We also surveyed students (n = 162) on their use and perceived value of the metacognitive assignments for further comparison to other studies of upper-level student metacognitive regulation. Results indicate a strong majority of students completed more than half of the assignments, found the assignments beneficial to their learning, and used the opportunity to plan study time. Overall, we find that upper-level college students have accurate metacognitive knowledge, allowing them to identify challenging topics and cognitive skills, and have acquired the metacognitive regulation tools to develop study plans when prompted by a reflective assignment.}

abstract = {The emergence of large language models (LLM) has driven a significant increase of AI workload in data center power demand. Renewable-powered solutions to decarbonizing LLM workload and reducing electricity costs are faced with the combined volatility of stochastic user requests and renewable energy. The key to removing the barriers in sustainable AI development lies in the adjustable capability of LLM power profiles. Therefore, this paper focuses on exploring the potential load flexibility of LLM workload and proposes a coordinated scheduling framework, notably, without computing performance degradation. Driven by the existence of the energy-optimal core frequency for graphics processing units (GPU), the energy-performance decoupling phenomenon is discovered and proved, where collaborative scaling in GPU quantity and frequency can change power but not computing performance. Motivated by this, the framework slows down the fine-tuning cluster and utilizes idle GPU resources from the inference cluster to maintain the computing performance of fine-tuning tasks. Consequently, the power consumption of the total cluster is reduced, which provides a fresh source of load flexibility. Furthermore, the framework employs dynamic frequency scaling to more flexibly modify the power profile of the expanded fine-tuning cluster. The computing performance is particularly guaranteed through temporal coupling constraints. In a simulated study supported by real-world data, the results prove a 6.8% power-saving ability and 11.3% cost-saving gains on average.}

A possible framework for understanding teacher contributions to the education of socially disadvantaged students is the concept of student engagement. This multiple case study was conducted in five schools with a high proportion of socially disadvantaged students. Repeated interviews were conducted with teachers, school management, parents, students, and counselors at selected schools. The study thus focuses on teachers’ strategies to support engagement among socially disadvantaged students during teaching with regard to the affective, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of engagement. The results show that teachers implement strategies that foster engagement among socially disadvantaged students. Teaching is designed to be interesting for students and evoke positive emotions, support the development of trust-based relationships, and respond to the individual learning needs of students. This support is directed primarily at encouraging participation, whereas support for learning itself tends to be rather secondary—often due to low expectations and teaching goals oriented more toward the perceived practical life orientations of the students.}

Nevertheless, it is quite challenging to design multiband topological structures on demand via traditional empirical methods that rely on trial and error. Here, we present a novel inverse design paradigm for multiband higher-order elastic topological insulators based on deep learning techniques. A generative model that enables a vast design space is first developed, incorporating a rich series of unit cell patterns with the desired crystalline symmetry and fabrication feasibility. Thereafter, a predictive model is constructed to efficiently forecast the dispersion characteristics of any given unit cell, thereby accelerating the discovery of potential multiband topological structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reusability of the proposed design framework through diverse examples of multiband higher-order elastic topological insulators with multi-frequency corner states. This deep learning-driven approach addresses the limitations of conventional inverse design methods, which often require computationally expensive simulations and lack flexibility to variable design tasks. Our work underscores great potential of deep learning techniques for the inverse design of high-performance topological metamaterials.}

Population-based penetrance studies of breast cancer gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in the Eastern Chinese population are currently lacking; thus, we aimed to investigate the penetrance of breast cancer and other malignant tumors among BRCA1/2 P/LP variant carriers using a population-based breast cancer cohort from communities in Eastern China.
Methods
Between July 2019 and March 2021, we tested 2216 breast cancer probands from Chinese communities for BRCA1/2 mutations and collected detailed information on the age, survival status, and malignancy history of first-degree relatives. The kin-cohort method was used to calculate the penetrance of breast cancer and other malignant tumors.
Results
Of the 2216 breast cancer probands, 109 (4.90%) carried BRCA1/2 P/LP variants, 49 in the BRCA1 gene and 60 in the BRCA2 gene. The penetrance of female breast cancer by 85 years of age was 22.50% and 18.20% in BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers, respectively. The penetrance of ovarian cancer by 85 years of age was 26.00% in BRCA1 P/LP variant carriers. The penetrance of other malignancies did not reach statistical significance owing to the small number of events.
Conclusions
Our findings showed that breast cancer penetrance among BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers was 22.50% and 18.20%, respectively, which suggests that prophylactic mastectomy may not be necessary for such Chinese individuals.

The permeance of He, Ar, and N2 demonstrated a trend of activated diffusion as permeance increased with an increase in the temperature; O2 permeance, however, reached its maximum value at about −80 °C. O2 permeance increased with a decrease in the temperature (30 to −80 °C), and permeance then gradually decreased (−80 to −130 °C), which demonstrates surface diffusion. In the case of O2/He binary separation, both O2 and He permeated according to molecular sieving at 30 °C, but at −115 °C, O2/He selectivity was enhanced approximately 10-fold due to permeation blockage by adsorbed O2. On the other hand, in the case of O2/N2 binary separation at −115 °C, the effect of permeation blocking by adsorbed O2 permeance was lessened due to the effect of competitive adsorption, which translated to a level of O2/N2 selectivity that was only 1.5-fold higher than that at 30 °C.}

abstract = {Life satisfaction is adaptive, yet the antecedents of its adaptability require further exploration. Drawing from evolutionary psychology, this study aimed to investigate the adaptive mechanisms underlying happiness among adolescents, considering that adaptation involves subjective evaluation, including both first-order and second-order evaluations. Through a cross-sectional study (Study 1) and a longitudinal study (Study 2), this research examined the impact of subjective socioeconomic status on life satisfaction and the mediating roles of general and personal belief in a just world. Findings from both studies indicated that subjective socioeconomic status positively predicts life satisfaction. Moreover, it was the general belief in a just world, rather than the personal belief in a just world, that mediated this relationship. This study examined how evolutionary theory and second-order evaluation theory explain the impact of subjective socioeconomic status on life satisfaction, emphasizing the belief in a just world as a crucial adaptive belief mediating this relationship. We should emphasize the belief in a just world among adolescents with low subjective socioeconomic status, as a strategy to boost their long-term happiness. By fostering a sense of fairness and acceptance in adolescents' evaluations of their socioeconomic status, we can better promote their mental health and overall happiness.}

abstract = {Digital transformation is changing the innovation landscape, not only of firms but also at the macro level. This study aims to analyse how configurations of European Union countries’ innovation inputs that lead to innovation outputs are affected by the levels of national digital transformation. A novel configurational moderation approach is adopted to assess the impact of digital transformation on the 27 EU countries’ national systems of innovation (NSI). Results showed that the presence of all innovation inputs is a sufficient configuration for the presence of high innovation outputs, while three different configurations were found to be sufficient for its absence. The configurational moderation analysis revealed that digital transformation effectively moderates the arrangement of innovation inputs leading to the presence of high innovation outputs, where the human capital and research pillar loses its importance. The results of this study can be understood as benchmarks, against which less innovative countries may compare and develop their NSI. They also shed light on the specific configurations followed by each EU country in achieving innovation outputs, which could be an input for Union-based policies directed at the development of concrete innovation pillars in specific Member States. Furthermore, findings enlighten international business managers about the strengths and weaknesses of EU countries’ NSI, which may aid them in their internationalisation decisions.}

abstract = {Background
Radiation protective garments, commonly called lead aprons, are required to be worn by healthcare workers to reduce radiation exposure. There is growing evidence that wearing lead aprons may be associated with increased prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, which can result in ended careers or reduced capacities.
Methods
Keywords were identified using the PICO method and combined in searches using Boolean operators. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and using Ovid. Additional literature was identified using academic search engines and reference reviews. The PRISMA 2020 Statement guidelines were followed for article selection. Quality reviews were conducted on included studies using the LEGEND Evidence Evaluation System. A meta-analysis was then performed using calculated odds-ratios comparing musculoskeletal disorder prevalence in lead apron wearers against a baseline population prevalence.
Results
1,873 articles were identified in initial searches, which resulted in thirty-one included studies after screening. Included studies contained 8,280 participants with over 4,500 occurrences of musculoskeletal pain. The overall body of evidence quality was low. Four of six non-cross-sectional studies found a negative consequence of wearing lead aprons. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies resulted in a combined odds ratio of 3.83 (95 % CI: 2.67–5.48, p < 0.01), with I2 at 90 %. Studies from Asian countries indicated higher odds ratios than other regions. There were no statistical differences between the rate of individuals who felt that lead apron use caused their musculoskeletal disorder and the mean prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in lead apron wearers.
Conclusions
A significant potential of injury is associated with wearing lead aprons in healthcare settings. Ergonomic interventions, training, and strategies like those implemented by organizations that require body armor to be utilized, such as reduced wear times and reduced weight, should be considered to reduce the potential of injury.}

abstract = {On an industrial scale, producing a large amount of oxygen with high purity usually utilizes cryogenic air separation processes. Air separation units (ASUs) consume large amounts of electricity to produce oxygen. Therefore, ASUs with energy-saving processes are required. However, improvements of ASUs including reducing energy consumption by making use of only distillation have nearly reached the limit. Membrane separation, which can extract products consecutively without gas–liquid equilibrium limitation, is highly appreciated for integration with distillation to produce oxygen. However, oxygen permeation property at cryogenic temperature with membranes has not yet been clarified. This study investigates the oxygen separation property with membranes at low temperatures based on bis(triethoxysilyl)methane (BTESM) called bridged-type organosilica. Microporous structure is successfully controlled via calcination and the effectiveness of network pore size on oxygen separation properties is discussed. Oxygen selectivity (O2/Ar, O2/N2) increases as permeation temperature decreases, irrespective of the network pore size of BTESM membranes. Particularly, a BTESM membrane of network pore size 0.45 nm shows high oxygen selectivity (O2/Ar = 13.5, O2/N2 = 13.2) at −115 °C. In the case of an O2/He system, O2/He selectivity by binary separation is largely enhanced as O2/He selectivity by single permeation increases. Since high O2/He selectivity indicates a larger network pore size (less effective molecular sieving), preferentially adsorbed oxygen effectivity blocks He permeation. For the binary separation of O2/Ar and O2/N2 at −115 °C, oxygen selectivity by binary separation is approximately the same as that by single permeation due to the negligible difference in adsorption properties of oxygen, argon, and nitrogen.}

abstract = {Ankle motor control is crucial for balance maintenance and fall prevention. Neurocomputational models of motor control suggest that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays a critical role in estimating body and environmental states, a process fundamental to motor control. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) has been shown to modulate cortical excitability and alter behaviors accordingly. This study explored the impact of atDCS over the PPC on ankle tracking visuomotor control using a motor adaptation research paradigm in healthy young adults. Thirty-eight participants were randomly assigned to either an atDCS or sham control group. All participants completed an ankle tracking experiment divided into three phases: pre-adaptation, adaptation, and re-adaptation, with each phase comprising eight blocks of five trials. During the experiment, each participant wore a sensor on the non-dominant foot and performed continuous dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movements to track a target cursor on a screen. Visual feedback of the foot position was provided, with a 1:1 feedback ratio in the pre- and re-adaptation phases and a 2.5:1 ratio in the adaptation phase to promote visual-motor remapping. The atDCS group received 20 min of 2 mA atDCS over the PPC during the adaptation phase. Tracking performance on each trial was measured as the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the target and actual movement trajectories. Both groups showed similar RMSEs in the pre-adaptation phase (p > 0.05). However, in the adaptation phase, the atDCS group demonstrated a significant reduction from block 1 to block 2 (p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.86) and maintained this improved performance in the following blocks, while the sham group showed no significant changes throughout this phase (p > 0.05). In the re-adaptation phase, both groups quickly returned to their pre-adaptation performance levels. These findings indicate that neither the atDCS nor the sham group adapted to the high visual feedback ratio. However, the early reduction in RMSE observed in the atDCS group suggests that atDCS over the PPC may transiently enhance ankle tracking visuomotor control under the heightened visual feedback ratio condition, resulting in short-term improvements. Future research is warranted to explore whether multiple atDCS sessions over the PPC could provide long-term benefits for lower extremity visuomotor control.}

abstract = {Microbial communities inhabiting the gut of host species have been recognized as a significant factor influencing the success of aquaculture as they directly/indirectly control the overall physiology and biochemistry of the host. In terms of shrimp aquaculture, gut microbiome changes (i.e., periodic succession) during development phases and interacts with the host (i.e., shrimp), contributing to several physiological processes such as digestion, absorption of nutrients, intestinal homeostasis, inhibition of pathogens and more importantly immunity. Therefore, periodically analyzing gut microbiome can be considered an attractive proposal for shrimp aquaculture, especially shrimp health management. Any change in the normal microbial flora in the gut system of the host is termed “dysbiosis.” As for health management, utilizing probiotics paves the way for the restoration of a normal microbial community, which is termed “eubiosis.” However, screening, designing, and applying probiotics requires prior knowledge of the host microbiome. A proper understanding of the driving factors determining the selection and colonization of specific microbes in the gut is also essential. In this review, we have compiled the gut microbiome data of Penaeus monodon, which was reported from different geographical locations. Besides, we have integrated data on the sediment and rearing water microbiome of shrimp culture ponds reported from previous studies. In doing so, we have constructed the networking between gut, sediment, and water microbiota to determine the eubiosis or dysbiosis state-of-art for shrimp health. In addition, we propose an Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning (AI-DL) based approach for the identification of shrimp health status based on external anatomy features such as detection of disease symptoms and to take preventive measures by modulating gut microbiome to achieve sustainable shrimp production.}

abstract = {Introduction
Generative AI is revolutionizing patient education in healthcare, particularly through chatbots that offer personalized, clear medical information. Reliability and accuracy are vital in AI-driven patient education.
Research question
How effective are Large Language Models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, in delivering accurate and understandable patient education on lumbar disc herniation?
Material and methods
Ten Frequently Asked Questions about lumbar disc herniation were selected from 133 questions and were submitted to three LLMs. Six experienced spine surgeons rated the responses on a scale from “excellent” to “unsatisfactory,” and evaluated the answers for exhaustiveness, clarity, empathy, and length. Statistical analysis involved Fleiss Kappa, Chi-square, and Friedman tests.
Results
Out of the responses, 27.2% were excellent, 43.9% satisfactory with minimal clarification, 18.3% satisfactory with moderate clarification, and 10.6% unsatisfactory. There were no significant differences in overall ratings among the LLMs (p = 0.90); however, inter-rater reliability was not achieved, and large differences among raters were detected in the distribution of answer frequencies. Overall, ratings varied among the 10 answers (p = 0.043). The average ratings for exhaustiveness, clarity, empathy, and length were above 3.5/5.
Discussion and conclusion
LLMs show potential in patient education for lumbar spine surgery, with generally positive feedback from evaluators. The new EU AI Act, enforcing strict regulation on AI systems, highlights the need for rigorous oversight in medical contexts. In the current study, the variability in evaluations and occasional inaccuracies underline the need for continuous improvement. Future research should involve more advanced models to enhance patient-physician communication.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the country's substantial liver cancer burden, there is limited research on the factors influencing the place of death (POD) of patients with liver cancer in China. This study aimed to delineate POD distribution among patients with liver cancer, identify the factors associated with hospital deaths, and offer valuable insights for the government to develop healthcare policies.
Methods
Data from 2013 to 2020 were obtained from the National Mortality Surveillance System (NMSS) of China. This analysis focused on the distribution of POD among individuals who succumbed to liver cancer. Variations in characteristic distributions across different categories were evaluated using a chi-squared test. We also applied a multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with hospital liver cancer deaths. The proportional change in variance was computed to evaluate the contributions of different factors in the model.
Results
From 2013 to 2020, the NMSS reported a total of 608,789 liver cancer-related deaths, of which 440,079 (72.29%) died at home, and 158,291 (26.00%) died in the hospital. Home remained the preferred POD among patients with liver cancer. The results demonstrated that female patients, aged between 0 and 14 years, of Han ethnicity, living in urban areas, unmarried, highly educated, and either employed in a professional, staff, or civil servant capacity, or retired patients tended to end their lives in the hospital.
Conclusions
In China, home continues to be the predominant POD for patients with liver cancer, with demographic and socioeconomic factors significantly influencing whether a hospital is their POD. Enhancing healthcare policymakers' understanding of the factors influencing the place of death for patients with liver cancer may assist in creating a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources and providing a variety of choices for minorities with distinct preferences for end-of-life care.}
