abstract = {Background
In Spain, the prevalence of heart failure is twice the European average, partly due to inadequate patient management. To address this issue, a standardized care model, the Care Model for Patients with Heart Failure (Modelos Asistenciales de Atención al Paciente con Insuficiencia Cardíaca), was developed. This model emphasizes the importance of sequential visits from hospital discharge until the patient transitions to chronic care to prevent rehospitalization. The standardized care pathway has been implemented in certain areas of the Andalusia Health Service. However, there is uncertainty about whether the region’s electronic health record system, Diraya, can effectively support this model. If not properly integrated, it could lead to data inaccuracies and noncompliance with the standardized care pathway.
Objective
This study aimed to explore how to improve Diraya to better support health care professionals in adhering to the transition standardized care model for patients with heart failure as they move from hospital care to chronic care.
Methods
In total, 16 semistructured interviews were conducted with nurses and physicians from both hospital and primary care settings. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data and recommendations for improvements that were developed based on the findings. These recommendations were further supported by existing literature and validated through additional interviews.
Results
In total, 65 codes, 23 subthemes, and 8 themes were identified. The main themes included optimizing medical data management for enhanced clinical workflow, agreement on standardization and enhancement of the discharge report, enhancing clinical decision support through updated guidelines and automated tools, optimizing interoperability as a solution for better management of patients with heart failure, and encouraging communication based on digital tools and personal connection. In total, 15 improvements were proposed, such as standardizing technology across Andalusia Health Service facilities and offering targeted training programs. These measures aim to enhance interoperability, streamline communication between different health care settings, and reduce the administrative burden for health care professionals.
Conclusions
Diraya currently does not adequately support the transition standardized care model, placing a significant administrative burden on health care professionals, often with ethically concerning implications. To ensure effective implementation of the standardized care model, major updates are necessary for Diraya’s clinical information management, system functionality, and organizational structure within the Andalusia Health Service.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the ability of 15 different large language models (LLMs) to solve clinical cases with osteoarticular infections following published guidelines.
Materials and Methods
The study evaluated 15 LLMs across 5 categories of osteoarticular infections: periprosthetic joint infection, diabetic foot infection, native vertebral osteomyelitis, fracture-related infections, and septic arthritis. Models were selected systematically, including general-purpose and medical-specific systems, ensuring robust English support. In total, 126 text-based questions, developed by the authors from published guidelines and validated by experts, assessed diagnostic, management, and treatment strategies. Each model answered individually, with responses classified as correct or incorrect based on guidelines. All tests were conducted between April 17, 2025, and April 28, 2025. Results, presented as percentages of correct answers and aggregated scores, highlight performance trends. Mixed-effects logistic regression with a random question effect was used to quantify how each LLM compared in answering the study questions.
Results
The performance of 15 LLMs was evaluated, with the percentage of correct answers reported. OpenEvidence and Microsoft Copilot achieved the highest score (119/126 [94.4%]), excelling in multiple categories. ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro scored 117 of the 126 (92.8%). When used as references, OpenEvidence was not inferior to any comparator and was superior to 5 LLMs. Performance varied across categories, highlighting the strengths and limitations of individual models.
Conclusion
OpenEvidence and Miccrosoft Copilot achieved the highest accuracy among evaluated LLMs, highlighting their potential for precisely addressing complex clinical cases. This study emphasizes the need for specialized, validated artificial intelligence tools in medical practice. Although promising, current models face limitations in real-world applications, requiring further refinement to support clinical decision making reliably.}

Integrating LLMs into systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers potential solutions to current LLMs’ problems, like the generation of false or misleading information. The objective of this paper is to design and debate the value of an AI-driven system, similar to ChatGPT, to enhance the uptake of clinical guidance within the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK. Conversational interfaces, powered by LLMs, offer healthcare practitioners clear benefits over traditional ways of getting clinical guidance, such as easy navigation through long documents, blending information from various trusted sources, or expediting evidence-based decisions in situ. But, putting these interfaces into practice brings new challenges for HTA bodies, like assuring quality, addressing data privacy concerns, navigating existing resource constraints, or preparing the organization for innovative practices. Rigorous empirical evaluations are necessary to validate their effectiveness in increasing the uptake of clinical guidance among healthcare practitioners. A feasible evaluation strategy is elucidated in this research while its implementation remains as future work.}

abstract = {Background
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in vascular atherosclerosis and are involved in the pathophysiology of CAD. This study aimed to validate the associations of eight exosomal miRNAs with CAD and assess their relevance to disease severity.
Methods
A total of 875 participants who underwent elective coronary angiography were enrolled between January 2022 and August 2023. Blood samples were collected during angiography, and exosomal miRNAs were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Only miRNAs with detection rates above 50% and reproducible results were included. Differential expression was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann–Whitney U test), with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.
Results
Participants in the severe CAD group (with significant three-vessel disease) were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension than those in the non-CAD group (with patent coronary arteries). miRNA-382-3p was significantly upregulated in patients with severe CAD, correlating with the presence of disease. miRNA-3613-3p and miRNA-185-5p exhibited variable expression patterns, warranting further investigation. miRNA-200a-3p expression did not significantly differ between the groups, whereas miRNA-432-5p, miRNA-125a-5p, miRNA-151a-3p, and miRNA-328-3p had low detection rates, limiting their analytical utility.
Conclusions
miRNA-382-3p is associated with severe CAD and may contribute to understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic development. Further studies are necessary to validate its clinical significance and broader application.}

Initially seen as a cellular aging mechanism, it is now recognized for its roles in development, tissu repair and tumour suppression. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. Recent efforts have focused on “senotherapeutics”, including senolytics, which aim to eliminate senescent cells to mitigate age-related decline. Despite significant advances, senescence research faces critical challenges because of inconsistent detection methods. Common markers, such as p16INK4a and senescence-associated β-galactosidase, vary across tissues and contexts, complicating cross-study comparisons and clinical applications. A standardized multifaceted approach to senescence detection is essential, and should incorporate complementary methods, clear thresholds for senescence classification and considerations for cell type-specific variations. Such standardization would enhance reproducibility, streamline research and facilitate clinical translation, advancing therapeutic applications in aging and disease management.}

The effectiveness of this framework is verified through two classical composite design cases: isotropic and homogeneous laminates. The laminating rules proposed by the data-driven framework are proven to be reasonable and consistent with those in common laminate practices. This work demonstrates the great potential of artificial intelligence not only in guiding laminate design but also in providing new perspectives on discovering composite theory.}

The exact molecular mechanisms linking cell growth with DNA replication under different nutrient conditions remain elusive. However, recent studies in Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli have provided insights into the regulation of DNA replication initiation in response to starvation. These mechanisms include the starvation-dependent regulation of DnaA abundance as well as mechanisms involving the small signaling molecule (p)ppGpp. In this review, we discuss these mechanisms in the context of previous findings. We highlight species-dependent similarities and differences and consider the precise growth conditions, in which the different mechanisms are active.}

We examined contextual (i.e., autonomy-supportive leadership, autonomy-thwarting leadership), occupational experience (i.e., professional growth striving, change-related stress), and background factors (i.e., gender, age, teaching experience, contract length, class size, school level) as predictors of motivation (i.e., genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e., integration in teaching-related work and student learning activities). Among 339 Australian teachers, our findings revealed that perceived autonomy-supportive leadership, professional growth striving, and change-related stress were linked with greater genAI valuing. In turn, genAI valuing was associated with greater genAI integration in both teaching-related work and student learning activities. Perceived autonomy-thwarting leadership was directly linked with greater genAI integration in student learning activities, and professional growth striving was directly associated with greater genAI integration in teaching-related work. Teachers’ gender and school level were also linked with the motivation and engagement factors, and there were several indirect associations as well. Our results pinpoint areas of focus for future research, policy, and practice to support genAI and its application in schools.}

abstract = {This paper takes the occasion of French DJ David Guetta's use of generative AI tools to create lyrics and a voice in the style of Eminem, which he then used in one of his concerts, as the basis for an exploration of the shifting meaning of creativity and originality in the age of generative AI. Our main contention is that the Guetta form of creativity with generative AI tools differs in certain important respects from what has come before. The paper describes an iterative, dynamic process of conception, prompting, generation, refining, and deployment to characterise creativity in this context. Nevertheless, we contend that copyright – specifically the concept of originality as articulated in US federal law – is a sufficiently durable legal mechanism that can manage these new cultural forms, and that the two basic requirements of modern copyright law (a tangible medium of expression and a modest degree of creativity) remain relevant in identifying the scope of legal protection. The paper argues that the David Guetta story reveals something more general about creativity in a digital age, namely that while hybrid-networked (i.e., human – corporate – machine) creators have always created hybrid-networked cultural forms (i.e., creations that blend human and technology-constituted elements), such hybridity becomes increasingly visible and complex in the context of a new world of generative AI. At the very least, earlier – and influential – models of creativity as human-driven involving creation ex nihilo become harder to sustain in a new age of generative AI. But this does not mean copyright or notions of originality are redundant or that copyright law cannot accommodate Guetta and other cases. Such an account seems important as it challenges the hegemonic and reductive view that AI “generates” artistic works autonomously and avoids reducing the copyright issues raised by such creative works to the related but distinct question of whether learning models rely on copyrighted data. As such, copyright law should remain an important mechanism to facilitate genuine creators who are using AI systems in innovative and unique ways to push the boundaries of their creativity.}

Health systems globally are facing huge challenges to deal with the ever-growing numbers of non-communicable diseases (NCD’s), the majority of which are lifestyle associated. In the Irish context, 1.07million people have one or more chronic diseases, 76% of deaths are attributed to chronic disease and there is a 4% increase in chronic disease each year (Healthy Ireland Survey 2015: Summary of findings, 2021).Patients with RA have co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension (Pranata et al 2020). Lifestyle choices such as smoking have been shown to reduce treatment response (Aimer et al 2020). Cornelissen et al (2021) exploring what matters to patients with RA when facing medical decisions, patients emphasised the value of healthy lifestyle and keeping up their physical fitness.
Objectives:
To produce an evidence based booklet to support the patient and the clinician to incorporate lifestyle medicine into rheumatology clinical care.
Methods:
Funding was secured via a nursing bursary award. The project lead, brought together a team of seven experts including nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, substance misuse, health coaching and patients. The group collaborated with a design expert to conceptualize the booklet, key messages, tone and brand. Each healthcare professional created content for each lifestyle pillar according to their expertise. Patient feedback informed change through the process.
Results:
The booklet facilities lifestyle changes with a range of tools to activate patient participation to identify and address small changes in each pillar and their relationship with arthritis. Bridges self-management tools and language is a theme through all six pillars offering person centred techniques to facilitate and guide individual behaviour change meaningful to each patient.
Conclusion:
Lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on health and arthritis. By using the principles of lifestyle medicine patients have the potential to adapt and sustain positive lifestyle changes and live their best life with arthritis.

This retrospective, single-center study included 175 MASLD patients in our university medical center. The diagnostic performance of FIB-4, APRI, and NFS for advanced fibrosis (stage 3–4) was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with de novo cirrhosis and survival outcomes.
Results
The mean age was 49.9±14.1 years, and 54.9% were female. The median follow-up was 78 months. ROC analysis showed FIB-4 (AUC: 0.77) was the best predictor of advanced fibrosis, followed by APRI (AUC: 0.74) and NFS (AUC: 0.74). Multivariate analysis identified fibrosis stage (HR: 3.045, p=0.001) and hypertension (HR: 4.096, p=0.047) as independent predictors of de novo cirrhosis. Age (HR: 1.070, p=0.031), albumin (HR: 15.151, p<0.001), and HbA1c (HR: 1.589, p<0.001) were independently associated with survival.
Conclusion
FIB-4 was the most accurate predictor of advanced fibrosis. Fibrosis stage and hypertension were the strongest predictors of de novo cirrhosis. These findings highlight the importance of fibrosis staging and comorbidity management in MASLD.}

This is made more complex by the interpretation and actions as a result of this conclusion having direct impact on the sum of the component systems, the human, thereby integrating significant social and psychological considerations into an already complex situation. As higher education educators, it is a significant challenge to provide our learners with training and most importantly, practice, in these knowledge, skills and behaviours in the classroom. There has been a significant interest in recent years in providing active learning opportunities which allow learners to apply subject knowledge to multi-faceted, immersive, continuously evolving stories which reflect a graduate's professional aspirations. This review highlights practices from the literature of storytelling education which the higher education educator can utilise in promoting “meaning making” in the classroom. Here, the case for interactive storytelling in physiology and clinical education is argued, as well as presenting commonly utilised techniques and practices with which educators can embed storytelling into their pedagogy as well as highlighting future directions in this field.}

abstract = {Background/Objective
To summarize the results of Chile's 2022 Report Card (RC) on physical activity (PA) for Children and Adolescents.
Methods
Chile's 2022 RC included ten core PA indicators common to the Global Matrix 4.0. Evidence from scientific articles, reports, and databases published between 2018 and January 2022 was included for each indicator. The data were collected and analyzed by a national scientific committee, which assigned letter grades (A to F) using a consensus based on benchmarks defined and revised by the Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance.
Results
The committee assigned the following grades: Overall PA, D−; Organized Sports and Physical Activity Participation, C−; Active Play, Incomplete; Active Transportation, D; Sedentary Behavior, D−; Physical Fitness, Incomplete; Family and Peers, D; School, C; Community and Environment, D+; Government, A−.
Conclusions
Chile's 2022 RC, like its previous versions, shows persistently low grades for most indicators. Overall PA remained nearly unchanged, while Community and Environment scored lower. Slight improvements were seen in Organized Sports, Family and Peers, and School Environment. While Chile has endeavored to increase children's activity levels, policies require implementation through a systemic, coherent framework to promote sustainable changes and reach a larger portion of children and youth.}

abstract = {Background
Total hip arthroplasty is the preferred treatment for advanced hip osteoarthritis, yet complications like hip dislocation (0.2 %–10 %) persist due to factors such as implant design, positioning, surgical technique, and patient-specific conditions. Impingement between prosthetic components or the acetabulum and proximal femur is a primary cause of instability.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of 120 patients (130 hips) undergoing total hip arthroplasty at XX Hospital (2011−2023) categorized patients by lateral center-edge angle: developmental dysplasia of the hip, borderline developmental dysplasia of the hip, and normal hip. ct imaging facilitated virtual 3D bone models for motion analysis, excluding cases with prior hip surgery or spinal fusion. Statistical analyses utilized the Mann–Whitney U test and one-way ANOVA.
Findings
The developmental dysplasia of the hip group showed the highest posterior impingement frequency, significantly affecting range of motion in flexion, adduction, and external rotation compared to borderline developmental dysplasia of the hip and normal hip groups. Variations in femoral neck anteversion, lesser trochanter version, and ischiofemoral space were notable. Posterior impingement commonly occurred between the lesser trochanter and ischial tuberosity.
Interpretation
Posterior bony impingement emerged as a predominant factor reducing range of motion and increasing dislocation risk, particularly in developmental dysplasia of the hip patients, challenging the conventional “safe zone” for implant positioning. Personalized surgical strategies tailored to individual bone morphology are crucial for enhancing total hip arthroplasty outcomes and minimizing complications, although limitations include the exclusion of soft tissue influences and focusing solely on range of motion until impingement occurs.}

Although chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is effective in advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its efficacy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations remains unclear.
Methods
This retrospective analysis included 66 patients: 28 received chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, and 38 received chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was safety. In eligible patients with measurable disease, tumor response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. PFS was defined as the time from the first day of therapy to disease progression.or death from any cause.
Results
The median progression–free survival (mPFS) was 10.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.03—16.63 months) in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group and 6.23 months (95% CI: 4.53—7.07 months) in the chemotherapy alone group. There was a significant difference in efficacy between the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy and chemotherapy-alone groups (p < 0.001). Among the 25 patients evaluated for tumor response in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group, 11 (44%) achieved a partial response (PR), 8 (32%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (24%) had progressive disease (PD). The objective response rate (ORR) was 44%. Adverse events (AEs) included gastrointestinal reactions and myelosuppression. There were no significant differences in terms of safety between the two treatment groups.
Conclusions
First-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy was associated with significantly longer PFS than chemotherapy alone in patients with EGFR ex20ins-mutant NSCLC, without increased toxicity.}

abstract = {Objective
This review seeks to deepen our understanding of the factors contributing to nursing students' academic dishonesty and the repercussions of such behaviours on their learning in both classroom and clinical settings, and on the integrity of the nursing profession.
Design and methods
It was a scoping review in which a five-stage methodological framework informed its process. Six databases were searched for relevant original studies. Other search methods were also conducted using Google Scholar, Trove, and ProQuest Dissertations for theses pertinent to the topic. An inductive descriptive approach was used to analyse and synthesise data.
Results
Twenty-seven studies and nine doctoral theses were selected and included in the scoping review. Of these, 25 studies used a quantitative approach, nine studies a qualitative one, and two studies used mixed methods. Three categorical factors, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and external, contributed to nursing students' academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
Academic dishonesty in nursing students is concerning. Noted factors contributing to academic dishonesty include stress and pressure experienced by students, the prevalence of peer cheating, and lack of knowledge. Most alarming is the significant correlation between academic dishonesty and clinical dishonesty. The evidence suggests that students who engage in dishonest behaviour in academic settings may be more likely to engage in dishonest behaviour in clinical settings. This raises serious concerns about integrity, ethics, patient safety and the reputation of nursing students, universities, healthcare providers and health professionals.}

abstract = {Background
Falls represent a significant health burden among individuals with diabetes, yet the long-term relationship between diabetes status and fall risk remains inadequately characterized in Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the association between diabetes status and incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults using nationally representative longitudinal data.
Methods
Utilizing China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011–2020 data, we included 9553 participants (aged ≥45 years) for a 9-year prospective cohort study. Diabetes was classified as normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or diabetes based on self-reported diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), or HbA1c levels. Incident falls were assessed via self-reports across four survey waves from 2011 to 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were to evaluate the independent association between diabetes and falls and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Results
The study included 7131 (74.6 %) participants with normal glucose levels, 1254 (13.1 %) with prediabetes, and 1168 (12.2 %) with diabetes. Mean age was 58.1 ± 9.0 years, with 46.9 % males. Fall incidence rates were significantly higher in the diabetes group (55.1 %) compared to prediabetes (48.3 %) and normal glucose groups (47.3 %) (P < 0.001). After full adjustment for potential confounders, diabetes was associated with a 27 % increased risk of incident falls (OR=1.27, 95 % CI: 1.11–1.45, P < 0.001), while prediabetes showed no significant association (OR=0.99, 95 % CI: 0.87–1.12, P = 0.817). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations in older adults aged ≥60 years (OR=1.45, 95 % CI: 1.18–1.78) compared to those <60 years (OR=1.17, 95 % CI: 0.98–1.39), with similar effects in both sexes. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.
Conclusions
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults, with a 27 % higher risk persisting after comprehensive adjustment. This association appears to be specific to established diabetes rather than prediabetes, suggesting a pathophysiological threshold effect. The findings support the integration of fall prevention strategies into routine diabetes care, particularly for older adults, and have important implications for clinical practice guidelines and public health policy in China's rapidly aging population.}

Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV & Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability. The study opens avenues for further research into multimodal learning in industry applications.}

Radium-223 (Ra-223) treatment is used to extend the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with bone metastases. However, the optimal timing for its administration remains ambiguous. Hence, this study aimed to determine the optimal timing for Ra-223 administration.
Materials and methods
We retrospectively included Japanese men with mCRPC with bone metastases who were treated with Ra-223. The primary endpoint was OS from Ra-223 treatment. Secondary endpoints included the maximum reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and the incidence of adverse events following Ra-223 treatment. The exploratory endpoint was the association between clinical parameters and OS.
Results
Overall, 100 men with mCRPC with bone metastasis treated with Ra-223 wereenrolled. The median OS from the Ra-223 treatment was 38.6 months. Post Ra-223 treatment, ALP, LDH, and PSA levels decreased in 78.6%, 56.1%, and 44.9% of patients, respectively. Grade ≥3 anemia occurred in three (4.1%) patients. The median OS of patients with ≥10 months from diagnosis to developing mCRPC (52.4 months, P < 0.014), a PSA doubling time ≥3 months (52.4 months, P = 0.035), prior docetaxel (DOC) treatment (108.2 months, P = 0.002), five or less numbers of bone metastasis (97.9 months, P = 0.006), five or more cycles of Ra-223 treatment (46.1 months, P = 0.045), hemoglobin measuring ≥13.1 g/dl (52.4 months, P = 0.003), ALP measuring ≤260 (54.8 months, P = 0.003), or LDH measuring ≤220 (46.1 months, P = 0.002) was significantly longer than that of those who had <10 months from diagnosis to developing mCRPC, a PSA doubling time <3 months, absence of prior DOC treatment, more than five bone metastasis, less than four cycles of Ra-223 treatment, hemoglobin measuring <13.1 g/dl, ALP measuring >260, or LDH measuring >220. Multivariate analysis showed that prior DOC administration prolonged the OS.
Conclusions
Ra-223 treatment is safe and effective for mCRPC.}

In parallel, existing industry regulations, such as GDPR, MIFID II or SM&CR, are being “retrofitted” and reinterpreted from the perspective of AI. In this paper we identify and analyze ten novel, “second generation” themes which are likely to become regulatory considerations in the near future: non-personal data, managerial accountability, robo-advisory, generative AI, privacy enhancing techniques (PETs), profiling, emergent behaviours, smart contracts, ESG and algorithm management. The themes have been identified on the basis of ongoing developments in AI, existing regulations and industry discussions. Prior to making any new regulatory recommendations we explore whether novel issues can be solved by existing regulations. The contribution of this paper is a comprehensive picture of emerging regulatory considerations for AI in investment management, as well as broader financial services, and the ways they might be addressed by regulations – future or existing ones.}

Background
The purpose of the study was to evaluate both the accuracy and reproducibility of the answers given by ChatGPT-4o®, Gemini® and Copilot® to frequently asked questions about pediatric primary enuresis nocturna.
Methods
Forty frequently asked questions about primary nocturnal enuresis were asked 2 times, one week apart, on ChatGPT-4o, Gemini and Copilot. One of each pediatric surgeon and nephrologist independently scored the answers into 4 groups: comprehensive/correct (1), incomplete/partially correct (2), a mix of accurate and inaccurate/misleading (3), and completely inaccurate/irrelevant (4). The accuracy and reproducibility of each chatbots answers were evaluated.
Results
In comparison of these most common used chatbots, the order of completely correct response rates from highest to lowest was Chat GPT-4o and followed by Copilot and Gemini. With an accuracy percentage of 92.5 %, ChatGPT-4o gave the most accurate responses of any AI chatbot. Gemini answered 50 % of questions correctly. Copilot was the weakest successful chatbot in answering questions about enuresis nocturna with 45 % of completely accurate answer ratio. Besides Copilot has a ratio of 2.5 % for completely inaccurate/irrelevant response. Reproducibility of ChatGPT-4o, Gemini and Copilots were 85 %, 77.5 %, 70 % respectively.
Conclusion
ChatGPT-4o is more successful in providing a high percentage of accurate responses regarding nocturnal enuresis. Both patients and their parents can use it, especially for simple, low-complexity medical questions. However, it should be used alongside expert healthcare proffesional.}

abstract = {Background
In 2017, Burgel and colleagues developed an algorithm to identify clinical phenotypes that predict mortality in COPD. Our study aimed to 1) investigate whether the phenotypes can predict acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and 2) validate their ability to predict mortality.
Methods
The Tools Identifying Exacerbations (TIE) cohort study recruited participants with spirometry-verified COPD from primary and secondary care in three Swedish regions. Participants were allocated to phenotypes 1–5 using the previously developed algorithm containing comorbidities (heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and/or diabetes), dyspnoea, age, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and body mass index (BMI). Data on AECOPDs and deaths during the three-year follow-up were collected from medical records and analysed with Cox proportional hazards regressions. Harrel's C-index was used to assess the models' discriminative ability.
Results
Among the 566 participants, 59 % were female, and the mean ± SD FEV1 was 57 ± 18 % of predicted. The hazard ratios (HRs) [95 % CI] for time to AECOPD were 3.04 [1.93–4.79], 2.38 [1.54–3.66], and 3.52 [1.73–7.15] in phenotypes 1, 2, and 4 compared with 5 (C-index = 0.61). When AECOPD history was used to predict future AECOPD the C-index was 0.65. The HRs [95 % CI] for mortality were 8.24 [1.93–35.3], 6.26 [1.40–28.0], and 16.7 [3.25–86.3] in phenotypes 1, 3, and 4 compared to 5 (C-index = 0.68). For AECOPD history, the C-index was 0.55.
Conclusion
Clinical COPD phenotypes based on comorbidities, dyspnoea, age, FEV1, and BMI predict AECOPDs but do not perform better than AECOPD history. However, they perform better than AECOPD history in predicting mortality.}

Moreover, the accuracy of extracting glacier boundaries from a single remote sensing image (RSIs) is often influenced by seasonal snow, clouds, shadows, and frozen lakes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model for extracting the non-debris-covered areas of glaciers (NDCAG) from RSIs, termed GlacierSTR-UNet. This model enhances information flow and overall performance by embedding the Swin Transformer (ST) as an encoder into a U-shaped architecture and reduces training time and improves gradient handling by incorporating the ResNet block in the decoder. We deploy the GlacierSTR-UNet model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently generate multiple NDCAG results from RSIs taken at different periods. A pixel-by-pixel synthesis algorithm is then applied to aggregate the multiple NDCAG extraction results, producing the final NDCAG. Accuracy assessments indicate that GlacierSTR-UNet achieves an overall accuracy of 0.8817, and the relative deviation between automatically extracted and manually interpreted NDCAG remains within 2 %. Finally, we obtain the NDCAG datasets for the periods of 2015/2016 and 2022/2023 in High-Mountain Asia, revealing a reduction of 4,185.12 ± 7,870.96 km2 in NDCAG from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently and accurately extracting NDCAG, highlighting its potential for monitoring glacier changes and supporting glacier inventory efforts.}

abstract = {Background
Online accessible patient education materials (PEMs) are essential for patient empowerment. However, studies have shown that these materials often exceed the recommended sixth-grade reading level, making them difficult for many patients to understand. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to simplify PEMs into more readable educational content.
Objective
We sought to evaluate whether 3 LLMs (ChatGPT [OpenAI], Gemini [Google], and Claude [Anthropic PBC]) can optimize the readability of PEMs to the recommended reading level without compromising accuracy.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used 60 randomly selected PEMs available online from 3 websites. We prompted LLMs to simplify the reading level of online PEMs. The primary outcome was the readability of the original online PEMs compared with the LLM-simplified versions. Readability scores were calculated using 4 validated indices Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Index. Accuracy and understandability were also assessed as balancing measures, with understandability measured using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool-Understandability (PEMAT-U).
Results
The original readability scores for the American Heart Association (AHA), American Cancer Society (ACS), and American Stroke Association (ASA) websites were above the recommended sixth-grade level, with mean grade level scores of 10.7,10.0, and 9.6, respectively. After optimization by the LLMs, readability scores significantly improved across all 3 websites when compared with the original text. Compared with the original website, Wilcoxon signed rank test showed ChatGPT improved the readability to 7.6 from 10.1 (P<.001); Gemini, to 6.6 (P<.001); and Claude, to 5.6 (P<.001). Word counts were significantly reduced by all LLMs, with a decrease from a mean range of 410.9-953.9 words to a mean range of 201.9-248.1 words. None of the ChatGPT LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate, while 3.3% of Gemini and Claude LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate. Baseline understandability scores, as measured by PEMAT-U, were preserved across all LLM-simplified versions.
Conclusions
This cross-sectional study demonstrates that LLMs have the potential to significantly enhance the readability of online PEMs while maintaining accuracy and understandability, making them more accessible to a broader audience. However, variability in model performance and demonstrated inaccuracies underscore the need for human review of LLM output. Further study is needed to explore advanced LLM techniques and models trained for medical content.}

abstract = {Background
Several studies have highlighted the synergistic effects of immunotherapy and radiotherapy on local and abscopal tumor control. However, data regarding the use of first-line immunochemotherapy (ICT) combined with radiotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are scarce. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line immunochemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (ICRT) and those of ICT alone.
Methods
Patients with advanced NSCLC who received first-line anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy plus chemotherapy at Wuhan Union Hospital and Hunan Cancer Hospital between October 2017 and July 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety associated with treatment were assessed. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.
Results
A total of 194 patients were included: 92 were treated with ICRT and 102 were treated with ICT. The ORRs of the ICRT and ICT groups were 57.6% and 47.1%, respectively. Patients in the ICRT group had significantly longer PFS (median: 14.9 vs. 11.5 months; P = 0.035) and OS (median: 41.3 vs. 23.1 months; P = 0.047) than those of patients in the ICT group. Patients treated with thoracic radiotherapy, those treated with extrathoracic metastasis radiotherapy, and those treated without radiotherapy had median PFS of 21.5 months, 12.9 months, and 11.5 months (P = 0.031); and the median OS were not reached, 41.3 months, and 23.1 months (P = 0.007), respectively. ICRT and ICT were generally well-tolerated, and the overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the groups. A total of 2.2% (2/92) of patients experienced grade 3 or grade 4 radiation-related adverse events.
Conclusions
Radiotherapy is safe and manageable when added to first-line anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.}

A simple and rapid assay for assessing bacterial biomass in these water samples was essential, particularly in situations where access to laboratory facilities was limited. The bacterial endotoxin test (BET) using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test was established as an effective method. However, the application of BET employing Carcinoscorpius or Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate (CAL/TAL), derived from Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda and Tachypleus gigas, remained rarely performed. This study aimed to explore the CAL and TAL potential for detecting bacterial endotoxins in milk and groundwater. In this assay, 94 blood samples of horseshoe crabs collected from the Banyuasin Waters of South Sumatra (79 samples of C. rotundicauda and 15 samples of T. gigas) were used. The assay was carried out using the gel-clot method. The results revealed that the CAL and TAL were able to detect small concentrations of endotoxin (up to a concentration of 0.0156 EU/mL) in raw milk, pasteurized milk, well water, and L1 HPV 52 protein based on the gel-clot test. Both CAL and TAL could be a potential substitute for the LAL assay, especially for detecting bacterial biomass in milk and groundwater. Furthermore, these findings were essential as initial scientific information for developing the CAL/TAL tests toward the development of recombinant Factor C (rFC).}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4 (CG4) are proving to be valuable tools in the medical field, not only in facilitating administrative tasks, but in augmenting medical decision-making. LLMs have previously been tested for diagnostic accuracy with expert-generated questions and standardized test data. Among those studies, CG4 consistently outperformed alternative LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5 (now no longer publicly available for use) and Google Bard (now known as “Google Gemini”). The next logical step was to begin to explore CG4’s accuracy within a specific clinical domain. Our study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CG4 within an inpatient neurology consultation service.
Methods
We conducted a review of all patients listed on the daily neurology consultation roster at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, CA, for all days surveyed until we reached a total of 51 patients, ensuring a complete and representative sample of the patient population. ChatGPT-4, using HIPAA-compliant methodology, received patient data from the Epic EHR as input and was asked to provide an initial differential diagnoses list, investigations and recommended actions, a final diagnosis, and a treatment plan for each patient. A comprehensiveness scale (an ordinal scale between 0 and 3) was then used to rate match accuracy between consultant and CG4 initial diagnoses and the consultants’ final diagnoses. In this proof-of-concept study, we assumed that the neurology consultants’ final diagnoses were accurate. We employed a non-parametric bootstrap resampling method to create 95 % confidence intervals around mean scores, a Fisher’s Exact test, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, and ordinal logistic regression models to compare the performance between consultant and CG4 groups.
Findings
Our study found that CG4 demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of consultant neurologists. The most frequent comprehensiveness score achieved by both groups was "3," with consultant neurologists achieving this score 43 times and CG4 achieving it 31 times. The mean comprehensiveness scores were 2.75 (95 % CI: 2.49–2.90) for the consultant group and 2.57 (95 % CI: 2.31–2.67) for the CG4 group. The success rate for comprehensive diagnoses (a score of "2″ or "3″) was 94.1 % (95 % CI: 84.1%–98.0 %) for consultants and 96.1 % (95 % CI: 86.8%–98.9 %) for CG4, with no statistically significant difference in success rates (p = 1.00). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test indicated that the consultant group had a higher likelihood of providing more comprehensive diagnoses (W = 1583, p = 0.02). Ordinal logistic regression models identified significant predictors of diagnostic accuracy, with the consultant diagnosis group showing an odds ratio of 3.68 (CI 95 %: 1.28–10.55) for higher value outcomes. Notably, integrating CG4’s initial diagnoses with those from consultants could achieve comprehensive diagnostics in all cases, indicating a number needed to treat (NNT) of 17 to attain one additional comprehensive diagnosis.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that CG4 can serve as a valuable diagnostic tool within the domain of inpatient neurology, providing comprehensive and accurate initial diagnoses comparable to those of consultant neurologists. The use of CG4 might contribute to better patient outcomes by serving as an aid in diagnosis and treatment recommendations, potentially leading to reduced missed diagnoses and quicker diagnostic processes. Continuous strategies and evaluations to improve LLMs' accuracy remain crucial. Further studies with larger sample sizes and independent third-party evaluations are recommended to confirm these findings and assess the impact of LLMs on patient health.}

abstract = {Background
With the climbing incidence of type 2 diabetes, the health care system is under pressure to manage patients with this condition properly. Particularly, pharmacological therapy constitutes the most fundamental means of controlling blood glucose levels and preventing the progression of complications. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by factors such as treatment complexity, polypharmacy, and poor patient adherence. As new technologies, artificial intelligence and digital technologies are covering all aspects of the medical and health care field, but their application and evaluation in the domain of diabetes research remain limited.
Objective
This study aims to develop and establish a stand-alone diabetes management service system designed to enhance self-management support for patients, as well as to assess its performance with experienced health care professionals.
Methods
Diabetes Universal Medication Schedule (DUMS) system is grounded in official medicine instructions and evidence-based data to establish medication constraints and drug-drug interaction profiles. Individualized medication schedules and self-management programs were generated based on patient-specific conditions and needs, using an app framework to build patient-side contact pathways. The system’s ability to provide medication guidance and health management was assessed by senior health care professionals using a 5-point Likert scale across 3 groups: outputs generated by the system (DUMS group), outputs refined by pharmacists (intervention group), and outputs generated by ChatGPT-4 (GPT-4 group).
Results
We constructed a cloud-based drug information management system loaded with 475 diabetes treatment–related medications; 684 medication constraints; and 12,351 drug-drug interactions and theoretical supports. The generated personalized medication plan and self-management program included recommended dosing times, disease education, dietary considerations, and lifestyle recommendations to help patients with diabetes achieve correct medication use and active disease management. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the DUMS group outperformed the GPT-4 group in medication schedule accuracy and safety, as well as comprehensiveness and richness of the self-management program (P<.001). The intervention group outperformed the DUMS and GPT-4 groups on all indicator scores.
Conclusions
DUMS’s treatment monitoring service can provide reliable self-management support for patients with diabetes. ChatGPT-4, powered by artificial intelligence, can act as a collaborative assistant to health care professionals in clinical contexts, although its performance still requires further training and optimization.}

abstract = {Background
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to provide early COVID-19 treatment for people at high risk of severe illness and to limit the spread of infection in society. Proper upper respiratory specimen collection is the most critical step in the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in public settings, and throat swabs were the preferred specimens used for mass testing in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is still a discussion about whether throat swabs have a high enough sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, as previous studies have reported a large variability in the sensitivity from 52% to 100%. Many previous studies exploring the diagnostic accuracy of throat swabs lack a detailed description of the sampling technique, which makes it difficult to compare the different diagnostic accuracy results. Some studies perform a throat swab by only collecting specimens from the posterior oropharyngeal wall, while others also include a swab of the palatine tonsils for SARS-CoV-2 testing. However, studies suggest that the palatine tonsils could have a tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2 that may improve the SARS-CoV-2 detection during sampling. This may explain the variation of sensitivity reported, but no clinical studies have yet explored the differences in sensitivity and patient discomfort whether the palatine tonsils are included during the throat swab or not.
Objective
The objective of this study is to examine the sensitivity and patient discomfort of a throat swab including the palatine tonsils compared to only swabbing the posterior oropharyngeal wall in molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
We will conduct a randomized controlled study to compare the molecular detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 by a throat swab performed from the posterior oropharyngeal wall and the palatine tonsils (intervention group) or the posterior oropharyngeal wall only (control group). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. All participants fill out a baseline questionnaire upon enrollment in the trial, examining their reason for being tested, symptoms, and previous tonsillectomy. A follow-up questionnaire will be sent to participants to explore the development of symptoms after testing.
Results
A total of 2315 participants were enrolled in this study between November 10, 2022, and December 22, 2022. The results from the follow-up questionnaire are expected to be completed at the beginning of 2024.
Conclusions
This randomized clinical trial will provide us with information about whether throat swabs including specimens from the palatine tonsils will improve the diagnostic sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection. These results can, therefore, be used to improve future testing recommendations and provide additional information about tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2.

abstract = {Background/purpose(s)
Staphylococcus aureus overgrowth contributes to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) through biofilm formation, bacterial invasion, and immune evasion. These factors lead to persistent infections and complications, especially in cases of refractory CRS. This study examines baicalein's effects on bacterial virulence and host responses using Calu-3 cells as an in vitro testing platform.
Methods
Baicalein's effects on S. aureus-induced epithelial damage were evaluated in a Calu-3 cell co-culture model. The analyses included bacterial clumping, biofilm formation, internalization, tight junction integrity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and key signaling pathways.
Results
Baicalein inhibited bacterial clumping, biofilm formation, and internalization by downregulating key virulence genes (fnbpA, fnbpB, clfB, rot, sarA, and icaR). It also suppressed the Agr and LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing systems, which regulate virulence and biofilm development. In host cells, baicalein reduced S. aureus-induced apoptosis by modulating the PI3K/Akt pathway and attenuated oxidative stress and autophagy. Furthermore, it restored epithelial barrier integrity by preserving ZO-1 localization.
Conclusion
Baicalein demonstrates potential as an alternative therapeutic strategy for reducing CRS recurrence and minimizing prolonged antibiotic use by effectively targeting S. aureus virulence and disrupting bacterial communication. This approach offers a promising solution for managing CRS and reducing reliance on antibiotics.}

keywords = {Pediatric thyroid nodules, Diagnostic criteria},
abstract = {Purpose
Thyroid nodules are uncommon in children and adolescents but carry an increased risk of malignancy when present. The Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) is an adult-validated ultrasound-based risk assessment providing a prediction of malignant potential for thyroid nodules, thereby guiding recommendations for fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Minimal data exist regarding the applicability of TI-RADS to predict malignancy in pediatric thyroid nodules. This study aims to analyze the performance of TI-RADS for children and adolescents with thyroid nodules, hypothesizing that applying TI-RADS criteria would improve accuracy and reduce the number of recommended FNAB compared to American Thyroid Association (ATA) size criteria alone.
Methods
A multi-institutional retrospective analysis was conducted including patients ≤21 years with a thyroid nodule by sonographic thyroid imaging between 2015 and 2020. TI-RADS scores were assigned at each institution by a pediatric radiologist trained in thyroid imaging and TI-RADS criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy of TI-RADS scoring were compared to existing ATA size-based recommendation for performing a FNAB. Accounting for relative size differences between adults and children, a novel PED TI-RADS category was developed and tested, recommending FNAB for thyroid nodules with a TI-RADS 3 and ≥ 1.5 cm, TI-RADS 4 and ≥ 1.0 cm, and TI-RADS 5 any feasible size.
Results
291 nodules from 260 patients (median age 14.9 years, 78.8% female) were assessed using TI-RADS. Applying adult TI-RADS criteria resulted in recommendation of FNAB for 35.1% of nodules, in contrast to 76.6% recommended by ATA guidelines (p < 0.0001) (Table). Utilizing the adult TI-RADS score ≥3 as an FNAB indicator resulted in 100% sensitivity and 28.5% specificity, with 0 cases of missed malignant nodules on pathology. When novel PED TI-RADS criteria were applied, 88 patients would have been spared an unnecessary FNAB with improved sensitivity and accuracy over ATA criteria.
Conclusions
The application of adult and PED TI-RADS scoring to thyroid nodules in pediatric patients enhances the accuracy of malignancy prediction compared to current American Thyroid Association size criteria alone. The utilization of PED TI-RADS scoring eliminated unnecessary biopsies in many children while not missing a single thyroid malignancy.
Level of Evidence

Myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) and myositis-associated antibodies (MAAs) are assessed in clinical neurology, serving as a non-invasive tool for the differential diagnosis of autoimmune myopathies. However, the presence of MSAs and MAAs in neurological disorders remains uncertain.
Methods
Retrospective analysis was conducted on 878 serum samples from the neurological laboratory of the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany. The EUROLINE Myositis Profil 3 (IgG) Line Blot was used for antibody evaluation (anti-Mi2, -Ku, -PM-Scl100, -PM-Scl75, -Jo1, -SRP, -PL7, -PL12, -EJ, -OJ, and -Ro52). Samples were categorized into 19 disease groups, with consideration for myositis-linked and non-myositis-linked diseases. Then, the distribution of positive findings and the concurrent presence of more than one MAA/MSA were analyzed.
Results
Among 727 included line blots, 84 could be assigned to myositis-linked diseases (thereof 44 positive for MAA/MSA). MAA and MSA taken together were more frequently positive for the main group of myositis-linked disease (52.4 %) compared to the non-myositis-linked group (14.6 %, overall specificity 85.4 %). However, individual antibodies were specific, ranging above 97.5 %. False positive antibody results can also occur in neurological differential diagnoses such as muscle dystrophy or cramp fasciculation syndrome. Furthermore, the concurrent presence of more than one MAA/MSA does not show a significant association with the presence of a myositis-linked disease for antibody-positive samples (p = 0.136).
Discussion
Testing MSA and MAA simultaneously may not be suitable as a primary screening method for myositis-linked diseases in clinical neurological groups. However, MSAs and MAAs may offer valuable diagnostic support, particularly in cases where myositis is strongly considered.}

Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular and are playing an important role in providing accurate clinical information to both patients and physicians. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4.0, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot LLMs for responding to patient questions regarding refractive surgery.
Methods
The LLMs’ responses to 25 questions about refractive surgery, which are frequently asked by patients, were evaluated by two ophthalmologists using a 5-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. Furthermore, the DISCERN scale was used to assess the reliability of the language models’ responses, whereas the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level indices were used to evaluate readability.
Results
Significant differences were found among all three LLMs in the Likert scores (p = 0.022). Pairwise comparisons revealed that ChatGPT-4.0′s Likert score was significantly higher than that of Microsoft Copilot, while no significant difference was found when compared to Google Gemini (p = 0.005 and p = 0.087, respectively). In terms of reliability, ChatGPT-4.0 stood out, receiving the highest DISCERN scores among the three LLMs. However, in terms of readability, ChatGPT-4.0 received the lowest score.

abstract = {Background
Rural individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) experience challenges to anticoagulation adherence and self-management of the condition. We tested an intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, quality of life, and health care utilization in rural individuals with AF.
Methods
We randomized rural patients with AF receiving anticoagulation to receive a smartphone-based relational agent (for disease education and adherence guidance) and a heart rate and rhythm monitor for 4 months or a smartphone-based health education app. Adherence was determined with 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC), and secondary outcomes of quality of life and health care utilization from interviews and health records.
Results
The trial randomized 270 individuals 1:1 (median [IQR] age 73.1 [67.5–78.6]; 163 [60.4 %] female sex). Over the 4-month intervention, intervention participants used the relational agent a median of 101 (IQR: 72, 110) days. In an intention-to-treat analysis there was no significant difference in 12-month PDC between the intervention and control groups (median [IQR]: intervention 0.97 [0.89–1.00] versus control 0.97 [0.92–1.00]) or in PDC ≥0.80. Intervention participants were more likely to self-report anticoagulation adherence than control at 4 and 8 months (95.7 % vs 88.4 % and 93.0 % vs 78.8 %, respectively) but not at 12 months. There were no significant differences by assigned intervention for the other secondary outcomes.
Conclusions
Randomization to the relational agent intervention was not associated with improved PDC at 12-months but with greater interim self-reported adherence compared to a control. This study demonstrates the successful use of a smartphone-based agent to address adherence among rural individuals with AF.}

abstract = {Background
Case studies have shown ChatGPT can run clinical simulations at the medical student level. However, no data have assessed ChatGPT’s reliability in meeting desired simulation criteria such as medical accuracy, simulation formatting, and robust feedback mechanisms.
Objective
This study aims to quantify ChatGPT’s ability to consistently follow formatting instructions and create simulations for preclinical medical student learners according to principles of medical simulation and multimedia educational technology.
Methods
Using ChatGPT-4 and a prevalidated starting prompt, the authors ran 360 separate simulations of an acute asthma exacerbation. A total of 180 simulations were given correct answers and 180 simulations were given incorrect answers. ChatGPT was evaluated for its ability to adhere to basic simulation parameters (stepwise progression, free response, interactivity), advanced simulation parameters (autonomous conclusion, delayed feedback, comprehensive feedback), and medical accuracy (vignette, treatment updates, feedback). Significance was determined with χ² analyses using 95% CIs for odds ratios.
Results
In total, 100% (n=360) of simulations met basic simulation parameters and were medically accurate. For advanced parameters, 55% (200/360) of all simulations delayed feedback, while the Correct arm (157/180, 87%) delayed feedback was significantly more than the Incorrect arm (43/180, 24%; P<.001). A total of 79% (285/360) of simulations concluded autonomously, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in autonomous conclusion (146/180, 81% and 139/180, 77%; P=.36). Overall, 78% (282/360) of simulations gave comprehensive feedback, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in comprehensive feedback (137/180, 76% and 145/180, 81%; P=.31). ChatGPT-4 was not significantly more likely to conclude simulations autonomously (P=.34) and provide comprehensive feedback (P=.27) when feedback was delayed compared to when feedback was not delayed.
Conclusions
These simulations have the potential to be a reliable educational tool for simple simulations and can be evaluated by a novel 9-part metric. Per this metric, ChatGPT simulations performed perfectly on medical accuracy and basic simulation parameters. It performed well on comprehensive feedback and autonomous conclusion. Delayed feedback depended on the accuracy of user inputs. A simulation meeting one advanced parameter was not more likely to meet all advanced parameters. Further work must be done to ensure consistent performance across a broader range of simulation scenarios.}

Recent research has suggested that combining CJ with various approaches to judge recruitment, including community-driven and crowdsourcing methods, holds promise as a method of assessing L2 writing, especially for research purposes. However, the majority of studies to date have tested CJ only using relatively simple, easily evaluated sets of texts. There remains insufficient evidence of the method’s potential for assessing more complex texts, particularly when the comparisons are being conducted by crowdsourced assessors. This study seeks to address this problem by testing the reliability and validity of a crowdsourced form of CJ for the assessment of texts which are longer, more topically diverse, and more homogeneous in proficiency than those used in earlier studies. The results suggest that CJ can be conducted with crowdsourced judges to generate reliable assessments of L2 writing, and provide initial evidence of concurrent validity.

abstract = {Modern network monitoring applications often rely on traditional machine learning models conceived for specific analysis tasks, which require extensive feature engineering, retraining for different use cases, and struggle with generalization. This lack of adaptability makes the deployment of AI/ML solutions in network monitoring a daunting task, as each new scenario requires significant reconfiguration, manual tuning, and retraining efforts, undermining the broader adoption of AI/ML for network traffic analysis. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), pre-trained on vast and diverse time-series datasets, offer a promising alternative in the network monitoring realm by enabling zero-shot and few-shot adaptability across different monitoring scenarios. In this work, we explore the potential of TSFMs for network monitoring by evaluating their performance in a challenging analysis task: estimating video streaming Quality of Experience (QoE) from encrypted network traffic. Our study assesses the zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of state-of-the-art TSFMs, the impact of time-series granularity, and the role of common traffic features in performance. Using real-world video streaming QoE datasets, we show that TSFMs achieve competitive results in a zero-shot setting — plug-and-play approach, and that their performance can be easily and cost-effectively improved through few-shot learning techniques, even when applied on NetFlow-like features with coarse granularity. Beyond the specific video streaming QoE monitoring application, our findings demonstrate the viability and broader applicability of TSFMs to network monitoring tasks, opening the door to more scalable and generalizable network management solutions.}

abstract = {Purpose
The increasing presence of traditional or new forms of robots at work demonstrates how the copresence of workers and robots might reframe work and workplaces and consequently arouse new human resource management (HRM) questions regarding how to manage the spatiotemporal change of work in organizations. Based on a spatiotemporal perspective, this conceptual article examines the implication of new spatiotemporal dynamics of work, which are generated by the interaction between workers and traditional or new forms of robots that are driven by advanced digital technologies, for HRM.
Design/methodology/approach
The article begins by carrying out a selective review focusing on the studies that enhanced the comprehension of the digital-driven spatiotemporal dynamics of work. It then presents a spatiotemporal framework from which it examines the implications of digital-driven spatiotemporal work boundaries for HRM. The article ends by underscoring the theoretical and empirical importance of taking more interest in new spatiotemporal forms of work for developing the HRM of the future.
Findings
By developing the notion of workuniverses, which denotes the spatiotemporal boundaries generated by the act of working through the interaction between workers and different forms of robots, this research first develops a theoretical framework that discerns three forms of spatiotemporal dynamics forming workuniverses at different levels and two spatiotemporal arrays for managing the spatiotemporal change of work in organizations. The HRM questions and ethical concerns generated by the formation of workuniverses are then revealed through four focuses: the management ethics in workuniverses, individuals' spatiotemporal well-being, collective spatiotemporal coordination and spatiotemporal change management in workuniverses.
Originality/value
This research provides an original perspective, which is the spatiotemporal perspective, to examine the new spatiotemporal dynamics that form workuniverses and the HRM questions and concerns generated by the increasing interaction between workers and different forms of digital-driven robots.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to explore the distribution and difference of orofacial two-point discrimination threshold (2-PDT) between patients with pain-related Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) and healthy individuals.
Methods
This study included 58 pain-related TMDs patients and 58 healthy individuals. Demographics including the gender, age of participants were collected. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ), mandible, zygomatic and temporal 2-PDTs were examined for statistical analyses.
Results
Pain-related TMDs patients showed significantly higher 2-PDTs in all tested regions (p < 0.001). In gender subgroups of the control, males had significantly higher 2-PDTs than females in bilateral TMJ and temporal regions. In gender subgroups of patients, no statistical 2-PDT differences were found between males and females. Pain-related TMDs females had higher 2-PDTs than control females in all regions, which were also observed between pain-related TMDs males and control males (p < 0.001), except for temporal 2-PDTs. Only pain-related TMDs were significantly associated with orofacial 2-PDTs with β coefficients varied from 3.5 to 7 (p < 0.001). The discrimination performance of 2-PDTs on pain-related TMDs was considered effective, while the TMJ 2-PDTs was the best single predictor (Area under curve: 0.833).
Conclusion
Pain-related TMDs patients had weaker orofacial tactile acuity, which was consistent in gender subgroups, except for the temporal region of males. Healthy males had weaker tactile acuity compared to females in TMJ and temporal regions. No significant gender effect on orofacial tactile acuity was observed among male and female patients. The 2-PDTs of the tested sites, especially for TMJ, has the potential for further utilization in pain-related TMDs patients.}

While the effects of sugars on metabolic diseases are well-known, the role of iron remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of a high-fat high-iron animal diet on body metabolism in mice. Micro-PET imaging was used to assess 18-F-labelled glucose uptake in BAT, and the morphology, respiratory function, and oxidative stress of BAT mitochondria were examined. The underlying mechanisms were elucidated by analyzing the expression of UCP-1, PGC-1α and PPARα. The high-iron high-fat diet increased appetite, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced insulin sensitivity. Additionally, the high-iron diet promoted gluconeogenesis only in the absence of high-fat levels. Both high-iron and high-fat diets suppressed BAT activity, increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, decreased mitochondrial respiratory function, and lowered thermogenic gene expression. Weight loss strategies focusing solely on reducing carbohydrates and increasing animal foods, like ketogenic diets, may have long-term detrimental effects on metabolic health. Prioritizing dietary diversity and monitoring overall caloric intake is advisable for optimal outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Psychosocial intervention studies aimed at reducing stress among parents of children with cancer have historically included insufficient samples of African American parents. Pediatric oncology nurses are uniquely positioned to identify and address parent psychosocial needs. However, research exploring their perspectives to serve as psychosocial interventionists specifically for African American families of children with cancer is limited.
Objective
To explore the perspectives of pediatric oncology nurses on their role as psychosocial interventionists for African American families navigating childhood cancer.
Methods
We conducted 32 remote individual interviews and 2 focus groups (n = 4 each) with 40 pediatric oncology nurses from three pediatric cancer centers and a large pediatric oncology nursing organization. Using Corbin and Strauss’ Grounded Theory methodology, we used constant comparative analysis to generate a theory based on the nurses’ perspectives.
Results
Our emergent theory—Structurally Differential Care—had two major themes (psychosocial resource facilitators and psychosocial resource obstructors). Psychosocial resource facilitators: 1) appreciating families’ experiences, 2) longitudinal presence, 3) open communication, 4) holistic care, and 5) safe spaces mitigated structurally differential care. Nurses also identified: 1) difficulty with serious illness conversation, 2) lack of nursing experience, and 3) competing work demands as psychosocial resource obstructors that intensify structurally differential care.
Conclusion
This sample of pediatric oncology nurses described experiences that either bolstered or obstructed their psychosocial care provision, signaling potential opportunities for nurse-targeted interventions that may reduce factors contributing to disparities in the psychosocial care for African American families of children with cancer.}

Based on this analysis, the article argues that humans and AI need to work together to minimize errors, reduce risks, maximize performance, and enhance the attainment of organizational goals. Rather than viewing AI as a tool to reduce headcount, organizations should see it as an opportunity to enhance human work and maximize value for the organization by restructuring roles, workflows, and learning systems around the unique strengths of human employees and AI.

Structural representations of bias using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a unified approach to conceptualize bias, distinguish between different types of bias, and identify ways to address bias. DAG-based data simulation further enhances the scope of this approach. Recently, DAGs have been used to demonstrate how missing eligibility information can compromise emulated target trial analysis, a cutting edge approach to estimate treatment effects using real-world data. The importance of simulation for methodological research has received substantial recognition in the past few years, and others have argued that simulating data based on DAGs can be especially helpful for understanding various epidemiological concepts. In the present work, we present two concrete examples of how simulations based on DAGs can be used to gain insights into issues commonly encountered in real-world analytics, i.e., regression modelling to address confounding bias, and the potential extent of selection bias. Increasing accessibility and extending the simulation algorithms of existing software to include longitudinal and time-to-event data are identified as priorities for further development. With such extensions, simulations based on DAGs would be an even more powerful tool to advance our understanding of the rapidly growing toolbox of real-world analytics.}

This study investigates how brand-imposed language constraints affect engagement in sponsored influencer content. Drawing on Media Naturalness Theory and the control paradox, we hypothesize that language formality disrupts the authenticity of influencer communication, leading to lower engagement. Using a dataset of 1.4 million Instagram posts, including around 200,000 sponsored postings, our analysis reveals that formal language reduces engagement, while informal language features, specifically higher use of netspeak and emojis, enhance engagement. To further validate these findings, we conducted a controlled experiment examining the effect of language style on engagement and perceived authenticity. These findings suggest that informal language fosters a more genuine connection between influencers and their audiences, increasing interaction in sponsored content. The paper provides practical recommendations for brands, urging them to co-create flexible language strategies with influencers, allowing for more authentic expression and boosting consumer engagement. The current study also uses the latest agentic AI models to replicate similar results through additional experiments, contributing to the theoretical understanding of influencer marketing and the practical strategies for optimizing influencer collaborations.}

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has increased faster in low- and middle-income countries. We determined how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the relationship between income level and prevalence of DM, disease management, and the use of primary care services.
Methods
Descriptive cross-sectional study. It included diabetic patients over 14 years of age residing in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria as of 31 December 2022. The results were compared with those of a pre-pandemic study in 2019.
Results
The prevalence of DM in 2022 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was almost identical to that of 2019, with a slight decrease in the low- and high-income groups, and an increase in the middle-income group. The average age of the population with DM increased. The average number of visits to the doctor increased, while visits to the nursing home decreased. A worsening of glycosylated hemoglobin and low-density lipoproteins was found in high and middle incomes. The trend was the opposite for body weight, with a 1.2% increase in the prevalence of overweight/obesity in low incomes.
Conclusions
Lower incomes were associated with worse outcomes in terms of overweight and obesity. The situation of people with DM with overweight or obesity worsened compared to 2019 for the lower-income population.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La prevalencia de diabetes mellitus (DM) ha aumentado más rápido en los países de ingresos bajos y medios. Se determinó cómo la pandemia de COVID-19 pudo haber afectado a la relación entre nivel de ingresos y prevalencia de DM, el abordaje de la enfermedad y el uso de los servicios de atención primaria.
Métodos
Estudio descriptivo transversal. Incluyó a pacientes diabéticos mayores de 14 años residentes en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria a 31 de diciembre de 2022. Los resultados se compararon con los de un estudio previo a la pandemia de 2019.
Resultados
La prevalencia de DM en 2022 en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria fue casi idéntica a la de 2019, con un ligero descenso en los grupos de rentas bajas y altas, y un aumento en el grupo de rentas medias. La edad media de la población con DM aumentó. El número medio de visitas al médico aumentó, mientras que las visitas a enfermería disminuyeron. Se encontró un empeoramiento de la glucohemoglobina y las lipoproteínas de baja densidad en los ingresos altos y medios. La tendencia fue la opuesta para el peso corporal, con un aumento del 1,2% en la prevalencia de sobrepeso/obesidad en los ingresos bajos.
Conclusiones
Los ingresos más bajos se asociaron a peores resultados en materia de sobrepeso y obesidad. La situación de las personas con DM con sobrepeso u obesidad empeoró en comparación con 2019 para la población de menores ingresos.}

Oxidative stress (OS) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemia. In this study, the effect of melatonin and N-acetylcysteine on ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative stress injury in the cerebral cortex of male rats was investigated. 30 male Wistar rats were divided into sham, ischemic, NAC, melatonin and NAC + melatonin groups. All groups, except the sham group, underwent MCAO on the left side, and the treatment groups received intraperitoneal injections of either 50 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 5 mg/kg melatonin or a combination of both 24 and 48 hours later. At 24 and 72 hours after surgery, the animals were examined for sensory and motor activity. The cerebral cortex was dissected after sacrificing the rats, infarct volume estimated and the concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicate that the NAC + melatonin group exhibited elevated sensory-motor activity and a reduced infarct volume rate in comparison to the ischemic group (p≤ 0.05). Compared to the ischemic group, the NAC + melatonin group showed a significant increase in SOD concentration and a significant decrease in MDA (p≤ 0.05). It can therefore be concluded that the simultaneous administration of NAC and melatonin can reduce the cerebral infarction volume, and improve neurological functions by modulating SOD and MDA.}

Cost-effectiveness analyse (CEA) generate extensive data that can support much health economic research. However, manual data collection is time-consuming and prone to errors. Development in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) offers a solution for automating this process. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLM-based data extraction and assess its feasibility for supporting CEA data collection.
Methods
We evaluated the performance of the custom ChatGPT model (GPT), the Tufts CEA Registry (TCRD), and the researcher-validated data (RVE) in extracting 36 predetermined variables from 34 selected structured articles. Concordance rates between GPT and RVE, TCRD and RVE, and GPT and TCRD were calculated and compared. Paired student’s t tests assessed differences in accuracy, and concordance rates across 36 variables were provided.
Results
The accuracy of GPT (GPT & RVE) was comparable to the accuracy of TCRD (TCRD & RVE) (mean 0.88, SD 0.06 vs mean 0.90, SD 0.06, P = .71). The performance of GPT varied across variables. GPT outperformed TCRD in capturing “Population and Intervention Details” but struggled with complex variables like “Utility.”

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objectives
Timely access to current rheumatology guidelines at the point of care is challenging. We aimed to develop and evaluate the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed for adult rheumatology, integrating European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines to provide rheumatologists with timely evidence-based recommendations.
Methods
EULAR and ACR management guidelines were selected by rheumatologists based on their clinical relevance for decision-making and processed. A RAG system was implemented. To evaluate it, 10 questions per guideline were generated using ChatGPT 4.5. Answers to these were produced by ChatGPT-o3-mini with context retrieval (RAG) and without (baseline). Performance was assessed by an Large language model (LLM)-as-a-judge (Gemini 2.0 Flash) using a 5-point Likert scale across 5 dimensions: relevance, factual accuracy, safety, completeness, and conciseness; it also determined preference between the RAG and baseline responses. For validation, 2 rheumatologists independently evaluated a random sample of questions (15%) on the same domains. Statistical significance was established using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and binomial tests.
Results
Seventy-four guidelines were included, yielding 740 evaluation questions. The LLM-as-a-judge evaluation showed the RAG system significantly outperformed the baseline across all criteria (P < .001). Manual evaluation confirmed these findings (P < .001) for accuracy, safety, and completeness. The RAG system was significantly preferred by the LLM-as-a-judge in 92.8% of comparisons and by the human evaluators in 71.2% to 74.8% (P < .001).
Conclusions
Developing a RAG system integrating extensive EULAR/ACR rheumatology guidelines improves answer quality compared to a baseline LLM. This evaluation provides a robust foundation for reliable, artificial intelligence-driven clinical decision support tools designed to enhance evidence-based practice by providing clinicians with rapid, context-aware access to recommendations.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore how changes in planned retirement age, practice setting, and physician productivity may impact the workforce shortage in urology.
Methods
We compared data between the 2015 and 2022 American Urological Association census, a specialty-wide annual survey which collects data on demographics, practice patterns, and procedures from a representative sample of U.S. urologists. Workforce productivity was measured by the self-reported number of hours worked per week and patients seen per week. A novel formula was developed to demonstrate how planned retirement age and productivity impact the workforce’s production capacity.
Results
The total number of practicing urologists increased during the period from 2015 to 2022 (11,990 to 13,976), while the mean age of practicing urologists decreased slightly (55.0 to 54.5years; P < .002). During this period, the mean planned age of retirement for all urologists decreased from 68.9years to 67.7 (P < .001). Urologists in solo practice had a significantly higher planned age of retirement at 71.9years (P < .001) as compared to all other practice models. The number of patients seen per week for all urologists decreased from 78.7 to 72.9 (P < .001). The amount of hours worked per week remained relatively constant between the study periods. The maximum possible number of patients seen by the workforce prior to retirement increased by only 2.4% during the study interval.
Conclusion
Though the U.S. urology workforce is growing and the mean age is decreasing, decreases in planned retirement age and productivity may offset these gains and intensify the physician shortage for U.S. urologists.}

abstract = {Background
Most birthing people in the United States initiate lactation, but little is known about lactation practices in patients who are critically ill.
Research Question
What are the lactation rates and practices in adult patients in the ICU and what are potential barriers to lactation and resource use?
Study Design and Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of immediately postpartum patients in the ICU at an academic medical center between January 2018 and January 2024. Information regarding initiation, cessation, communication, and lactation consultant (LC) services were extracted and bivariate tests of association were conducted.
Results
Most immediately postpartum patients in the ICU initiated lactation (85% [87 of 102]), but only 70% (72 of 102) continued until hospital discharge. Documented lactation plans were present before delivery for 60% of patients, and a documented plan to initiate lactation before delivery was associated with increased odds of initiating lactation after delivery (OR, 9.21; 95% CI, 1.96-43.3; P = .005). Although most patients (75%) saw LCs, less than 30% of patients saw LCs within 24 hours of delivery. An association between seeing an LC and continuing lactation until hospital discharge was found (OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 1.77-12.7; P = .002). More than one-half of lactating patients received mechanical ventilation (55%), but nearly 20% of these intubated patients did not undergo milk expression while ventilated.
Interpretation
Most postpartum patients who are critically ill initiate lactation, but not all continue until hospital discharge. Having documented plans to lactate before delivery and seeing LCs were protective of lactation in the ICU, but many patients did not see LCs promptly. Additional gaps in care included lack of documentation and delays in lactation initiation in intubated patients. We hypothesize that these gaps may hinder patients who are critically ill from achieving their personal lactation goals, and steps should be taken to address and mitigate these challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Sex workers face an epidemic of violence around the world. However, violence against sex workers (VASW) is underreported, and sex workers hesitate to report to the police because they are frequently punished; therefore, an alternative for reporting is needed. Sex workers also face stigmatization from health care workers, further discouraging help-seeking behavior or reporting in health care facilities. Sex workers have been recipients of services from nongovernmental organizations, typically related to HIV and sexual transmission of infections, but violence remains underaddressed.
Objective
This study aims to apply human-centered design methods to adapt ReportVASW for use in the Middle East and North Africa and to evaluate the usability of the prototype interface and identify opportunities for improvement.
Methods
Evaluation methods included cognitive walkthrough and System Usability Scale by 9 potential end users, and heuristic evaluation by 2 informatics professionals and 2 service providers.
Results
This study explores ways to improve the trilingual prototype of ReportVASW, with particular attention to ways to improve the data collection tool. Multiple methods identified multiple issues to address. Heuristic analysis revealed 2 serious issues to address, with scores over 2.5 out of 4 in the tool used. The most serious problems identified in heuristic analysis were related to language, particularly the Arabic version. Translation issues were addressed before end user testing. End users were enthusiastic about the idea of a mobile tool to document VASW, provided it led to change. They gave ReportVASW a System Usability Scale of 91.4, above the 68 considered good. Even as end users were enthusiastic, they offered suggestions for improvement.
Conclusions
Many opportunities to improve the interface were identified. Most changes are not overly complex, and the majority involve adapting the language used and improving the translation. Development of the trilingual ReportVASW data collection tool for the Middle East and North Africa region is worth pursuing.}

abstract = {Background
Limited evidence is available comparing the modified transtibial (MTT) and transportal (TP) techniques in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and their impact on returning to sports participation. The objective was to analyze the outcomes after arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL in recreational athletes with a 2-year postoperative follow-up, comparing the MTT and TP techniques, based on the method used to drill the femoral tunnel.
Hypotesis
The rate of return to sport would be comparable regardless of the surgical technique used.
Material and methods
A retrospective study was conducted with 66 patients who underwent arthroscopic monofascicular ACL reconstruction between September 2016 and March 2020. Patients aged between 16 and 50 years old, recreational athletes at Tegner levels 6 and 7, with a 2-year follow-up were included. Groups were established for comparative analysis (MTT vs TP) based on the method for drilling the femoral tunnel. The main outcome variable was the return to sport at the same level. Secondary variables included patient satisfaction evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and knee function according to the Lysholm scale.
Results
At 2 years of postoperative follow-up, the return to sport rate was 30.3 % in the MTT group and 33.3 % in the TP group (p = 0.791). There were no significant differences between both groups in patient satisfaction (p = 0.664) and knee function (p = 0.113).
Conclusion
Drilling the femoral tunnel with the MTT and TP techniques did not influence the rate of return to sport, patient satisfaction, and knee function in recreational athletes with 2 years of postoperative follow-up.

abstract = {Background
The effective implementation of personalized pharmacogenomics (PGx) requires the integration of released clinical guidelines into decision support systems to facilitate clinical applications. Large language models (LLMs) can be valuable tools for automating information extraction and updates.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of repeated cross-comparisons and an agreement-threshold strategy in 2 advanced LLMs as supportive tools for updating information.
Methods
The study evaluated the performance of 2 LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, in extracting PGx clinical guidelines and comparing their outputs with expert-annotated evaluations. The 2 LLMs classified 385 PGx clinical guidelines, with each recommendation tested 20 times per model. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with manually labeled data. Two prospectively defined strategies were used to identify inconsistent predictions. The first involved repeated cross-comparison, flagging discrepancies between the most frequent classifications from each model. The second used a consistency threshold strategy, which designated predictions appearing in less than 60% of the 40 combined outputs as unstable. Cases flagged by either strategy were subjected to manual review. This study also estimated the overall cost of model use and was conducted between October 1 and November 30, 2024.
Results
GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro yielded reproducibility rates of 97.8% (7534/7700) and 98.9% (7612/7700), respectively, based on the most frequent classification for each query. Compared with expert labels, GPT-4o achieved 93.5% accuracy (Cohen κ=0.90; P<.001) and Gemini-1.5-Pro 92.7% accuracy (Cohen κ=0.89; P<.001). Both models demonstrated high overall performance, with comparable weighted average F1-scores (GPT-4o: 0.929; Gemini: 0.935). The models generated consistent predictions for 341 of 385 guideline items, reducing the need for manual review by 88.6%. Among these agreed-upon cases, only one (0.3%) diverged from expert labels. Applying a predefined agreement-threshold strategy further reduced the number of priority manual review cases to 2.9% (11/385), although the error rate slightly increased to 0.5% (2/374). The inconsistencies identified through these methods prompted the prioritization of manual review to minimize errors and enhance clinical applicability. The total combined cost of using both LLMs was only US $0.76.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that using 2 LLMs can effectively streamline PGx guideline integration into clinical decision support systems while maintaining high performance and minimal cost. Although selective manual review remains necessary, this approach offers a practical and scalable solution for PGx guideline classification in clinical workflows.}

Two pathologists independently evaluated the microscopic descriptions and diagnoses using a predefined scoring system (0–4 for microscopic descriptions and 0–2 for pathological diagnoses), with higher scores indicating greater accuracy. Microscopic descriptions that received perfect scores, which included all relevant keywords and findings, were then presented to the standard version of ChatGPT to assess its diagnostic capabilities based on these descriptions. GPT-4 showed consistency in microscopic description and diagnosis scores across five rounds, accomplishing median scores of 50 % and 48.6 %, respectively. However, its performance was still inferior to junior and senior pathology residents (73.9 % and 93.9 % description scores and 63.9 % and 87.9 % diagnosis scores, respectively). When analyzing classic ChatGPT's understanding of microscopic descriptions provided by residents, it correctly diagnosed 35 (87.5 %) of cases from junior residents and 44 (68.8 %) from senior residents, given that the initial descriptions consisted of keywords and relevant findings. While GPT-4 can accurately interpret some histopathological images, its overall performance is currently inferior to that of pathology residents. However, ChatGPT's ability to accurately interpret and diagnose diseases from the descriptions provided by residents suggests that this technology could serve as a valuable support tool in pathology diagnostics.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded as one of the key technological innovations of the 21st century. Within healthcare, much attention has been placed upon the ability of deductive AI systems to analyse large datasets to find patterns that would be unfeasible to program. Generative AI, including generative adversarial networks, are a newer type of machine learning that functions to create fake data after learning the properties of real data. Artificially generated patient data has the potential to revolutionise clinical research and protect patient privacy. Using novel techniques, it is increasingly possible to fully anonymise datasets to the point where no datapoint is traceable to any real individual. This can be used to expand and balance datasets as well as to replace the use of real patient data in certain contexts. This paper focuses upon three key uses of synthetic data: clinical research, data privacy and medical education. We also highlight ethical and practical concerns that require consideration.}

Data from various sensors, such as cameras and thermal detectors, have become very common, but the incorporation of audio data remains largely unexplored. Audio is crucial in process monitoring and root cause analysis, providing early warnings of potential problems such as tool wear or spindle failures. Generating audio signals for different process states could revolutionize how factories predict failures and manage machinery, shifting from reactive to proactive monitoring. This paper proposes the first step in a new method to create audio and seamlessly integrate it into Virtual factories, enabling real-time sound generation that mirrors the sounds produced by different machinery and processes. For this paper, a dataset is created using the audio of a table CNC machine. The data set is formed using a simple Design of Experiments (DOE) with two process conditions and three levels. The model discussed in the paper is a convolutional auto-encoder that leverages the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of audio as input to generate audio. The model was trained for 6 h and can recreate audio that looks very close to the real audio with a mean square error of about 0.2027. Integrating audio with virtual reality (VR) will enhance the immersive experience of virtual factories, making training and process simulations more immersive. By generating real-time machine sounds, virtual reality environments will allow operators to practice identifying mechanical problems based on auditory cues, thus improving situational awareness and decision-making. This multi-sensory approach will bring better learning outcomes, reduce errors, and enhance safety in industrial training, which will enable users to anticipate and respond to potential machinery problems more effectively.}

abstract = {Introduction
Septic surgical patients undergoing emergency general surgery represent a distinct population with unique challenges. This study aimed to identify predictors of cumulative 90-d mortality, including clinical and socioeconomic factors, and to analyze causes of death in this cohort.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit from 2011 to 2019 with sepsis (sequential organ failure assessment score ≥2) undergoing emergency intra-abdominal surgery (n = 498). Demographics, comorbidities, sepsis presentation, and socioeconomic metrics, including the area deprivation index (ADI), were analyzed. Independent predictors of mortality were identified using multiple logistic regression. The causes of death were categorized and analyzed.
Results
Among 498 patients, 46% (n = 229) died within 90 d. Nonsurvivors were older (65 ± 13.7 versus 61.2 ± 13.5 y, P < 0.01), more often transferred from external facilities (59% versus 46%, P < 0.01), and had higher rates of liver disease, chronic kidney disease, metastatic cancer, obesity, and higher Charlson comorbidity index scores (P < 0.01 for all). Independent predictors of 90-d mortality included admission sequential organ failure assessment scores, serum lactate, obesity, ADI, Charlson comorbidity index, and transfer status. ADI remained a significant predictor, while the distressed communities index did not. Of the deaths, 76.9% were in-hospital deaths, with intra-abdominal catastrophes (35.4%), multisystem organ failure (25.2%), and pulmonary causes (16.4%) as the most common causes.
Conclusions
Intra-abdominal catastrophes, multiorgan failure, and pulmonary complications are leading causes of death in septic emergency general surgery patients. ADI is a robust socioeconomic predictor of mortality, underscoring the need for integrating social determinants into risk assessment and tailored care strategies. Developing comprehensive risk models may enhance prognostication and guide clinical decision-making in this critical population.}

We contacted 60 male patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged 8–18 years through the Swiss Registry for Neuromuscular Disorders. Mobility, school problems and social participation in leisure activities were assessed with a self-constructed questionnaire. Quality of life and executive function were assessed using KIDSCREEN-10 and BRIEF scores, respectively. Out of 60 dispatched surveys, 67 % were filled out and included. Approximately half of the participants went to a special needs school, and 83 % rated their overall quality of life as good.

The framework accomplishes this task using four phases including data collection, tokenization, query construction, and response generation. The data collection phase involves gathering domain-specific user reviews from public and private repositories. In the tokenization phase, ChatReview applies sentiment analysis to extract keywords and categorize them into various sentiment classes. This process creates a token repository that best describes the user sentiments for a given user-review data. In the query construction phase, the framework uses the token repository and domain knowledge to construct three types of ChatGPT prompts including explicit, implicit, and creative. In the response generation phase, ChatReview pipelines these prompts into ChatGPT to generate search results at varying levels of granularity. We analyze our framework using three real-world domains including education, local restaurants, and hospitality. We assert that our framework simplifies prompt engineering for general users to produce effective results while minimizing the exposure of sensitive user data to search engines. We also present a one-of-a-kind Large Language Model (LLM) peer assessment of the ChatReview framework. Specifically, we employ Google’s Bard to objectively and qualitatively analyze the various ChatReview outputs. Our Bard-based analyses yield over 90% satisfaction, establishing ChatReview as a viable survey analysis tool.}

abstract = {Background:
Regulatory authorities issued precautionary recommendations on the use of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) following the ORAL Surveillance trial [1], which demonstrated an elevated risk of cancer with tofacitinib, compared to TNF inhibitors (TNFi). While these findings have influenced clinical guidance, there is still limited real-world evidence on malignancy risks associated with JAKi treatment.
Objectives:
To assess the incidence of cancer in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with JAKi, compared to other biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), using data from a large, multi-country, real-world population.
Methods:
We studied patients from 13 RA registers across Europe and Québec, starting JAKi, TNFi -inhibitors (TNFi) or bDMARDs with other modes of action (OMA). Outcomes of interest were categorized into cancer excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC); and NMSC cases. Cancers were linked to treatments within 5 years of cessation or until follow-up loss, death, or study end, whichever came first. Incidence rates (IR) per 100 patient-years (PY) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. Poisson regression, with propensity score weighting (including country, disease-, and patient-characteristics, and comorbidities, see Figure 1), was used to obtain adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR), with 95% CI. A sub-analysis was performed on patients aged ≥ 50 years and ≥ 1 cardiovascular risk factor, mimicking the “ORAL Surveillance” trial inclusion criteria (high risk cohort).
Results:
Over the 53'169 treatment initiations considered in 33'127 patients, 638 cancers excluding NMSC and 219 NMSC were reported. Crude incidence of cancer excluding NMSC was lower for TNFi (2.2/1000 PY) than for JAKi (2.9/1000 PY) and OMA (3.1/1000 PY). The adjusted Poisson regression found no significant difference in the incidence of cancer excluding NMSC (aIRR = 1.10; 95% CI [0.89; 1.37]) or NMSC (aIRR = 1.12; 95% CI [0.78; 1.60]) between JAKi and TNFi, nor between JAKi and OMA (aIRR = 1.07; 95% CI [0.86; 1.32] and aIRR = 0.79; 95% CI [0.54; 1.15] respectively). The high risk cohort accounted for 39.4% of treatment courses and had a higher incidence of cancer in each treatment group (OMA: 4.1/1000 PY, JAKi: 4.2/1000 PY, TNFi: 3.2/1000 PY). Similarly to the overall population, no significant difference in the incidence of cancer excluding NMSC (aIRR = 1.16; 95% CI [0.86; 1.57]) and NMSC (aIRR = 1.15; 95% CI [0.71; 1.84]) was observed between JAKi and TNFi, nor between JAKi and OMA (aIRR = 1.09; 95% CI [0.81; 1.47] and aIRR = 0.92; 95% CI [0.58; 1.46] respectively).
Conclusion:
In this real-world study, including 13 RA registers and all currently available JAKi, we did not find a significantly higher risk of cancer excluding NMSC or of NMSC in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to bDMARDs (TNFi or OMA). Further analyses are planned, including the inclusion of additional registries to enhance statistical power and the evaluation of incidence across different exposure periods.

abstract = {Language learning is increasingly being extended into digital and online spaces that have been enhanced by simulated reality and augmented with data and artificial intelligence. While this may expand opportunities for language learning, some critics argue that digital spaces may represent a pastiche or a parody of reality. However, while there are genuine issues, such criticisms may often fall back on naïve or essentialist views of authenticity, in particular by narrowing language learning scenarios to real-life or genuine communication. I argue that research undersocialises authenticity by not taking social relations into sufficient consideration, which denies or elides the ways that authenticity is achieved. In this conceptual paper, I offer a relational account of authenticity, where I conceive digital environments within a stratified ontological framework, where authenticity is not inherent in individuals or texts, but instead emerges from complex social contexts. Authenticity, then, does not refer to authenticity of texts or “being oneself”, but authenticity in relation to others. A stratified ontology provides opportunities to extend relations with others, offering what is described as a “submersion into a temporary agency”, where language learners can experiment with the social order in order to achieve authenticity of themselves in the target language. Finally, I present a relational pedagogy based on responsiveness, where feedback is distributed among disparate human and technical actors which facilitate, problematise or endorse authenticity.}

abstract = {Background
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a crucial outcome for cancer patients, providing a comprehensive measure of patient well-being beyond traditional clinical endpoints. While HRQoL data are increasingly available from real-world data (RWD), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies, they remain fragmented, limiting their utility for large-scale analysis. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group’s BALANCE project aims to address this by pooling and harmonizing international HRQoL datasets for breast cancer patients.
Materials and methods
This article describes the challenges of pooling international HRQoL datasets, including the process of dataset identification, acquisition, and harmonization within the BALANCE project.
Results
We successfully pooled and harmonized six datasets, representing 6500 patients and over 30 000 observations from diverse RCTs, observational studies, and RWD sources. The resulting database includes 142 variables across demographic, clinical, and HRQoL domains. Challenges included various interpretations of the General Data Protection Regulation across Europe, related to data protection and ownership. Furthermore, inconsistent data collection and resource limitations (e.g. funding or personnel) required iterative negotiations and customized harmonization. This led to the exclusion of 17 datasets containing an estimated number of 20 000-22 500 patients.
Conclusions
The BALANCE project demonstrates the feasibility of pooling international HRQoL data by overcoming key barriers and creating one of the largest HRQoL datasets for breast cancer. It lays the groundwork for upcoming publications focused on developing and validating prediction models. Future research should focus on adopting standardized data models, including secondary use clauses in consent forms, and establishing RWD registries to facilitate data sharing.}
