abstract = {Introduction
The rising prevalence of obesity is of particular concern due to its association with a range of serious complications, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer. Obesity medications can control the disease but it is unclear how patients choose which medication to use.
Methods
A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to investigate how patients select between obesity medications. Fifteen treatment naive adults with a body mass index ≥27 kg/m2 with at least one weight-related complications were recruited.
Results
The 5 major themes depicting how patients make selections included 1) Effectiveness of medication, 2) Information to make decisions, 3) Safety of medications, 4) Practicality and 5) Individual Strategies and Community Supports in Obesity Management. Safety concerns of side effects and long-term risks were perceived major barriers to initiating or adhering to pharmacotherapy.
Conclusion
In a situation where the medications are described as being free and readily available, patient preferences for obesity medications are shaped by treatment efficacy, safety, information provided by healthcare providers. To enhance adherence and improve patient outcomes, healthcare providers should focus on delivering clear, comprehensive information and fostering strong support systems for patients.}

abstract = {Introduction
Bloodletting therapy (BLT), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) non-pharmaceutical therapy, may have a good antipyretic effect, but the evidence has not been evaluated. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the antipyretic effect and safety of TCM BLT used in patients with infections.
Methods
The protocol of this review was registered in PROSPERO (No.CRD42023411059). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BLT alone or in combination with another therapy to controls (no treatment or usual care). A search of CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Sinomed, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases was conducted up to March 2023. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and GRADE were used for assessing methodological quality of included trials and certainty of evidence.
Result
Fourteen RCTs (1419 participants) were included. BLT (either used alone or as add on therapy) was superior to drugs alone in increasing antipyretic rate and lowering the body temperature only for adults. For children or when combined with pediatric Tuina or herbal medicine, its advantages were not shown. The fever clearance time may be shortened (Mean Difference (MD)=-7.59 h, 95 %CI -12.73 h to -2.44 h, 194 participants, I2=69 %, 3 trials, P = 0.004) and the commencement of fever abatement (MD=-1.48 h, 95 %CI -2.02 h to -0.94 h, 134 participants, I2=0 %, 2 trials, P < 0.00001) improved when used as an adjunctive treatment with pediatric Tuina. Safety of BLT to treat fever was still unclear since few trials reported this relevant outcome. Certainty of evidence was very low.
Conclusion
The long-term (24hrs+) antipyretic effect of BLT alone and combined with drugs may be better than that of drugs alone for adults. For children combining BLT and pediatric Tuina/herbal medicine was no better in increasing antipyretic rate compared to pediatric Tuina/herbal medicine alone. Current evidence does not provide firm conclusions about the safety of BLT.}

abstract = {As global energy demand rises and environmental problems worsen, energy optimization in intelligent buildings has become a key research focus. This paper combines generative AI technology with 3D modeling to propose a spatial design method for energy optimization of intelligent buildings. This method employs generative AI to enhance the spatial layout of the building and iteratively optimizes energy consumption in the design scheme through several rounds of refinement. Experiments show that the design scheme using this method can significantly reduce building energy consumption. The energy consumption of the intelligent optimization design solution is 600 kWh lower than that of the traditional design solution across several types of buildings, including office buildings, residential areas, and public spaces. This reduction was observed under varying environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, highlighting the adaptability and effectiveness of the intelligent optimization design solution. In addition, a comparative analysis of multiple building configurations and external environmental factors, such as varying spatial layouts, solar panel usage, and insulation materials, further validates the applicability of this intelligent design approach in different building types and operational settings. In addition, with the increase of spatial layout optimization, building energy efficiency has been improved, and the energy efficiency improvement ratio in some areas is close to 20 %. Solar photovoltaic panels offer the most significant energy efficiency improvement, increasing efficiency by 30 % with a long service life. Other renewable energy sources, such as geothermal and bioenergy, also enhance efficiency. Geothermal energy, for instance, improves efficiency by 20 % to 45 %, depending on location and system integration, and is particularly effective in climates with seasonal temperature variations, reducing heating and cooling energy demand. The optimization solution combining generative AI and 3D modeling not only improves the energy efficiency of buildings, but also provides a sustainable and low-carbon building design path. Through intelligent optimization, buildings can achieve lower energy consumption and higher energy utilization efficiency during use, providing strong technical support for the realization of green buildings.}

abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping technological pathways in the global energy transition. While AI holds great potential to enhance the efficiency, resilience, and integration of renewable energy systems, its effective deployment depends heavily on supportive financial structures. Moreover, empirical assessments of AI’s macroeconomic impact are limited by the absence of standardized, internationally comparable measures of AI development. To address this problem, we construct a multidimensional AI composite index using the projection pursuit method, integrating eleven indicators across scientific innovation, infrastructure support, and global competitiveness. The index spans 119 countries from 2010 to 2022, offering improved spatial-temporal coverage for global analysis. Using this dataset, we empirically investigate the effect of AI on renewable energy transition and explore the mediating and threshold roles of financial development. We apply a suite of econometric models, including fixed-effect regression, mediation effect regression, dynamic threshold effect regression, and robustness check using industrial robot proxies and GMM. Results show that AI development significantly promotes the energy transition toward renewables. This finding holds true in both low-income and high-income countries. However, the role of financial development is twofold: it mediates AI’s impact, but in its current fossil fuel–biased form, may also exert a suppressive effect on green transformation. Notably, once financial development surpasses a critical threshold, the influence of AI on energy transition is amplified. Our findings offer new insights into the interaction between digital innovation and sustainable finance, and provide timely evidence for designing financial and technological policies that support AI-driven renewable energy transition.}

abstract = {Tiny machine learning (TinyML) promises to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and industrial maintenance by running machine learning models on low-power embedded systems. However, the complex optimizations required for successful TinyML deployment continue to impede its widespread adoption. A promising route to simplifying TinyML is through automatic machine learning (AutoML), which can distill elaborate optimization workflows into accessible key decisions. Notably, Hardware Aware Neural Architecture Searches — where a computer searches for an optimal TinyML model based on predictive performance and hardware metrics — have gained significant traction, producing some of today’s most widely used TinyML models. TinyML systems operate under extremely tight resource constraints, such as a few kB of memory and an energy consumption in the mW range. In this tight design space, the choice of input data configuration offers an attractive accuracy-latency tradeoff. Achieving truly optimal TinyML systems thus requires jointly tuning both input data and model architecture. Despite its importance, this “Data Aware Neural Architecture Search” remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a new state-of-the-art Data Aware Neural Architecture Search technique and demonstrate its effectiveness on the novel TinyML “Wake Vision” dataset. Our experiments show that across varying time and hardware constraints, Data Aware Neural Architecture Search consistently discovers superior TinyML systems compared to purely architecture-focused methods, underscoring the critical role of data-aware optimization in advancing TinyML.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Statement of problem
Different instruments have been used to measure the marginal gaps of crowns in vitro. However, a comprehensive systematic review is lacking.
Purpose
The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing literature on the instruments used for the in vitro marginal gap measurement of ceramic single crowns before cementation and to determine whether the crown material and method of fabrication influenced the marginal gap.
Material and methods
The search was conducted in 2024 across the EBSCO Host, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and predefined eligibility criteria. Eligible articles were screened to evaluate 6 instruments for measuring crown marginal gaps: direct view microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, impression replica, cross-sectioning, microcomputed tomography, and 3-dimensional (3D) superimposition. The normality of the data was assessed by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the differences in mean marginal gap were statistically evaluated using the Welch ANOVA (α=.05).
Results
Ninety-two articles were included, with 77 documenting single measurement instruments and 15 using a combination of 2 or more measurement instruments. Direct view microscopy was the most used instrument and appeared in 31 (40%) of the studies. No significant differences in mean marginal gap (F=2.09, P=.077) were found across the 6 measurement instruments. Across all studies, excluding those using 3D superimposition, the mean ±standard deviation number of marginal gap measurements per crown was 34.3 ±50.6. Among the 77 studies using a single measurement instrument, 64 used computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology to fabricate the crowns. CAD-CAM crowns had a mean ±standard deviation marginal gap of 78.9 ±28.6 µm (n=64) compared with 71.6 ±29.5 µm (n=13) for crowns manufactured using conventional methods. Zirconia and lithium disilicate were the most researched materials. Zirconia crowns recorded a mean ±standard deviation marginal gap of 69.4 ±34.2 µm for 972 crowns, which was significantly different (P=.045) from lithium disilicate with a mean ±standard deviation marginal gap of 92.2 ±42.5 µm for 602 crowns.
Conclusions
Direct view microscopy was the most used marginal gap measurement instrument for ceramic single crowns before cementation, and CAD-CAM was the most used crown fabrication method. No significant differences in mean marginal gap were found among the 6 marginal gap measurement instruments.}

abstract = {Introduction A definitive cure for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains elusive. Inter and Intra-patient heterogeneity in antigen expression profiles is a major challenge for AML treatment. Adapter CAR-T cell therapies utilize a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which binds to a non-natural small molecule, which in turn can be attached to a soluble affinity domain that binds the tumor antigen. Decoupling cancer cell binding and CAR engagement provides flexibility and control in directing the CAR-T therapy through dosing of the adapter, which can improve safety and decrease T cell exhaustion. A critical challenge for the success of adapter CAR-T is finding an ideal adapter molecule. Antibodies and antibody-derived molecules have been used, but this strategy is sub-optimal. Labeling antibodies with small molecules is not site-specific and only a portion of the small molecule will be in the correct orientation to activate the CAR-T. In addition, these natural proteins present a number of flaws including low stability, high internalization, and poor tumor penetrance. De novo designed miniproteins are a novel therapeutic modality. They are approximately 45 amino acids in length and adopt a highly stable tertiary structure, are easily produced recombinantly or synthetically, and present many additional advantages over traditional biologics. The structure of the miniprotein is created from scratch using generative artificial intelligence and is therefore controllable, permitting specific design of the conjugation site, as well as precise tuning the affinity. The small size, high solubility, and compact structure confers better biodistribution and lower internalization in the tumor cell surface. Additionally, de novo-designed miniproteins are superior to any biologic on the manufacturing side, since they can be expressed on common hosts, easily purified, and conjugated to small molecules efficiently and specifically using harsh methods that would denature or destroy a natural protein. Here, we show that miniproteins outperform antibodies as the targeting moiety of an adapter CAR-T therapy, and we demonstrate this using CD123 directed treatment of AML. Results We engineered AIP26GQ, a 5.6 kDa miniprotein that binds selectively to CD123 with KD = 0.5 pM. AIP26GQ is thermostable, able to be produced recombinantly from Escherichia coli or using solid phase peptide synthesis, and conjugated to a fluorescein molecule (FITC) via an engineered lysine residue. We demonstrated that AIP26GQ can direct anti-FITC CAR-T cells to kill AML model cell lines (MV-4-11) in vitro. We evaluated multiple positions for selective attachment of FITC, and identified the optimal geometric orientation for maximizing CAR-T activation. In vivo efficacy studies using MV-4-11 in NCG mice showed that AIP26GQ-directed CAR-T treatment reduces tumor burden to background levels and the remission is stable at least 15 days after the last dose. In the same study, a talacotuzumab antibody based adapter molecule and a direct anti-CD123 CAR-T were used for comparison. The miniprotein-directed CAR exhibited multiple advantages over both the antibody and the direct CAR-T, including increased efficacy with lower dose required of both the adapter and the CAR-T cells, improved tumor occupation, and less CAR-T exhaustion. Conclusions Our system combining a FITC-conjugated miniprotein with anti-FITC CAR-T cells yields complete remission in an MV-4-11 xenograft mice model, outperforming both an antibody adapter and direct CAR-T approaches. We demonstrated that the use of controllable CAR-T cells combined with miniprotein adapters exhibits an unprecedented potential for the design of dosable, redirectable and multiplexable cancer treatments.}

The role of MR imaging in patients with cognitive impairment is to evaluate each component of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), small vessel disease (SVD), and glymphatic function. We want to validate the diagnostic performance of the comprehensive interpretation of these parameters to predict the cognitive impairment stage.
Materials and Methods
This retrospective single-center study included 359 patients with cognitive impairment who had undergone MRI (FLAIR, T2WI, 3D-T1WI, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) and a neuropsychological screening battery between January 2020 and July 2022. Each AD and SVD-related MR parameter was visually evaluated, and DTI analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index was calculated. Volumetry analysis was performed using Neurophet AQUA AI-based software. Using logistic regression analysis, four types of models were developed and compared by adding the components in the following order: (1) clinical factors and AD, (2) SVD, (3) glymphatic function-related MR parameters, and (4) volumetric data. Chi-square automatic interaction detection algorithm was used to develop diagnostic tree analysis (DTA) model to predict late-stage cognitive impairment.
Results
APOE4 status, years of education, medial temporal lobe atrophy score, Fazekas scale score, DTI-ALPS index, and white matter hyperintensity were significant predictors of late-stage cognitive impairment. The performance of the prediction model increased from Model 1 to Model 4 (AUC: 0.880, 0.899, 0.914, and 0.945, respectively). The overall accuracy of the DTA model was 87.47%.
Conclusion
Integrative brain MRI assessments in patients with cognitive impairment, AD, SVD, and glymphatic function-related MR parameters, improve the prediction of late-stage cognitive impairment.}

An online questionnaire evaluated their perception and impressions, as well as literacy levels about ChatGPT, together with its proper applications in this professional field of study. Based on the awareness levels of ChatGPT, participants were split into two groups for comparison. It was revealed that a sizable proportion of students (62.55%) were unaware of the concepts and their use. However, students with prior experience using ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of awareness. Nonetheless, on pharmacy-related issues, only 57.7% of participants thought that ChatGPT's responses and information were either somewhat or to some extent appropriate. However, a number of participants (52.3%) had doubts and worries regarding the using ChatGPT. The majority of the participants (78.0%) thought that ChatGPT would have a beneficial effect on pharmacy education regardless of the pending concerns. Only 1.2% and 2.7% of total participants correctly identified the problematic and appropriate applications of ChatGPT, respectively, which indicated an insufficient literacy and ethical awareness about the use of ChatGPT.

Further, the order of the MADM items was changed to improve the understanding of decision-making.
Discussion
Primarily, the discussion concerns how decision-making can be understood in the context of maternity care and why women's understanding of decision-making in Danish maternity care in the MADM scale items was challenged.
Conclusion
The qualitative pilot test using cognitive interviews after translation of the instruments was a valuable method for cultural adaptation providing important knowledge on women's understanding and perceptions of item contents. The cognitive interviews provided a comprehensive understanding of decision-making and contributed to a thoroughly worked Danish version of the MADM and MORi instruments.}

abstract = {Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for clinical decision support, but their real-world performance varies. We compared three leading models (OpenAI's “o1” Large Reasoning Model (LRM), Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Meta's Llama-3.2–70B) to human experts in an emergency internal medicine setting.
Methods
We conducted a prospective comparative study on 73 anonymized patient cases from the Emergency Internal Medicine ward of the University Hospital Split, Croatia (June–September 2024). Two independent internal medicine specialists, blinded to model identity, graded the LLM-generated reports in two steps: (1) they evaluated the relevance of recommended diagnostic tests based on the patient's signs, symptoms, and medical history; (2) after reviewing the actual diagnostic test results, they assessed each model's final diagnosis, therapy plan, and follow-up recommendations. The same evaluative framework was applied to human-authored reports. Likert scales (1–4 or 1–3) were used, and statistical comparisons included the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
Results
The o1 model achieved a mean final rating (3.63) statistically indistinguishable from human physicians (3.67; p = 0.62). Claude-3.5-Sonnet (3.38) and Llama-3.2–70B (3.23) scored significantly lower (p < 0.01 vs. o1), largely due to errors in therapy planning and non-medication recommendations. Despite this gap, all three models demonstrated ≥90 % accuracy in final diagnoses and patient admission decisions. The o1 model correctly classified all abnormal lab values (100 %), while Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Llama-3.2–70B showed minor errors (99.5 % and 99 % accuracy, respectively).
Conclusions
When evaluated on real-world emergency cases, an advanced LLM with enhanced reasoning (o1) can match expert-level clinical performance, underscoring its potential utility as a decision-support tool.}

However, its efficacy remains controversial. This study hypothesized that a single acupressure on ST36 attenuates sympathetic nerve activity and mitigate skin vasoconstriction in response to cold stimulation. Twelve participants received either 5-min acupressure or sham pressure in the right ST36; subsequently, their left hand was immersed in cold water (10°C) for 10 min. Heart rate (HR), arterial pressure, skin temperature, and blood flow in both fingers were monitored. Autonomic nerve activity was assessed by HR variability. Water immersion decreased skin temperature and blood flow in both fingers with an increase in arterial pressure. However, there were no differences in these values or HR variability between the acupressure and sham trials. Acupressure on ST36 affected neither sympathetic nerve activity nor skin vasoconstrictive response during cold-water immersion.}

The proposed framework integrates ChatGPT into the complete machine learning pipeline, including data pre-processing, determining importance of characteristics, model recommendation and selection based on learning from reference studies, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The LLM-driven approach involves iterative refinement of the model through structured prompts, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to the specific requirements of the SOH estimation. The study utilized a publicly available dataset of a lithium-ion battery used in the propulsion system of an eVTOL vehicle, which includes comprehensive flight missions and structured charge–discharge cycles. Three machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were implemented and optimized using ChatGPT. The performance of the LLM-driven models was benchmarked against conventional methods, demonstrating a 52% reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to traditional approaches. The findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven machine learning in enhancing battery health prediction, making advanced techniques more accessible to a broader audience.

abstract = {Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, overwhelming healthcare systems. Numerous clinical trials have explored the efficacy of Chinese herbal formulae (CHFs) in treating COVID-19, resulting in a surge of systematic reviews (SRs). This review critically evaluates the additive effectiveness of CHFs for COVID-19, aiming to provide a robust foundation for high-quality research and integrated therapeutic strategies.
Methods
This PRISMA-compliant review was registered on PROSPERO. We included SRs assessed oral CHFs combined with guideline recommended Standard Treatment (ST), versus ST in patients with COVID-19 patients. Primary outcomes included clinical improvement (e.g., days without ventilator support) and deterioration (e.g., new need for oxygen therapy). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Sinomed, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP were searched from inception to July 1, 2024, for SRs (Cochrane/non-Cochrane) of RCTs reporting predefined outcomes. Secondary meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.3, with methodological quality and evidence certainty assessed via AMSTAR-II and GRADE.
Results
Eight SRs (6860 cases) were included. Meta-analyses showed that CHF combined with ST outperformed ST alone in reducing all-cause mortality (RR = 0.27, 95 %CI [0.08–0.96], P = 0.04), adverse events (RR = 0.34, 95 %CI [0.20–0.59], P < 0.0001), severe case conversion (RR = 0.33, 95 %CI [0.17–0.66], P = 0.002), and improving pulmonary imaging (RR = 1.28, 95 %CI [1.12–1.46], P = 0.0003). No significant differences were observed in clinical symptom recovery rates (cough) or recovery times (cough and fatigue). Bubble plots suggested weak to moderate effects of specific CHFs (e.g., Buzhongyiqi Decoction, Maxingshigan-Weijing Decoction) on viral clearance, severe case conversion, adverse events, and pulmonary imaging.
Conclusion
Comprehensive analyses indicated that CHFs showed good add-on effect in treating COVID-19. However, it is important to note that the overall quality of evidence in these studies is generally low, and further high-quality clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.}

For efficient phosphate recovery, different organic ligands are calcined herein using the metal-organic framework (MOF) template sacrificial method to synthesize nano-magnesium oxides (MgOs) with varying morphologies, pore structures, and vacancie concentrations (oxygen vacancy and Mg vacancy). 2,5-Dihydroxyterephthalic acid (DHTA)-MgO, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC)-MgO, and adipic acid (AA)-MgO primarily rely on chemical adsorption, supplemented by physical adsorption. AA-MgO exhibits an adsorption capacity of 323.9 mg P/L for phosphate at pH8, which is 3.89 and 1.09 times higher than those of DHTA-MgO and H3BTC-MgO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations (DFT) confirm that the main mechanisms involved in phosphate adsorption are ligand exchange, intraspherical complexation, and electrostatic attraction. Moreover, the main phosphate adsorption sites on AA-MgO are oxygen vacancy, Mg, and Mg vacancy. When the inorganic phosphorus concentration = 38.39 ± 0.2 mg P/L, AA-MgO dosage = 1.2 g/L, the removal rate of phosphate in livestock wastewater reaches 100 %. Thus, the proposed method can be beneficial for improving the quality of acidic water bodies. This study provides a new approach for phosphate removal from livestock wastewater.}

Addressing this challenge requires the development of novel anti-TB drug molecules. This study employed de novo drug design approaches to explore new EthR ligands and ethionamide boosters targeting the crucial enzyme InhA involved in mycolic acid synthesis in Mtb. Leveraging REINVENT4, a modern open-source generative AI framework, the study utilized various optimization algorithms such as transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and curriculum learning to design small molecules with desired properties. Specifically, focus was placed on molecule optimization using the Mol2Mol option, which offers multinomial sampling with beam search. The study's findings highlight the identification of six promising compounds exhibiting enhanced activity and improved physicochemical properties through structure-based drug design and optimization efforts. These compounds offer potential candidates for further preclinical and clinical development as novel therapeutics for TB treatment, providing new avenues for combating drug-resistant TB strains and improving patient outcomes.}

This study has investigated how drivers from the general population are willing to share their driving with persons with disabilities. In order to obtain a clearer image, three groups of disability types were considered: persons with physical disabilities, hearing impairments, and visual impairments. The research was performed on 1,064 valid drivers (42.9% females) in Serbia. The most attractive category of persons with disabilities with whom drivers were willing to share their ride was persons with hearing impairments. We identified simplicity and altruism as key factors that influenced drivers’ intentions to share rides with persons with disabilities. Better results for persons with hearing impairments could be expected if the focus were on employed females. Highly educated drivers in urban areas could serve as a promising focus group for measures aimed at persons with visual impairments. Finally, we proposed specific measures to support decision-makers in implementing ridesharing solutions for persons with disabilities.}

Without co-exposure, P. velutina completely decolorizes RB5 within 9 days. The highest inhibitory effect was found for soluble CdCl2 with an EC50 of 583 μg l−1, followed by MPA-QDs (10,628 μg l−1) and NAC-QDs (17,575 μg l−1). The different EC50 values indicate that the nanoparticle coatings have a strong influence on the inhibitory effects, as the organic ligands used for surface passivation prevented the leaching of acute toxic Cd ions from the metallic QD core. Compared to CdCl2, the CdTe QDs were less inhibitory to the formation of fungal metabolites and their decolorization ability on co-exposed textile dyes. In addition, the literature comparison suggests that P. velutina is more resilient to cadmium than other microorganisms. The fungus could therefore be used for bioremediation applications of dye- or QD-contaminated wastewater from the textile or semiconductor industries.}

abstract = {Objectives
The chemokine CCL22 is recognized for recruiting immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells (Treg) that contribute to disease progression in various tumor entities helping them to evade the host immune response. Our study aims to identify the expressing cell types and to evaluate the prognostic significance of CCL22 secretion and its association with Treg invasion in endometrial cancer (EC), an immunogenic cancer.
Methods
Specimens from 275 patients with EC and 28 healthy controls were screened immunohistochemically for CCL22. Immunofluorescence double-staining for CCL22 and different immune cell markers was performed. In vitro regulation of CCL22-expression was examined in EC cell lines (Ishikawa+, RL95–2) and human PBMCs in coculture settings via qPCR and ELISA.
Results
Elevated CCL22 staining in tumor cells and CCL22-positive M1-macrophages in tumordistant areas were significantly associated with increased overall survival (OS). Conversely, high, secretory-appearing staining in the peritumoral and intratumoral stroma correlated with reduced OS. Although the analysis of the in vitro coculture model of epithelial tumor- and immune cells revealed PBMCs as the primary source of CCL22, we could confirm expression of the chemokine also in the EC epithelial cells.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that CCL22 in EC is associated with OS, dependent on its location and the cell type producing it. Intracellular upregulation and extracellular secretion must be considered separately when investigating CCL22 expressing cell types in EC. These results may provide evidence for CCL22-mediated Treg recruitment in EC as a potential future therapeutic target.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a barrage of false, misleading, and manipulated information that inhibited effective pandemic response and led to thousands of preventable deaths. Recognition of the urgent public health threat posed by this infodemic led to the development of numerous infodemic management interventions by a wide range of actors. The need to respond rapidly and with limited information sometimes came at the expense of strategy and conceptual rigor. Given limited funding for public health communication and growing politicization of countermisinformation efforts, responses to future infodemics should be informed by a systematic and conceptually grounded evaluation of the successes and shortcomings of existing interventions to ensure credibility of the field and evidence-based action.
Objectives
This study sought to identify gaps and opportunities in existing infodemic management interventions and to assess the use of public health frameworks to structure responses to infodemics.
Methods
We expanded a previously developed dataset of infodemic management interventions, spanning guidelines, policies, and tools from governments, academic institutions, nonprofits, media companies, and other organizations, with 379 interventions included in total. We applied framework analysis to describe and interpret patterns within these interventions through their alignment with codes derived from 3 frameworks selected for their prominence in public health and infodemic-related scholarly discourse: the epidemiological model, the socioecological model, and the environmental health framework.
Results
The epidemiological model revealed the need for rigorous, transparent risk assessments to triage misinformation. The socioecological model demonstrated an opportunity for greater coordination across levels of influence, with only 11% of interventions receiving multiple socioecological codes, and more robust partnerships with existing organizations. The environmental health framework showed that sustained approaches that comprehensively address all influences on the information environment are needed, representing only 19% of the dataset.
Conclusions
Responses to future infodemics would benefit from cross-sector coordination, adoption of measurable and meaningful goals, and alignment with public health frameworks, which provide critical conceptual grounding for infodemic response approaches and ensure comprehensiveness of approach. Beyond individual interventions, a funded coordination mechanism can provide overarching strategic direction and promote collaboration.}

Our analysis revealed a peculiar lack of significant findings in quantitative measures (e.g., mean occurrences and durations); on the contrary, highly significant sex-based differences concerning the temporal organization of behavior and the overall behavioral organization were observed. Our results suggest that adolescents female exhibited behaviors less constrained by the anxiety-related patterns observed in their male counterparts. These findings underscore the crucial role of adolescence in shaping key developmental dynamics, such as motivation, exploration, and anxiety regulation, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of how these processes evolve differently between the sexes during this critical period of development.}

Health care providers and recipients have been using artificial intelligence and its subfields, such as natural language processing and machine learning technologies, in the form of search engines to obtain medical information for some time now. Although a search engine returns a ranked list of webpages in response to a query and allows the user to obtain information from those links directly, ChatGPT has elevated the interface between humans with artificial intelligence by attempting to provide relevant information in a human-like textual conversation. This technology is being adopted rapidly and has enormous potential to impact various aspects of health care, including patient education, research, scientific writing, pre-visit/post-visit queries, documentation assistance, and more. The objective of this study is to assess whether chatbots could assist with answering patient questions and electronic health record inbox management.
Methods
We devised two questionnaires: (1) administrative and non-complex medical questions (based on actual inbox questions); and (2) complex medical questions on the topic of chronic venous disease. We graded the performance of publicly available chatbots regarding their potential to assist with electronic health record inbox management. The study was graded by an internist and a vascular medicine specialist independently.

abstract = {Introduction
With the advent of FLASH radiotherapy, alanine dosimetry has gained attention as a promising dosimeter owing to its dose-rate independence. However, before utilized in radiotherapy, procedures for determining the absorbed dose to water using alanine under clinical proton beams must be established. This study sought to develop a formula for alanine dosimetry by deriving beam quality correction factors and validating them through Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements.
Materials and Methods
To calculate the absorbed dose to water using alanine dosimeters, a formula was developed specifically for the plateau region. Alanine dosimeters were irradiated under both a reference beam (Cobalt-60) and clinical proton beams. Beam quality correction factors were calculated and subsequently validated through Monte Carlo simulations using the Tool for Particle Simulation (TOPAS), which is based on GEANT4, as well as through experimental measurements. During the simulations, both crystalline and bulk densities of alanine were considered.
Results
The simulation results showed that the average beam quality correction factors for alanine were 1.005 for crystalline density and 1.012 for bulk density. Experimental measurements under clinical proton beams yielded a beam quality correction factor of 1.014, with a standard uncertainty of 2.2%.
Conclusions
These results suggest that alanine dosimeters provide reliable and reproducible measurements for proton therapy. The robust methodology demonstrated here highlights the potential of alanine dosimeters in clinical applications, demonstrating their effectiveness and reliability in determining the absorbed dose to water under clinical proton beam conditions.}

However, single-stage networks often yield suboptimal results with blurred textures and structural distortion, while existing progressive strategies struggle to effectively balance local and global information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative adversarial model that progressively reconstructs mural details by adaptively integrating multi-scale local features and global context based on damage severity. We first obtain initial coarse results using an encoder-decoder network. Then, a mask-guided network adaptively extracts and fuses local features according to damage levels. Next, multi-level residual learning further refines details at different scales. Finally, a global network captures overall artistic characteristics using an optimized Transformer-UNet architecture. In this way, our method harmonizes detailed local restoration with the preservation of overall artistic integrity throughout the progressive inpainting process. Extensive experiments on multiple mural datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of texture clarity and structural coherence.

In order to overcome the challenges of inadequate classification accuracy in existing fake cybersecurity threat intelligence mining methods and the lack of high-quality public datasets for training classification models, we propose a novel approach that significantly advances the field. We improved the attention mechanism and designed a generative adversarial network based on the improved attention mechanism to generate fake cybersecurity threat intelligence. Additionally, we refine text tokenization techniques and design a detection model to detect fake cybersecurity threats intelligence. Using our STIX-CTIs dataset, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy of 96.1%, outperforming current text classification models. Through the utilization of our generated fake cybersecurity threat intelligence, we successfully mimic data poisoning attacks within open-source communities. When paired with our detection model, this research not only improves detection accuracy but also provides a powerful tool for enhancing the security and integrity of open-source ecosystems.}

abstract = {Background
Communication among health care professionals is essential for the delivery of safe clinical care. Secure messaging has rapidly emerged as a new mode of asynchronous communication. Despite its popularity, relatively little is known about how secure messaging is used and how such use contributes to communication burden.
Objective
This study aims to characterize the use of an electronic health record–integrated secure messaging platform across 14 hospitals and 263 outpatient clinics within a large health care system.
Methods
We collected metadata on the use of the Epic Systems Secure Chat platform for 6 months (July 2022 to January 2023). Information was retrieved on message volume, response times, message characteristics, messages sent and received by users, user roles, and work settings (inpatient vs outpatient).
Results
A total of 32,881 users sent 9,639,149 messages during the study. Median daily message volume was 53,951 during the first 2 weeks of the study and 69,526 during the last 2 weeks, resulting in an overall increase of 29% (P=.03). Nurses were the most frequent users of secure messaging (3,884,270/9,639,149, 40% messages), followed by physicians (2,387,634/9,639,149, 25% messages), and medical assistants (1,135,577/9,639,149, 12% messages). Daily message frequency varied across users; inpatient advanced practice providers and social workers interacted with the highest number of messages per day (median 19). Conversations were predominantly between 2 users (1,258,036/1,547,879, 81% conversations), with a median of 2 conversational turns and a median response time of 2.4 minutes. The largest proportion of inpatient messages was from nurses to physicians (972,243/4,749,186, 20% messages) and physicians to nurses (606,576/4,749,186, 13% messages), while the largest proportion of outpatient messages was from physicians to nurses (344,048/2,192,488, 16% messages) and medical assistants to other medical assistants (236,694/2,192,488, 11% messages).
Conclusions
Secure messaging was widely used by a diverse range of health care professionals, with ongoing growth throughout the study and many users interacting with more than 20 messages per day. The short message response times and high messaging volume observed highlight the interruptive nature of secure messaging, raising questions about its potentially harmful effects on clinician workflow, cognition, and errors.}

Design/methodology/approach
PE is a new job category in the fields of technology and artificial intelligence. Prompt engineers use various approaches to elicit the best possible outputs from large language module technologies such as ChatGPT. This column examines the various elements present in effective prompts and how the skills, knowledge and abilities relate to the work that librarians already do, where there are disruptions and how the field of library and information science may approach studying the emergence and effectiveness of PE in resolving information needs.
Findings
While PE shares many of the goals, procedures and skillsets that librarians already know and use, it is a disruption in information-seeking processes. It is a highly complex undertaking that requires a mix of knowledge, skills and abilities. If done well, PE will allow information seekers to achieve a whole new level of results both in terms of the information retrieved and the content that is produced based on that information.
Originality/value
Librarians are currently generally not considered to be prime candidates for PE positions. However, this column introduces the idea that many librarians already have the knowledge, skills, abilities and aptitude to do PE. This may be as prompt engineers or by integrating PE into their existing professional practice.}

abstract = {Introduction
Fatigue is common and burdensome in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), yet pharmacological treatments offer limited relief. Exercise is gaining attention as a non-pharmacological strategy, and resistance training is increasingly recommended. However, Tai Chi—a traditional Chinese exercise—has not yet been evaluated in this population. This study compared the effects of Tai Chi and resistance training on multiple outcomes in patients with UC.
Methods
This single-center, evaluator-blind, three-arm randomized clinical trial block-randomized 75 patients with UC to 12 weeks of Tai Chi or resistance training and a control group involving standard treatment and care with general exercise advice. Eligible participants had fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score ≥ 40) and were in remission or had mild-to-moderate disease activity (Modified Mayo score ≤ 10). The primary outcome was fatigue, secondary outcomes included handgrip strength (HGS), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life, all strongly associated with fatigue.
Results
The three groups showed significant differences in total fatigue and in general, physical, and mental fatigue subdimensions. Compared with the control group, fatigue improved in both the Tai Chi group (mean difference:8.90 [95 % confidence interval [CI], -15.11 to -2.69]) and the resistance training group (mean difference:7.00 [95 % CI, -13.16 to -0.84]), with no significant differences between them. However, between the two interventions, Tai Chi showed numerically greater improvements in anxiety, depression, and emotional function, while resistance training led to greater improvements in HGS (mean difference: 7.50 [95 % CI, 2.37 to 12.63]) and SMI (mean difference: 0.54 [95 % CI, 0.01 to 1.08]). No adverse events occurred, except for one case of mild abdominal discomfort in the resistance training group, which resolved with rest.
Conclusions
Both Tai Chi and resistance training effectively reduced fatigue and improved related outcomes in UC patients. Tai Chi may be more beneficial for psychological symptoms, while resistance training showed greater improvements in physical strength. Given their complementary advantages and safety, both may serve as valuable non-pharmacological options in UC management. Future studies should explore their integration into long-term, multimodal treatment strategies.

Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23 %.

Our analysis of 20 studies showed significant associations between exposure to these pollutants and increased asthma incidence and prevalence, particularly in children. Specifically, pollutants such as elemental carbon (EC), benzene, NO2, PM10, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were found to be significantly associated with asthma development in children, while NO2 and PM2.5 were linked to asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Additionally, hospitalizations and emergency room visits were positively correlated with exposure to PM2.5 and O3 in both children and adults, and the elderly showed significant associations with O3 exposure. Although asthma-related mortality was not directly linked to specific pollutants, a few studies indicated a broader association between exposure to pollutants like NO2 and PM2.5 and increased overall mortality. These findings highlight the importance of reducing exposure to outdoor air pollutants to mitigate asthma risk and improve public health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.
Resumen
El asma es una enfermedad pulmonar crónica que afecta a personas de todas las edades, contribuyendo a una morbimortalidad significativa. La exposición a contaminantes atmosféricos es un factor clave tanto en el desarrollo como en la exacerbación de los síntomas del asma. Este estudio revisa el impacto de los principales contaminantes del aire, incluyendo dióxido de nitrógeno (NO2), material particulado con un diámetro ≤2,5μm (PM2,5) o ≤10μm (PM10), y ozono (O3), sobre los resultados del asma. Nuestro análisis de 20 estudios muestra asociaciones significativas entre la exposición a estos contaminantes y un aumento en la incidencia y prevalencia del asma, especialmente en niños. En particular, contaminantes como el carbono elemental (EC), el benceno, el NO2, el PM10 y el dióxido de azufre (SO2) se asociaron significativamente con el desarrollo del asma en niños, mientras que el NO2 y el PM2,5 se vinculaban con exacerbaciones del asma tanto en niños como en adultos. Además, se encontraron correlaciones positivas entre las hospitalizaciones y las visitas a urgencias con la exposición a PM2,5 y O3 en niños y adultos, y los ancianos mostraron asociaciones significativas con la exposición a O3. Aunque la mortalidad relacionada con el asma no se vinculó directamente a contaminantes específicos, algunos estudios indicaron una asociación más amplia entre la exposición a contaminantes como NO2 y PM2,5 y un aumento en la mortalidad general. Estos hallazgos resaltan la importancia de reducir la exposición a contaminantes atmosféricos exteriores para mitigar el riesgo de asma y mejorar los resultados en salud pública, especialmente en poblaciones vulnerables como niños y ancianos.}

abstract = {This paper presents a personalized lecture concept using educational blocks and its demonstrative application in a new university lecture. Higher education faces daily challenges: deep and specialized knowledge is available from everywhere and accessible to almost everyone. University lecturers of specialized master courses confront the problem that their lectures are either too boring or too complex for the attending students. Additionally, curricula are changing more rapidly than they have in the past 10–30 years. The German education system comprises different educational forms, with universities providing less practical content. Consequently, many university students do not obtain the practical skills they should ideally gain through university lectures. Therefore, in this work, a new lecture concept is proposed based on the extension of the just-in-time teaching paradigm: Personalized and Demand-Based Education. This concept includes: 1) an initial assessment of students’ backgrounds, 2) selecting the appropriate educational blocks, and 3) collecting ongoing feedback during the semester. The feedback was gathered via Pingo, ensuring anonymity for the students. Our concept was exemplarily tested in the new lecture ”Practical Tools for Control Engineers” at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The initial results indicate that our proposed concept could be beneficial in addressing the current challenges in higher education.}

To gather the perspectives of APS ACTION members regarding the strengths and limitations of Damage Index for Antiphospholipid Syndrome (DIAPS); and establish recommendations for the improvement of DIAPS.
Methods
APS ACTION members were invited to answer a survey regarding their satisfaction with DIAPS scoring system and individual items. The level of agreement (LoA) among members with the inclusion of individual items in DIAPS was calculated (LoA of <75% was considered disagreement). Respondents’ open-ended comments about DIAPS limitations were also collected, which helped formulate our recommendations for DIAPS improvement.
Results
Forty-two APS ACTION members (58.3%) answered the survey. Of them, 26 (61.9%) were satisfied, 4 (9.5%) were neutral, and 12 (28.6%) were dissatisfied with the current DIAPS scoring system. Fifteen items (39.5%) presented a LoA <75% regarding the inclusion in DIAPS. Respondents provided comments that were grouped under six main categories related to concerns about: a) definitions and attribution of damage (including causality and temporal relationship); b) scoring system; c) overlapping items; d) specific items (exclusion of redundant items and inclusion of additional ones); e) the need to incorporate multiple events; and f) feasibility and practicality. Finally, the APS ACTION “Damage” Working Group developed 7 recommendations that should be considered for the next generation DIAPS.
Conclusion
Approximately 60% of respondents were satisfied with DIAPS and its definitions; however, our survey demonstrated that there is substantial room to improve the current damage index for APS. Efforts for updating DIAPS should consider the APS ACTION “Damage” Working Group recommendations.}

abstract = {Virtual fencing presents a promising solution for grazing management, providing flexibility, individual monitoring, potential improvements in land management, and enhanced animal welfare. However, welfare issues related to electric stimuli and species-specific learning abilities need consideration. This study aimed to investigate if sheep could learn and be fenced by a fully automated virtual fencing system. Eight Norwegian White ewes with twin lambs, all naïve to virtual fencing, were randomly selected at the beginning of September 2018. Fitted with Nofence virtual fence collars designed for goats, the ewes were subjected to daily behavioural observations over nine days. The Nofence technology is a fully automated system that uses GPS coordinates, that trigger an audio cue when an animal crosses the boundary. If the animal does not turn, it receives an electric stimulus. The study was divided into three periods: an adaptation period (2 days), period 1 (5 days), where the first virtual boundary was introduced on day 1, and period 2 (4 days) when a second boundary was introduced. Additionally, the ewes wore heart rate monitors for at least one hour daily. Throughout the study, the ewes received a total of 218 audio cues and 38 electric stimuli, indicating an approximate individual mean of 27 audio cues and 5 electric stimuli received The number of audio cues and electric stimuli significantly decreased over days in both experimental periods. In period 2, the number of audio cues was significantly higher compared to period 1, while the success ratio in avoiding electric stimuli remained stable across days. The experimental period significantly influenced the frequency of standing/walking behaviour, being more common in the adaptation period compared to periods 1 and 2. However, the period did not have a significant effect on the percentages of lying or grazing behaviour. During heart rate monitoring, four ewes received one electric stimulus each, resulting in an immediate heart rate increase that returned to baseline within minutes. The present study demonstrates that sheep wearing a fully automated system quickly learned to associate audio cues with electric stimuli. The ability to generalise experiences from one virtual boundary to another emphasises their learning ability. Minor changes in activity were likely influenced by factors other than the virtual fencing system. The short-lasting increase in heart rate as a response to electric stimuli suggests a temporary stress reaction. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of virtual fencing for sheep management.}

abstract = {Background
Medical abstract sentence classification is crucial for enhancing medical database searches, literature reviews, and generating new abstracts. However, Chinese medical abstract classification research is hindered by a lack of suitable datasets. Given the vastness of Chinese medical literature and the unique value of traditional Chinese medicine, precise classification of these abstracts is vital for advancing global medical research.
Objective
This study aims to address the data scarcity issue by generating a large volume of labeled Chinese abstract sentences without manual annotation, thereby creating new training datasets. Additionally, we seek to develop more accurate text classification algorithms to improve the precision of Chinese medical abstract classification.
Methods
We developed 3 training datasets (dataset #1, dataset #2, and dataset #3) and a test dataset to evaluate our model. Dataset #1 contains 15,000 abstract sentences translated from the PubMed dataset into Chinese. Datasets #2 and #3, each with 15,000 sentences, were generated using GPT-3.5 from 40,000 Chinese medical abstracts in the CSL database. Dataset #2 used titles and keywords for pseudolabeling, while dataset #3 aligned abstracts with category labels. The test dataset includes 87,000 sentences from 20,000 abstracts. We used SBERT embeddings for deeper semantic analysis and evaluated our model using clustering (SBERT-DocSCAN) and supervised methods (SBERT-MEC). Extensive ablation studies and feature analyses were conducted to validate the model’s effectiveness and robustness.
Results
Our experiments involved training both clustering and supervised models on the 3 datasets, followed by comprehensive evaluation using the test dataset. The outcomes demonstrated that our models outperformed the baseline metrics. Specifically, when trained on dataset #1, the SBERT-DocSCAN model registered an impressive accuracy and F1-score of 89.85% on the test dataset. Concurrently, the SBERT-MEC algorithm exhibited comparable performance with an accuracy of 89.38% and an identical F1-score. Training on dataset #2 yielded similarly positive results for the SBERT-DocSCAN model, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of 89.83%, while the SBERT-MEC algorithm recorded an accuracy of 86.73% and an F1-score of 86.51%. Notably, training with dataset #3 allowed the SBERT-DocSCAN model to attain the best with an accuracy and F1-score of 91.30%, whereas the SBERT-MEC algorithm also showed robust performance, obtaining an accuracy of 90.39% and an F1-score of 90.35%. Ablation analysis highlighted the critical role of integrated features and methodologies in improving classification efficiency.
Conclusions
Our approach addresses the challenge of limited datasets for Chinese medical abstract classification by generating novel datasets. The deployment of SBERT-DocSCAN and SBERT-MEC models significantly enhances the precision of classifying Chinese medical abstracts, even when using synthetic datasets with pseudolabels.}

UAVs capture high-resolution images but have a limited collection range, leading to higher costs per acre. In contrast, airplane imagery is more cost-effective and covers larger areas but typically provides lower spatial resolution (15–50 cm), which is inadequate for assessing specialty crops. For example, Agroview, an AI-driven platform for plant inventories and plant-level analytics, requires high-resolution imagery (<10 cm/pixel) for optimal performance. This study aims to address this limitation by developing an agriculture intelligence generative adversarial network (AgI-GANs) to enhance airplane imagery (∼15 cm/pixel resolution) to resolutions comparable to UAV imagery (∼3.9 cm/pixel). The AgI-GAN-enhanced images significantly improved Agroview’s tree detection accuracy, reducing detection errors to below 10 %, with an average error of 4.11 % ± 4.5 across 10 citrus orchards, compared to 36.21 % ± 9 when using unenhanced airplane images. Additionally, cost analysis demonstrates that AgI-GAN-enhanced airplane imagery reduces data acquisition costs to approximately $2.44 per acre, a 60 % reduction from the $6.07 per acre cost associated with UAV data collection. This study highlights the transformative potential of AgI-GAN in precision agriculture, providing a cost-effective solution that combines the extensive coverage of airplane imagery with the high resolution required for precise data analytics, benefiting specialty crop growers and agricultural stakeholders.}

This membrane design stands out for its unique structure, consisting of a thin dense layer at its core and two graded porous substrates that adhere symmetrically to this middle layer. In comparison to previously reported PLNCG hollow fiber membranes, the GPSS membrane offers superior oxygen permeation flux, exceeding that of the hollow fiber membrane by more than four times. When using air as the feed gas and even when introducing CO2 into the feed gas or sweep gas, the membrane maintains a consistent oxygen permeation flux of 4.41 mL min−1 cm−2 (STP). This work demonstrates that by paying close attention to membrane structure, the oxygen permeation flux of flat membranes can surpass that of hollow fiber membranes. Given its exceptional oxygen separation performance, the PLNCG-GPSS membrane holds great potential for practical applications such as high-purity oxygen production, pure hydrogen production, oxygen-involved catalytical reactions, and CO2 capture and storage.}

The increasing demand for task-oriented chatbots has triggered the proposal of many tools for their construction, like Dialogflow, Lex, Rasa, or Watson. However, selecting the most appropriate one is difficult; the conceptual design behind a chatbot may become buried under the tool technicalities; and migration between chatbot development platforms must be done manually. To alleviate these problems, we propose a platform-independent design notation for task-oriented chatbots, based on the analysis of fifteen chatbot development platforms. Following model-driven engineering principles, the chatbot implementation is synthesised from the design, and designs can be extracted from the implementations, enabling the migration and re-engineering of chatbots. Moreover, a recommender suggests the most suitable platform for a given chatbot design, considering contextual factors. We have realised these ideas in Conga: an extensible web application featuring a design notation editor; a development platform recommender; platform-specific validators; and generators and parsers for Dialogflow and Rasa. We evaluated Conga over 291 Dialogflow and Rasa open-source chatbots, showing its expressiveness, portability, and usefulness for finding chatbot quality issues (found in 93,8% of the chatbots). Overall, our architecture enables neutral chatbot designs, automates migration, and provides mechanisms for defect detection at the design level.}

The use of large language models (LLMs) as writing assistance for medical professionals is a promising approach to reduce the time required for documentation, but there may be practical, ethical, and legal challenges in many jurisdictions complicating the use of the most powerful commercial LLM solutions.
Objective
In this study, we assessed the feasibility of using nonproprietary LLMs of the GPT variety as writing assistance for medical professionals in an on-premise setting with restricted compute resources, generating German medical text.
Methods
We trained four 7-billion–parameter models with 3 different architectures for our task and evaluated their performance using a powerful commercial LLM, namely Anthropic’s Claude-v2, as a rater. Based on this, we selected the best-performing model and evaluated its practical usability with 2 independent human raters on real-world data.
Results
In the automated evaluation with Claude-v2, BLOOM-CLP-German, a model trained from scratch on the German text, achieved the best results. In the manual evaluation by human experts, 95 (93.1%) of the 102 reports generated by that model were evaluated as usable as is or with only minor changes by both human raters.
Conclusions
The results show that even with restricted compute resources, it is possible to generate medical texts that are suitable for documentation in routine clinical practice. However, the target language should be considered in the model selection when processing non-English text.}

This study presents a novel colorimetric sensor for glyphosate based on inhibiting Fe/ZnO nanozyme activity. By doping with iron and modulating the growth process of Fe/Zn MOFs precursors with triethylamine (TEA), Fe/ZnO nanozymes with substantial active surfaces and abundant Fe active sites were derived. The Fe/ZnO possessed excellent peroxidase-like activities, measuring 15.3 and 7.5 times higher than those of the materials synthesized without iron doping (ZnO) and the use of TEA (Fe/ZnO-w), respectively. Glyphosate inhibited the enzyme-like activity of Fe/ZnO by adsorbing on its surface through electrostatic interaction and occupying its catalytic active site. Based on this mechanism, a colorimetric sensing assay was created to directly and selectively detect glyphosate. The linear range for glyphosate detection was 0.02 to 10 mg L−1, with a detection limit (3σ) of 15.6 μg L−1. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of real samples. Metal oxides derived from well-designed MOFs provide a simple and effective strategy for creating high-performing pesticide detection platforms.}

abstract = {In the steel manufacturing industry, it is crucial to automatically recognize semi-finished product numbers to avoid mix-ups and ensure that each product is processed according to its specific material properties. The advancement of deep learning has significantly improved the recognition of steel product numbers, particularly those printed by machines with consistent thickness and spacing, resulting in high recognition accuracy. Conversely, handwritten numbers by workers are often challenging to recognize due to varying thickness, spacing, being too thin, partially erased, or overwritten with scribbles. This inconsistency causes low recognition accuracy of steel product number recognition models for fonts with insufficient training data or fonts not seen during training. The models must be updated periodically whenever a new font is used and remain vulnerable to new fonts until sufficient data is accumulated and updated. In this paper, we propose a Font Changer that converts various fonts into a representative font to address these issues. Font Changer is designed to learn the trajectory from a Gaussian distribution to the data distribution of images generated in a representative font with clean background. Font Changer, composed of a conditional image encoder and a diffusion model, extracts location, size, and number information from the original image containing the steel product number. The extracted information is then used as a condition for the diffusion model, allowing it to generate the closest sample within the data distribution. Images processed by the Font Changer exhibit uniformity, ensuring the consistency of steel product number images. Experiments demonstrate that the Font Changer enhances number recognition by removing background noise and converting even messy and damaged images into a consistent representative font.

abstract = {Summary
Objective
Investigating the effect of semi-occluded vocal tract training with a free-end tube on acoustic characteristics and glottal performance in dysphonic adults.
Study Design
A systematic review.
Methods
This systematic review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was guided by the population, intervention, comparison, results and study design framework. Adults with dysphonia were included, while studies with psychiatric, cognitive, or cancer-related conditions were excluded. The intervention involved semi-occluded vocal tract training (SVOT) with a free-end straw, and outcomes included acoustic parameters (eg, jitter, shimmer, HNR, CPP, and F0) and contact quotient. A comprehensive search across multiple databases identified studies, and two independent reviewers screened and assessed them for inclusion. Bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB-2 tool, with results visualized via Robvis.
Results
This section outlines the inclusion of three studies with 127 participants from an initial pool of 5752 records. The studies varied in their methodologies, with one utilizing electroglottography evaluation and two employing acoustic assessments, while all reported different durations of vocal training. The Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool indicated a high risk of bias across the studies, primarily due to missing outcome data and randomization issues.
Conclusions
This systematic review highlights the beneficial effects of SVOT using a free-end tube in improving acoustic characteristics and glottal performance in dysphonic adults. The technique enhances vocal fold coordination, reduces tension, and promotes efficient phonation. Further research is recommended to explore its long-term effects and efficacy across various dysphonia subtypes.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Significant secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR) is associated with poor prognosis, but its heterogeneity makes predicting patient outcomes challenging. Our objective was to identify STR prognostic phenogroups.
Methods
We analyzed 758 patients with moderate-to-severe STR: 558 (74±14 years, 55% women) in the derivation cohort and 200 (73±12 years, 60% women) in the external validation cohort. The primary endpoint was a composite of heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
Results
We identified 3 phenogroups. The low-risk phenogroup (2-year event-free survival 80%, 95%CI, 74%-87%) had moderate STR, preserved right ventricular (RV) size and function, and a moderately dilated but normally functioning right atrium. The intermediate-risk phenogroup (HR, 2.20; 95%CI, 1.44-3.37; P<.001) included older patients with severe STR, and a mildly dilated but uncoupled RV. The high-risk phenogroup (HR, 4.67; 95%CI, 3.20-6.82; P<.001) included younger patients with massive-to-torrential tricuspid regurgitation, as well as severely dilated and dysfunctional RV and right atrium. Multivariable analysis confirmed the clustering as independently associated with the composite endpoint (HR, 1.40; 95%CI, 1.13-1.70; P=.002). A supervised machine learning model, developed to assist clinicians in assigning patients to the 3 phenogroups, demonstrated excellent performance both in the derivation cohort (accuracy=0.91, precision=0.91, recall=0.91, and F1 score=0.91) and in the validation cohort (accuracy=0.80, precision=0.78, recall=0.78, and F1 score=0.77).
Conclusions
The unsupervised cluster analysis identified 3 risk phenogroups, which could assist clinicians in developing more personalized treatment and follow-up strategies for STR patients.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La insuficiencia tricuspídea secundaria (ITS) significativa se asocia a un mal pronóstico, pero su heterogeneidad dificulta la predicción de los resultados de los pacientes. Nuestro objetivo fue identificar fenogrupos pronósticos de ITS.
Métodos
Se analizó a 758 pacientes con ITS moderada a grave: 558 (74±14 años, 55% mujeres) en la cohorte de derivación y 200 (73±12 años, 60% mujeres) en la cohorte de validación externa. El criterio de valoración principal fue una combinación de hospitalización por insuficiencia cardiaca y mortalidad por todas las causas.
Resultados
Se identificaron 3 fenogrupos. El fenogrupo de bajo riesgo (supervivencia libre de acontecimientos a 2 años 80%, IC95%, 74-87%) tenía ITS moderada, tamaño y función del ventrículo derecho (VD) conservados, y aurícula derecha moderadamente dilatada, pero con funcionamiento normal. El fenogrupo de riesgo intermedio (HR=2,20; IC95%, 1,44-3,37; p<0,001) incluyó a pacientes mayores con ITS grave y VD levemente dilatado pero desacoplado. El fenogrupo de riesgo alto (HR=4,67; IC95%, 3,20-6,82; p<0,001) incluyó a pacientes más jóvenes con insuficiencia tricuspídea masiva a torrencial, y el VD y la aurícula derecha gravemente dilatados y disfuncionales. El análisis multivariable confirmó que la agrupación se asoció de forma independiente con el criterio de valoración compuesto (HR=1,40; IC95%, 1,13-1,70; p=0,002). Un modelo de aprendizaje automático supervisado, desarrollado para ayudar a los médicos a asignar pacientes a los 3 fenogrupos, demostró un excelente desempeño tanto en la derivación (exactitud=0,91, precisión=0,91, recuerdo=0,91 y puntuación F1=0,91) como en la cohorte de validación (exactitud=0,80, precisión=0,78, recuerdo=0,78 y puntuación F1=0,77).
Conclusiones
El análisis de conglomerados no supervisado identificó 3 fenogrupos de riesgo, que podrían ayudar a los médicos a desarrollar estrategias de seguimiento y tratamiento más personalizadas para los pacientes con ITS.}

abstract = {Conventional cognitive assessment is widely used in clinical and research settings, in educational institutions, and in the corporate world for personnel selection. Such approaches involve having a client, a patient, or a research participant complete a series of standardized cognitive tasks in order to challenge specific and global cognitive abilities, and then quantify performance for the desired end purpose. The latter may include a diagnostic confirmation of a disease, description of a state or ability, or matching cognitive characteristics to a particular occupational role requirement. Metrics derived from cognitive assessments are putatively informative about important features of the brain and its function. For this reason, the research sector also makes use of cognitive assessments, most frequently as a stimulus for cognitive activity from which to extract functional neuroimaging data. Such “task-related activations” form the core of the most widely used neuroimaging technologies, such as fMRI. Much of what we know about the brain has been drawn from the interleaving of cognitive assessments of various types with functional brain imaging technologies. Despite innovation in neuroimaging (i.e., quantifying the neural response), relatively little innovation has occurred on task presentation and volitional response measurement; yet these together comprise the core of cognitive performance. Moreover, even when cognitive assessment is interleaved with functional neuroimaging, this is most often undertaken in the research domain, rather than the primary applications of cognitive assessment in diagnosis and monitoring, education and personnel selection. There are new ways in which brain imaging—and even more importantly, brain modulation—technologies can be combined with automation and artificial intelligence to deliver next-generation cognitive assessment methods. In this review paper, we describe some prototypes for how this can be done and identify important areas for progress (technological and otherwise) to enable it to happen. We will argue that the future of cognitive assessment will include semi- and fully-automated assessments involving neuroimaging, standardized perturbations via neuromodulation technologies, and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the fact that cognitive assessments take place in a social/interpersonal context—normally between the patient and clinician—makes the human-machine interface consequential, and this will also be discussed.}

abstract = {Purpose
Digital clothes (DCs) are an emerging product category whose commercial success will heavily depend on consumers’ perception of their economic and symbolic value. However, existing studies have overlooked the empirical assessment of consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for such products. As a result, the factors underlying consumers’ motivation to pay for them are still a matter of debate.
Design/methodology/approach
We ran three quantitative studies, including one involving participants in a real consumption context that assessed: (1) whether the perceived uniqueness of DCs increases consumers’ WTP for these products and (2) whether this effect depends on consumers’ sensation-seeking tendency (SST) and the instrumental need for touch (NFT).
Findings
We found that the higher the perceived uniqueness of DCs, the higher the consumers’ WTP for them. This effect was stronger for consumers who exhibited high SST and NFT.
Practical implications
DC developers and retailers should consider uniqueness as a key driver of DC consumption. They should target sensation seekers with high instrumental NFT who perceive DCs as unique products.
Originality/value
This research extends the understanding of the determinants of DC consumption by developing a framework that simultaneously accounts for the effects determined by a distinctive feature of these products (i.e. their uniqueness) as well as consumers’ personal characteristics.}

abstract = {Background
The use of natural language processing (NLP) in mental health research is increasing, with a wide range of applications and datasets being investigated.
Objective
This review aims to summarize the use of NLP in mental health research, with a special focus on the types of text datasets and the use of social determinants of health (SDOH) in NLP projects related to mental health.
Methods
The search was conducted in September 2024 using a broad search strategy in PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete. All citations were uploaded to Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation) software. The screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of a custom large language model (LLM) module developed by our team. This LLM module was calibrated and tuned to automate many aspects of the review process.
Results
The screening process, assisted by the custom LLM, led to the inclusion of 1768 studies in the final review. Most of the reviewed studies (n=665, 42.8%) used clinical data as their primary text dataset, followed by social media datasets (n=523, 33.7%). The United States contributed the highest number of studies (n=568, 36.6%), with depression (n=438, 28.2%) and suicide (n=240, 15.5%) being the most frequently investigated mental health issues. Traditional demographic variables, such as age (n=877, 56.5%) and gender (n=760, 49%), were commonly extracted, while SDOH factors were less frequently reported, with urban or rural status being the most used (n=19, 1.2%). Over half of the citations (n=826, 53.2%) did not provide clear information on dataset accessibility, although a sizable number of studies (n=304, 19.6%) made their datasets publicly available.
Conclusions
This scoping review underscores the significant role of clinical notes and social media in NLP-based mental health research. Despite the clear relevance of SDOH to mental health, their underutilization presents a gap in current research. This review can be a starting point for researchers looking for an overview of mental health projects using text data. Shared datasets could be used to place more emphasis on SDOH in future studies.}

Based on literature review and expert interviews/workshops, we develop a model, inspired by existing maturity models, that comprises five levels: explorer, beginner, advanced, expert and pioneer. By specifically assessing these dimensions, companies can identify their strengths and weaknesses, set strategic priorities and implement targeted measures to improve their sustainability and digitalization practices. A widespread adaptation of the framework could promote the competitiveness and resilience of companies in the age of digital transformation and contributes to the transition into a sustainable economy. Future research should focus on refining the framework based on broader application and feedback, aiming to enhance its impact and ensure its relevance in guiding companies towards the successful implementation of digital sustainability management.

In the initial two months after the release of ChatGPT, the Chinese stock market exhibited an undervaluation of GPT-focused companies, indicating information asymmetry and competitive substitution effect. With the widespread promotion of generative AI, social recognition of ChatGPT's potential value increased. This study verifies the moderation effect of social attention in strengthening ChatGPT's impact, demonstrating that a higher search index for ChatGPT enhances stock returns for GPT-focused companies. Heterogeneity tests reveal that the impact of ChatGPT is significantly positive for large or non-state-owned companies, while small or state-owned companies show no significant effect.

abstract = {Objectives
Maladaptive risky decision-making is a common pathological behavior among patients with various psychiatric disorders. Brain entropy, which measures the complexity of brain time series signals, provides a novel approach to assessing brain health. Despite its potential, the dynamics of brain entropy have seldom been explored. This study aimed to construct a dynamic model of brain entropy and examine its predictive value for risky decision-making in patients with mental disorders, utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).
Methods
This study analyzed the rs-fMRI data from a total of 198 subjects, including 48 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 47 patients with schizophrenia (SZ), 40 patients with adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as 63 healthy controls (HC). Time series signals were extracted from 264 brain regions based on rs-fMRI. The traditional static entropy and dynamic entropy (coefficient of variation, CV; rate of change, Rate) were constructed, respectively. Support vector regression was employed to predict risky decision-making utilizing leave-one-out cross-validation within each group.
Results
Our findings showed that CV achieved the best performances in HC and BD groups (r = −0.58, MAE = 6.43, R2 = 0.32; r = −0.78, MAE = 12.10, R2 = 0.61), while the Rate achieved the best in SZ and ADHD groups (r = −0.69, MAE = 10.20, R2 = 0.47; r = −0.78, MAE = 7.63, R2 = 0.60). For the dynamic entropy, the feature selection threshold rather than the time window length and overlapping ratio influenced predictive performance.
Conclusions
These results suggest that dynamic brain entropy could be a more effective predictor of risky decision-making than traditional static brain entropy. Our findings offer a novel perspective on exploring brain signal complexity and can serve as a reference for interventions targeting risky decision-making behaviors, particularly in individuals with psychiatric diagnoses.}

This study draws on an exploratory qualitative approach involving 24 international marketing professionals (with 3–30 years of experience) from Africa, Europe, the United States, and the Gulf region. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews, using purposive sampling, and continued until theoretical saturation was achieved. Data analysis is based on a thematic content analysis method. Our analysis reveals three paradoxical perceptions (favorable, unfavorable, ambivalent) and identifies a novel five-category benefit taxonomy (technological, organizational, psychological, economic, communicational) alongside six barrier categories, challenging the linear adoption models prevalent in existing literature. The results show that professionals perceive AI primarily as a complementary tool that improves their individual performance while fundamentally transforming their profession. Theoretically, this study extends TAM by incorporating professional resistance and paradoxical adoption patterns, highlighting the limitations of linear acceptance models when applied to AI adoption within creative professional contexts. The study identifies the marketing experts’ perspectives on the future of their profession, the areas with high potential for AI impact, as well as the skills needed to remain relevant in the face of increasing integration of this technology. Practically, our findings provide a framework for managing AI adoption resistance in emerging markets and guidelines for organizations navigating the AI transformation paradox.

This study aimed to compare the quality and readability of the responses generated by 3 publicly available artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (OMR) to assess their suitability for patient education.
Study Design
Fifteen OMR-related questions were selected from professional patient information websites. These questions were posed to ChatGPT-3.5 by OpenAI, Gemini 1.5 Pro by Google, and Copilot by Microsoft to generate responses. Three board-certified OMR specialists evaluated the responses regarding scientific adequacy, ease of understanding, and overall reader satisfaction. Readability was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) scores. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to compare the scores assigned by the evaluators to the responses from the chatbots and professional websites. Interevaluator agreement was examined by calculating the Fleiss kappa coefficient.
Results
There were no significant differences between groups in terms of scientific adequacy. In terms of readability, chatbots had overall mean FKGL and FRE scores of 12.97 and 34.11, respectively. Interevaluator agreement level was generally high.
Conclusions
Although chatbots are relatively good at responding to FAQs, validating AI-generated information using input from healthcare professionals can enhance patient care and safety. Readability of the text content in the chatbots and websites requires high reading levels.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the performance of four large language models (LLMs)—GPT-4, PaLM 2, Qwen, and Baichuan 2—in generating responses to inquiries from Chinese patients about dry eye disease (DED).
Design
Two-phase study, including a cross-sectional test in the first phase and a real-world clinical assessment in the second phase.
Subjects
Eight board-certified ophthalmologists and 46 patients with DED.
Methods
The chatbots' responses to Chinese patients' inquiries about DED were assessed by the evaluation. In the first phase, six senior ophthalmologists subjectively rated the chatbots’ responses using a 5-point Likert scale across five domains: correctness, completeness, readability, helpfulness, and safety. Objective readability analysis was performed using a Chinese readability analysis platform. In the second phase, 46 representative patients with DED asked the two language models (GPT-4 and Baichuan 2) that performed best in the in the first phase questions and then rated the answers for satisfaction and readability. Two senior ophthalmologists then assessed the responses across the five domains.
Main outcome measures
Subjective scores for the five domains and objective readability scores in the first phase. The patient satisfaction, readability scores, and subjective scores for the five-domains in the second phase.
Results
In the first phase, GPT-4 exhibited superior performance across the five domains (correctness: 4.47; completeness: 4.39; readability: 4.47; helpfulness: 4.49; safety: 4.47, p < 0.05). However, the readability analysis revealed that GPT-4's responses were highly complex, with an average score of 12.86 (p < 0.05) compared to scores of 10.87, 11.53, and 11.26 for Qwen, Baichuan 2, and PaLM 2, respectively. In the second phase, as shown by the scores for the five domains, both GPT-4 and Baichuan 2 were adept in answering questions posed by patients with DED. However, the completeness of Baichuan 2's responses was relatively poor (4.04 vs. 4.48 for GPT-4, p < 0.05). Nevertheless, Baichuan 2's recommendations more comprehensible than those of GPT-4 (patient readability: 3.91 vs. 4.61, p < 0.05; ophthalmologist readability: 2.67 vs. 4.33).
Conclusions
The findings underscore the potential of LLMs, particularly that of GPT-4 and Baichuan 2, in delivering accurate and comprehensive responses to questions from Chinese patients about DED.}

A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using tumor WES from the US Food and Drug Administration–led Sequencing Quality Control Phase 2 project, in which multiple library kits sequenced identical DNA materials across three laboratories to benchmark analytical validity. These workflows included various read aligner (BWA, Bowtie2, DRAGEN-Aligner, DRAGMAP, and HISAT2) and mutation caller (Mutect2, TNscope, DRAGEN-Caller, and DeepVariant) combinations. The results revealed that DRAGEN exhibited superior performance, achieving mean F1 scores of 0.966 and 0.791 for single-nucleotide variant and insertion/deletion detection, respectively. Among open-source software, BWA Mutect2 and HISAT2 Mutect2 combinations showed the highest mean F1 scores for single-nucleotide variant (0.949) and insertion/deletion (0.722), respectively. The analyses indicated that high-quality data can be analyzed as having worse results, and vice versa. Evaluations of Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer reported mutations unveiled discrepancies across enrichment kits. Integrated DNA Technologies enrichment kits showed a higher false-negative rate, whereas Agilent WES kits tended to miss mutations in CBL and IDH1, and Roche library kits tended to miss the mutations in PIK3CB. Sentieon TNscope tended to underestimate tumor mutation burden and overlook FLT3:c.G1879A for cytarabine resistance in leukemia and MAP2K1:c.G199A for BRAF inhibitors in melanoma.

Methods for spatially resolved cellular profiling of tissue sections enable in-depth study of inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity but often profile small regions, requiring evaluation of many samples to compensate for limited assessment. Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) tissue mapping offer deeper insights; however, attempts to quantify the information gained in transitioning to 3D remains limited. Here, to compare inter- and intra-sample tissue heterogeneity, we analyze >100 pancreas samples as cores, whole-slide images (WSIs), and cm3-sized 3D samples. We show that tens of WSIs and hundreds of tissue microarrays are needed to approximate the compositional tissue heterogeneity of tumors. Additionally, spatial correlations of pancreatic structures decay significantly within microns, demonstrating that isolated two-dimensional (2D) sections poorly represent their surroundings. Through 3D simulations, we determined the number of slides necessary to accurately measure tumor burden. These results quantify the power of 3D mapping and establish sampling methods for biological studies prioritizing composition or incidence.}

abstract = {Background
Synthetic dyes in industrial wastewater pose significant threats to the environment, aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Rhodamine B (RhB) is one such dye that is extensively used in the varied industries, highlighting its economic importance but also its prevalence as a pollutant. RhB has proven carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on living communities and induces numerous other ecological problems. It is therefore crucial to develop a practical and affordable technique to remove this dye from industrial wastewater. Advancements in technology have facilitated the development of photocatalysis, as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly method that indeed must be explored for the degradation of RhB.
Methods
This study introduces the synthesis of Al2O3/BiOBr composite via a facile approach. The as-synthesized composite was systematically characterized by using various structural and morphological analytical techniques. The as synthesized Al2O3/BiOBr composite was then evaluated in terms of its efficacy as photocatalyst in degrading RhB under direct sunlight.
Significant findings
The composite achieves a peak degradation efficiency of 99.6 % under direct sunlight within 160 min at optimal conditions i.e. pH 9, initial dye solution concentration of 0.010 g L−1, and a catalyst dose of 0.035 g L−1. Its recyclability was also demonstrated for five cycles. The findings position the Al2O3/BiOBr composite as a promising and effective photocatalyst, showcasing superior performance under direct sunlight irradiation. The high performance of the Al2O3/BiOBr composite was attributed to the synergism between the Al2O3 and BiOBr. The analysis revealed that Al2O3/BiOBr composite enhanced light absorption, and charge (electrons–holes) separation. The reactive radical test revealed that the ●OH, and ●O2– reactive oxygen species were dominant. The Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism for photocatalytic degradation was also deduced. Al2O3/BiOBr composite is shown to be an effective and sustainable photocatalyst and may be used for other photocatalytic-based energy and environmental applications.}

This study investigates the impact of gelator selection on the structure and three-dimensional (3D) printing performance of bigels. Formulations included a lipid-based low molecular weight gelator, glycerin monostearate (GMS), or a non-lipidic polymeric gelator, ethylcellulose (EC), in combination with thermally reversible hydrocolloids, sodium alginate (SA) or low acyl gellan gum (GG). The textural, rheological, thermal, and microstructural properties of bigels were evaluated to determine their suitability as 3D-printed adipose tissue analogs. Results demonstrated that GMS bigels formed a bicontinuous structure with higher viscosity, yield stress, and mechanical strength, whereas EC-based bigels exhibited a W/O structure with lower rigidity. GMS bigels effectively replicate the thermal softening of adipose tissue, closely mimicking its behavior under varying temperature conditions. Additionally, GMS bigels with smaller particle sizes demonstrated enhanced long-term structural stability. SA exhibited better printing performance than GG by enhancing self-supporting ability and shape retention after extrusion. GMS-SA resulted in the most structurally stable and printable bigels, characterized by smooth surfaces, strong appearance, and excellent extrusion fidelity. In contrast, EC-based bigels, while printable, demonstrated inferior mechanical properties and weaker structural integrity. These findings highlight the critical role of gelator selection in defining the functional properties of bigels, particularly in optimizing their performance as 3D-printable adipose tissue analogs. This study provides new insights into the formulation of plant-based fat analogs, contributing to the advancement of sustainable meat alternatives.}

Canada’s 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s findings concerning child welfare highlighted impacts resulting in Indigenous people’s dispossession, trauma, separation, and relational upheavals through forced removals and lasting harm to children, families and communities. Canadian Provincial government legislation over child welfare authority dominates and these outcomes continue today through child apprehensions. In 2020 the Canadian Federal Government enacted Bill C-92 respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families; a legal framework intended to reduce the gross over-representation of Indigenous children in care. It affirms the inherent jurisdictional authority of Indigenous communities over their child and family matters. In 2024 following some Provincial Governments’ legal challenges, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously confirmed C-92 is constitutional in its entirety. This article chronicles the efforts of a team of Indigenous Dene, provincially-delegated workers with extensive experience working within provincial child and family legislative frameworks. Within 15-months 47 children taken by Alberta Children’s Services from their rural community were returned and re-connected to their families, kin and culture. Culturally-based practices such as inclusion of ceremonial practices, using circle processes to conduct meetings and problem solve and respecting the traditional authority of matriarchs within the Indigenous Dene kinship system were key strategies in resisting and challenging the status quo of provincial child welfare authorities. These actions can encourage other communities to transform current child welfare approaches by restoring and reclaiming their own laws and traditional practices which offer alternative, humane and culturally-connected ways to protect children, support healing and rebuild communities.}

Based on the perspective of corporate governance costs, we discuss the influence and function mechanism of artificial intelligence on corporate tax avoidance. The results show that artificial intelligence can promote tax avoidance for enterprises by increasing high-skilled labor cost and intelligent input cost. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that artificial intelligence exerts a more influence on corporate tax avoidance in circumstances where tax regulatory intensity is diminished, and the tax burden is escalated. This study enriches the research on the development of enterprise intelligence in the new era, opens the "black box" between artificial intelligence and tax avoidance, and provides evidence for the logic between them.}

Our approach involves the utilization of a multi-modal agent framework to elevate the expression of factual content and applies a textual reasoning architecture for the purpose of expressive story generation and prediction. Furthermore, we introduce the Story-Adapter module, tailored for long image sequence illustration, with a focus on maintaining prolonged story consistency as opposed to short-term object consistency. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the superior performance of the proposed LLaMS with human evaluation. Evaluations demonstrate that LLaMS achieves state-of-the-art storytelling performance, with an 86% correlation and 100% consistency win rate compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we conduct ablation experiments to confirm the efficacy of the proposed multi-modal agent framework and Story-Adapter module.

abstract = {Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use may be associated with diverse cardiovascular (CV) adverse events (AEs), but their baseline prevalence and incidence after ICI initiation are poorly known. We aimed to describe CV events using real-world hospital data from Belgian cancer patients.
Materials and methods
Electronic health records (EHRs) from patients receiving at least one ICI between March 2017 and August 2022 at three Belgian hospitals were processed into an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model warehouse. Structured data were enriched with unstructured data that were processed using a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline. We analyzed CV events from first ICI administration until last follow-up, identifying and validating the first detection of a CV event at the patient level.
Results
We included 1571 patients (66% male, median age 67 years); CV events were detected in 196 (12.5%) patients [median (min-max) follow-up: 8 (0-63) months]. The CV AEs detected were heart failure (5.3%), atrial fibrillation (4.6%), myocardial infarction (2.0%), atrioventricular block (1.9%), myocarditis (1.2%), vasculitis (0.8%), pericarditis (0.4%), and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (<0.3%). Median time (min-max) to onset ranged from 109 days (17-849 days) for myocarditis to 529 days (91-967 days) for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study using a dataset enriched with NLP-processed EHRs that describes the frequency and onset time of CV events. CV event frequencies were higher than those reported in clinical trials, but similar to other real-world studies. However, we observed a later time to onset. Hence, clinicians should note that CV AEs can present in various ways and at any time during or after treatment.}

Past research has shown an inverse correlation between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and coronary heart disease (CHD), while recent studies have shown that extremely high or low HDL levels increase the risk of cardiovascular death.
OBJECTIVE
To explore the relationships between HDL subtypes and the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS
This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Ultimately, we included 1,200 adult participants with AMI hospitalized from 2017 to 2023. Patients were classified into mild and moderate-severe groups according to their Gensini score. Restricted cubic spline and multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between HDL subclasses and the severity of coronary stenosis.
RESULTS
The adjusted odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values for HDL subclasses in the multivariate logistic model (adjusted for age, gender, hypertension status, diabetes status, stroke status, and kidney disease status) were as follows: HDL-2b: 0.97 (0.95–1.00, p= 0.018) and HDL-3: 0.98 (0.97–0.99, p= 0.008). Subgroup analysis revealed that HDL-3 exhibited a statistically significant impact on the severity of coronary stenosis among individuals <75 years of age and among men, and the influence of HDL-2b on the severity of coronary stenosis was statistically significant only in individuals aged ≥75 years.
Conclusion
The relationship between reduced levels of HDL-2b and HDL-3 and the risk of coronary stenosis exhibited a linear pattern and was significantly modified by age. Subgroup analysis identified specific populations that warrant attention regarding HDL-2b and HDL-3.}

abstract = {Objectives
Cervical lymphadenopathy can indicate various benign or malignant conditions. While ultrasound-guided core biopsy is commonly used for diagnosis, its effectiveness can vary. Our study aimed to determine factors that affect the diagnostic yield of this procedure, potentially guiding appropriate patient referrals toward either more invasive diagnostic procedures, such as open biopsy, or less intensive approaches like ongoing follow up.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted evaluating ultrasound-guided core biopsies performed for cervical lymphadenopathy at a single institution. Imaging features and technical details were documented. Two radiologists collected data from formal procedure reports and recorded sonographic images. Data were then correlated with histopathologic reports.
Results
The study included 136 patients with final diagnoses of lymphoproliferative disease (95 patients, 69.8%), reactive lymphadenopathy (24 cases, 17.6%) and carcinoma (17 patients, 12.5%). Twenty-four of the initial biopsies were nondiagnostic (17.6%), requiring diagnosis through surgery, follow-up, or repeated biopsy. Of the 24 nondiagnostic biopsies, 17 were eventually identified as reactive lymph nodes, and 7 harbored lymphoproliferative disease. All carcinoma cases were detected on the initial biopsy. Larger lymph node size correlated with higher diagnostic yield (p<0.01). No correlation was found with needle gauge (p=0.13), proximity to large vessels (p=0.68), or overshoot potential (p=0.26).
Conclusion
Our study results showed that smaller lymph node size and presence of a fatty hilum are correlated with reduced diagnostic yield. Patients with unfavorable characteristics should be considered for imaging surveillance, fine needle aspiration (FNA) or an open biopsy.}

Exploring the relationship between the Scratch project and its remix would provide a new perspective for understanding users’ creative behaviors. To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed. This study has important implications for understanding the creative level of remix among users in programming community and guiding users to make valuable remixes.}

However, despite the proliferation of AI-powered biomarkers, significant hurdles still remain in translating them to the clinic and driving adoption, including lack of population diversity, difficulties accessing harmonised data, costly and time-consuming clinical studies, evolving AI regulatory frameworks and absence of scalable diagnostic infrastructure. Here, we provide an overview of the AI toolkit available for biomarker discovery, and we discuss exciting examples of AI-powered biomarkers across therapeutic areas. Finally, we address the challenges ahead of us to ensure that these technologies reach patients and users globally and unlock a new era of fast innovation for precision medicine.}

Until the introduction of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) in March 2023, these LLMs only contained a single mode—text. As medicine is a multimodal discipline, the potential future versions of LLMs that can handle multimodality—meaning that they could interpret and generate not only text but also images, videos, sound, and even comprehensive documents—can be conceptualized as a significant evolution in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper zooms in on the new potential of generative AI, a new form of AI that also includes tools such as LLMs, through the achievement of multimodal inputs of text, images, and speech on health care’s future. We present several futuristic scenarios to illustrate the potential path forward as multimodal LLMs (M-LLMs) could represent the gateway between health care professionals and using AI for medical purposes. It is important to point out, though, that despite the unprecedented potential of generative AI in the form of M-LLMs, the human touch in medicine remains irreplaceable. AI should be seen as a tool that can augment health care professionals rather than replace them. It is also important to consider the human aspects of health care—empathy, understanding, and the doctor-patient relationship—when deploying AI.}

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks show great attraction due to their characteristics of global coverage and low latency. Traditional terrestrial routing methods face significant challenges in adapting to LEO satellite networks due to challenges such as highly dynamic topologies, resource constraints, and insufficient multi-objective optimization capabilities. Therefore, developing routing methods suitable for LEO satellite application scenarios is crucial for further improving network transmission performance and is also one of the key technologies of future 6G. Compared with traditional algorithms, routing algorithms based on machine learning (ML) are more intelligent and begin to show obvious performance advantages, and are more suitable for 6G networks. However, in existing research work, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis content on integrating ML into LEO satellite network routing tasks. We comprehensively summarize the latest progress of intelligent routing algorithms based on ML in LEO satellite networks from four aspects: routing models, design challenges, training and deployment, and future research directions. The aim is to provide theoretical support for the design of artificial intelligence satellite communication systems and further promote the innovative development of satellite network optimization technologies.}

This task is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D datasets for Chinese paintings and the limited research on their 3D reconstruction. As a result, direct access to multiple views is precluded. We propose a novel method for the 3D reconstruction of Traditional Chinese Painting Elements, termed TCPE-3D, which has three components of the process. The first component is a multi-view synthesis module named One To Six (OTX) - Multi-View Generating (MVG) Module. This module creates six fixed-view images through a series of preprocessing steps. These images are used to generate the Local Light Field Fusion (LLFF) dataset within the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) synthesis module. This process leads to the creation of detailed mesh structures in the final Mesh Generation module. Comparison with several state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods shows that our framework achieves better visualization results and higher technical specifications. Additionally, it solves the Janus problem encountered by other algorithms for Chinese painting data. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/LPDLG/3DTCP-Dataset.}

An essential component of lifecycle management for achieving sustainability is reliability-centered maintenance, which enhances various key performance indicators (KPIs), including machine availability and environmental impact. Effective and reliable maintenance necessitates expert knowledge of the equipment. For instance, determining which components and failure modes should be addressed through condition-based maintenance requires insights derived from failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). However, constructing expert knowledge is labor-intensive, and ensuring its quality presents significant challenges. This study proposes a method for the automated construction of expert knowledge related to maintenance, along with a corresponding tool designed to reduce construction costs and enhance knowledge quality. The proposed method leverages a large language model (LLM) to automatically generate asset knowledge graphs based on FMEA. By combining general knowledge about equipment derived from the pre-trained LLM with specialized information extracted from technical documents, the tool creates knowledge structures such as component trees and failure modes. Subject matter experts can then iteratively refine and validate this knowledge. To evaluate the proposed approach, we assessed the accuracy and coverage of the knowledge generated by the tool in two case studies involving specific types of equipment. The results indicated that the LLM-generated output contained 4.98 times more items than those manually created, with precision ranging from 0.490 to 0.662 and recall ranging from 0.481 to 0.810.}

abstract = {Background
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) infection or exposure associated with soft tissue deficiency represents a challenging scenario for the reconstructive surgeon. The aim of the study is to determine the most successful reconstructive option for infected or exposed TKA comparing local muscle flaps (LMF), local fasciocutaneous flaps (LFF), and free muscle flaps (FMF).
Methods
A systematic review and single-arm network meta-analysis (PRISMA) was conducted to compare outcomes of complicated TKA requiring soft tissue coverage with either LMF, LFF and FMF. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023388731). PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were queried. MINORS criteria were employed for bias assessment. Outcomes included infection recurrence, TKA failure, above-knee amputation, and arthrodesis.
Results
A total of 30 studies and 555 flaps were included. Pooled prevalence was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11–0.26) for infection recurrence, 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11–0.28) for arthroplasty failure, 0.10 (95% CI: 0.08–0.13) for above-knee amputation and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.08–0.13) for arthrodesis. Local fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated the lowest risk of infection recurrence (LFF = 0.04 ± 0.037, LMF = 0.27 ± 0.043, FMF = 0.26 ± 0.092), arthroplasty failure (LFF = 0.11 ± 0.068, LMF = 0.28 ± 0.045, FMF = 0.22 ± 0.094) and knee arthrodesis (LFF = 0.03 ± 0.027, LMF = 0.14 ± 0.03, FMF = 0.08 ± 0.06) after flap coverage of infected TKA. Free muscle flaps were associated with the lowest risk of above knee amputation (FMF = 0.08 ± 0.07, LFF = 0.10 ± 0.07, LMF = 0.11 ± 0.03). The mean MINORS score was 11.1 (95% CI: 11–12) with major weakness being the lack of prospective enrollment of the patients.
Conclusion
Based on the available literature, when appropriate, LFF appear to be the best reconstructive choice for soft tissue reconstruction in complicated TKA.}

Specifically, the rapid growth in the use of imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT) and X-rays has outpaced the capabilities of conventional retrieval systems, necessitating more sophisticated approaches to assist in clinical decision-making and research. Our study introduces a novel deep hash coding-based Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) framework that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with hash coding for efficient and accurate retrieval. The model integrates a Dense block-based feature learning network, a hash learning block, and a spatial attention block to enhance feature extraction specific to medical imaging. We reduce dimensionality by applying the Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) algorithm while preserving diagnostic information. The framework achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.85 on ChestX-ray8, 0.82 on TCIA-CT, 0.84 on MIMIC-CXR, and 0.82 on LIDC-IDRI datasets, with retrieval times of 675 ms, 663 ms, 735 ms, and 748 ms, respectively. Comparisons with ResNet and DenseNet confirm the effectiveness of our model, enhancing medical image retrieval significantly for clinical decision-making and research.}

To translate, cross-culturally adapt and study the psychometric properties of the Wisconsin Running Injury and Recovery Index (UWRI) in Italian runners with running-related injuries (RRI).
Design
clinometric study.
Setting
5 private outpatient physical therapy clinics.
Participants
144 subjects with RRI.
Main outcome measures
UWRI translation was performed following international guidelines. Structural validity (confirmatory factor analysis [CFA]), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha [α]), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), measurement error (minimal detectable change [MDC]), and construct validity (hypothesis testing).
Results
UWRI translation was performed without issues. CFA showed a two-factor structure (i.e., running progression and symptom surveillance subscale) (comparative fit index = 0.988; Tucker–Lewis index = 0.977; root mean square error of approximation = 0.049; standardized root mean square residual = 0.042). Each subscale presented high internal consistency (α = 0.92 and 0.75 for the running progression and symptom surveillance subscales, respectively), excellent and good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.99 and 0.89 for the running progression and symptom surveillance subscales, respectively), and acceptable measurement error (MDC = 0.33 and 2.3 points for the running progression and symptom surveillance subscales, respectively). Construct validity was moderate for both subscales as 50.0 % (2/4) of a-priori hypotheses were satisfied.
Conclusion
The validation process revealed acceptable psychometric properties of the UWRI Italian version, which can be used for research and clinical purposes.}

Identifying Deepfake videos is one step towards fighting their malicious uses. While the previous works introduced accurate methods for Deepfake detection, the stability of the proposed methods is rarely discussed. The problem statement of this paper is to build a stable model for Deepfake detection. The results of the model should be reproducible. In other words, if other researchers repeat the same experiments, the results should not differ. The proposed technique combines multiple spatiotemporal textures and deep learning-based features. An enhanced 3D Convolutional Neural Network, which contains a spatiotemporal attention layer, is utilized in a Siamese architecture. Various analyses are carried out on the control parameters, feature importance, and reproducibility of results. Our technique is tested on four datasets: Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, DeepfakeTIMIT, and FaceShifter. The results demonstrate that a Siamese architecture can improve the accuracy of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks by 7.9 % and reduce the standard deviation of accuracy to 0.016, which indicates reproducible results. Furthermore, adding texture features enhances accuracy by up to 91.96 %. The final model can achieve an Area Under Curve (AUC) up to 97.51 % and 95.44 % in same-dataset and cross-dataset scenarios, respectively. The main contributions of this work are the enhancement of model stability and the assurance of result repeatability, ensuring consistent results with high accuracy.}
