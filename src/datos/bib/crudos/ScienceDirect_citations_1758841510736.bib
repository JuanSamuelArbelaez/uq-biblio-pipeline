abstract = {Background
Morton’s interdigital neuroma, caused by compression of the interdigital nerve, often requires surgery when conservative treatment fail. This study compared open neurectomy and percutaneous intermetatarsal ligament release (PILR), focusing on various predictive factors.
Methods
A retrospective study, comprising 46 patients (58 feet) with Morton’s neuroma who underwent either open excision (n = 24) or PILR (n = 22) from 2012 to 2022. Data included demographics, MRI-measured neuroma size, complications, and revision surgery. Outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), and satisfaction scores.
Results
Open excision yielded better outcomes than PILR for neuromas larger than 7.40 mm, with lower VAS scores (2.3 vs. 3.9), higher FAAM scores (87 vs. 72), and greater satisfaction (3.2 vs. 2.1). Neuroma width predicted outcomes in the PILR group.
Conclusion
Open excision is superior for larger neuromas, while PILR may suit smaller ones (<7.40 mm).
Level of evidence
Level III cohort study
Clinical relevance
This study highlights the importance of neuroma width in determining the success of percutaneous intermetatarsal ligament release (PILR). Our findings suggest that PILR may be more appropriate for smaller neuromas (<7.40 mm), while open excision offers better outcomes for larger neuromas. This insight could guide surgeons in selecting the most suitable surgical approach, optimizing patient outcomes, and minimizing complications.}

abstract = {Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with treatment strategies primarily including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Although immunotherapies targeting T and natural killer cells are widely used, the development of therapies focusing on neutrophils has been lacking. Neutrophils were regarded as a specialized cell population that, once matured, lacked the capacity for proliferation and were rapidly depleted in circulation, limiting their role to immune defense. However, recent discoveries have revealed that neutrophils represent a highly heterogeneous immune cell population, across diverse microenvironments. They are referred to as tumor-associated neutrophils when recruited to the tumor microenvironment. Initially, tumor-associated neutrophils were believed to primarily promote tumor growth and metastasis. Contrarily, emerging evidence indicates that tumor-associated neutrophils exhibit anti-tumor functions under specific conditions, acting as inhibitors during the initial growth or metastatic phases of lung cancer. This functional heterogeneity positions neutrophils as a promising focus for novel approaches to lung cancer immunotherapy. This review aims to explore the role of tumor-associated neutrophils in lung cancer progression and to investigate responses in the context of tumor control, thereby deepening the understanding of neutrophil function in lung cancer.}

To explore the ability of artificial intelligence to produce comparison tables to facilitate shared decision-making.
Methods
An expert human-generated comparison table (Option Grid ™) was compared to four comparison tables produced by large language models and one produced using a Google search process that a patient might undertake. Each table was prepared for a patient with osteoarthritis of the knee, considering a knee replacement. The results were compared to the Option Grid.™ The information items in each comparison table were divided into eight categories: the intervention process; benefits; side effects & adverse effects; pre-operative care; post-operative care & physical recovery; repeat surgery; decision-making process; and alternative interventions. We assessed the accuracy of each information item in a binary manner (accurate, inaccurate).
Results
OpenBioLLM-70b and two proprietary ChatGPT models generated similar frequencies of information items across most categories, but omitted information on alternative interventions. The Google search process yielded the highest number of information items (n = 41), and OpenBioLLM-8b yielded the lowest (n = 20). Accuracy, compared to the human Option Grid, was 97 % for the ChatGPT models and the open-source OpenBioLLM-70b, and 95 % for OpenBioLLM-8b and the Google search process. The human-generated Option Grid had superior readability.
Conclusions
Large language models produced comparison tables that are 3–5 % less accurate than a human generated Option Grid. Comparison tables produced by large language models may be less readable and require additional checking and editing.
Practice implications
Subject to fact-checking and feedback, large language models may have a role to play in scaling up the production of evidence-based comparison tables that could assist patients and others.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The nutritional needs of preterm newborns (PTNB) are increased and enhancing nutritional management is essential to meet them. The addition of multicomponent additive (MA) to human milk (HM) is used as a treatment strategy. The objective of the research is to analyze the association between the use of MA added to HM with nutritional and clinical outcomes in low-birth weight PTNB admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods
Prospective cohort study with PTNB weighing less than 2500 g during hospitalization in the NICU, who were divided into two distinct groups based on the presence or absence of MA supplementation. We investigated outcomes related to nutritional status at discharge, length of stay, presence of metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP), extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) and encouragement of breastfeeding at discharge.
Results
A total of 65 PTNB were included. We found that the lower the BW, the more often the use of MA was observed (p = 0.006). At discharge, there was a decline in z- scores, in which 46 % of PTNB who used MA developed malnutrition. The length of stay was longer in the group of PTNB who used MA (p < 0.001). The percentage of PTNB with MBDP who used MA (52.5 %) was higher than the percentage of those who did not use it (p = 0.006). The probability of PTNB with MBDP using MA is 2.65 times higher than those without MDBP.
Conclusion
The use of MA to HM did not prevent or avoid the decline in nutritional status of the PTNBs, considering that those who used it had greater difficulty gaining weight, longer hospital stays, and more MBPD diagnoses compared to the group that did not use supplementation. However, the MA was crucial as it provided essential nutritional support for those PTNB who are more susceptible to MBDP.}

abstract = {In optimizing the performance and extending the lifespan of lithium batteries, accurate state prediction is crucial. Traditional regression and classification methods have achieved some success in predicting battery states. However, the effectiveness of these data-driven approaches largely depends on the availability and quality of public datasets. Additionally, generating electrochemical data primarily through battery experiments is a lengthy and costly process, making it extremely difficult to obtain high-quality data. This difficulty, combined with data incompleteness, significantly affects prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this study introduces End of Life (EOL) and Equivalent Cycle Life (ECL) as supervised conditions for generative AI models. By integrating an embedding layer into the CVAE model, we developed the Refined Conditional Variational Autoencoder (RCVAE). Through preprocessing data into a quasi-video format, coupled with customized training and inference algorithms, the RCVAE generates the required charging data in real time based on the battery’s ECL and EOL. This avoids storing irrelevant information, saving space and resources. RCVAE uses a lightweight architecture, enabling fast generation of necessary voltage, current, temperature, and charging capacity data. This approach provides users with a comprehensive electrochemical dataset, pioneering a new research domain for the artificial synthesis of lithium battery data. Furthermore, based on the detailed synthetic data, various battery state indicators can be calculated, offering new perspectives and possibilities for lithium battery performance prediction.}

abstract = {Background
ChatGPT is a natural language processing chatbot with a significant prevalence in modern media with a clear application in the medical triage workflow. ChatGPT has shown significant capacity for understanding clinical vignettes, radiology reports, and even passing the American Board of Neurological Surgery board examination. There has never been an evaluation of the chatbot in triage and diagnosing spinal vignettes common to primary and urgent care practice.
Methods
Fifteen clinical scenarios were created to mimic spinal complaints common to primary and urgent care scenarios. GPT-4 was instructed to assess the situation as if it was in a primary care office and determine diagnosis, imaging recommendations, and if emergency room (ER) or operative referral was necessary. Answers were recorded and the results compared to those of attending and resident respondents.
Results
GPT-4 provided the most likely diagnosis in each scenario. Additionally, it recommended reasonable clinical management of each scenario which would fall within standard practice guidelines. ChatGPT tended toward over-referral to the ER; however, this was not significant. GPT-4 was noninferior in all categories when compared to respondents.
Conclusions
ChatGPT is a powerful tool for primary triage of spinal issues. It can rapidly and accurately evaluate clinical scenarios and provide clear diagnostic reasoning. GPT-4 is not designed for medical use and will provide a disclaimer as such. It did tend toward over-referring patients to the ER. With specific training, it is likely that artificial intelligence and natural language processing chatbots will become widely used in primary triage of spinal issues.}

abstract = {Background
YouTube is an accessible online resource for education-related information. An “intitle:” search modifier uses specific terms to aid in limiting or expanding results. There is limited knowledge on the impact of search modifiers on quality and accuracy of OB/GYN educational instructional videos.
Objective
Our objective is to examine the effect of “intitle:” search modifier on the quality and accuracy of YouTube OB/GYN educational videos.
Study Design
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology(ACOG) /The Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) endorsed the Surgical Curriculum of Obstetrics and Gynecology (SCOG) procedures. This approved procedure list in combination with the search modifier, “intitle:” was used in YouTube search queries. Results were screened with strict exclusion criteria and video characteristics were obtained. Videos were graded on accuracy and quality using a SCOG accuracy checklist and the validated Laparoscopic Surgery Video Educational Guidelines (LAP-VEGaS) video assessment tool. Results were analyzed using ANOVA statistical testing.
Results
A total of 353 videos were screened, 89 were excluded and 264 were analyzed. For videos without asearch modifier, international organizations had highest % accuracy and only international healthcare organization videos met a quality score of 11.2. After using a search modifier, average accuracy and quality scores increased by 33.2% and 38.1%, respectively. Videos with quality scores > 11 included multiple types of organizations (Table 6). The “intitle:” search modifier videos had statistically significant improvement in quality and accuracy separated by likes, views and affiliated organizations (p-value < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in accuracy and quality for the search modifier videos based on the number of subscribers and geographic location.
Conclusion
The user-friendly nature of YouTube allows OB/GYN providers the ability to access and learn from educational videos. Understanding characteristics associated with accurate and quality information ensures proper selection of precise and current educational resources. It is imperative that providers are aware of the importance and enhancement of “intitle:” search modifier when searching for OB/GYN educational content.}

It explores how GAI affects both senders’ ability to create salient messages and receivers’ costs of absorbing them. The analysis reveals that while GAI can increase communication by reducing costs, it may also disrupt traditional signalling mechanisms. In a salience model, GAI generally improves outcomes but can potentially reduce receiver welfare. In a pure signalling model, GAI may hinder effective communication by making it harder to distinguish high-quality messages. This suggests that GAI’s introduction necessitates new instruments and mechanisms to facilitate effective communication and quality assessment in this evolving landscape.}

However, its potential benefits come with compelling ethical and legal risks, necessitating proper guardrails steering AI in beneficial directions. Amid the global race to AI regulation, China has exhibited strong and open ambition in shaping the emerging global AI order. In response to challenges posed by AI, China has not only implemented agile administrative intervention in policy support, central coordination, and investment, but also adopted an AI governance framework that characterized by ‘complexity,’ ‘agility,’ ‘stability,’ and ‘flexibility.’ Nevertheless, while an agile, sector-specific approach to AI governance may yield short-term benefits, it raises long-term concerns, including opaque decision-making, weak enforcement, fragmented oversight, and inadequate protection of fundamental rights. In particular, governance fragmentation marked by overlapping regulatory bodies and layered rulemaking risks producing piecemeal and outdated regulations that struggle to keep pace with rapid technological change. Current interventions often prioritize systemic stability over ethical clarity and robust supervision, while strategic ambiguity further complicates the implementation of AI ethics and hinders effective oversight, whether internal or administrative. Instead of calling for an omnibus AI law that applies a uniform package of rules, Chinese regulators chose to adapt horizontal elements into vertical regulations through a set of bureaucratic know-how and iterative regulatory tools. Through a comparative legal analysis, this paper finds that comprehending the intricacies of China’s AI regulatory approach is vital not only for projecting its future technological progression but also for understanding its impact on international tech competition. Differences in diverse AI governance may offer valuable insights while commonalities in AI governance values and principles hold promises for global cooperation in responsible AI governance. Moreover, it is plausible to expect that China will reconcile existing horizontal regulatory tools in a horizontal legislative package, while the EU AI Act provides valuable practical implications for the transition from vertical AI-related regulations to a horizontal Chinese AI Law, and the decentralized regulatory approach adopted by the U.S. serves as a useful reference for multi-stakeholder and multi-level cooperation. In addition, EU’s rights-driven framework and US’s market-driven model may serve as critical benchmarks, influencing China’s state-driven approach to harmonizing its legislative strategies for a responsive AI regulation.}

The goal was to reduce the workload while also maintaining the transparency and objectivity of the selection process. The algorithms were trained, validated, and tested on a set of 3187 studies on simulation-based learning found in medical and educational databases collected before April 2018. Subsequently, they were utilized to classify abstracts for a follow-up meta-analysis consisting of 2373 studies (published between 2018 and 2020). The aim of training the algorithms was to predict studies’ abstract eligibility based on words and combinations of words used in these abstracts. The application of the algorithms reduced the number of studies that had to be manually screened from 2373 to 711. A total of 458 studies from automatically selected abstracts were included in the full-text screening, indicating the high precision of the algorithms (also compared to the performance of human raters).

To address these issues, we proposed the AE-COT-GAN model (Autoencoder-based Conditional Optimal Transport Generative Adversarial Network) for the generation of medical images belonging to specific categories. The training process of our model comprises three fundamental components. The training process of our model encompasses three fundamental components. First, we employ an autoencoder model to obtain a low-dimensional manifold representation of real images. Second, we apply extended semi-discrete optimal transport to map Gaussian noise distribution to the latent space distribution and obtain corresponding labels effectively. This procedure leads to the generation of new latent codes with known labels. Finally, we integrate a GAN to train the decoder further to generate medical images. To evaluate the performance of the AE-COT-GAN model, we conducted experiments on two medical image datasets, namely DermaMNIST and BloodMNIST. The model’s performance was compared with state-of-the-art generative models. Results show that the AE-COT-GAN model had excellent performance in generating medical images. Moreover, it effectively addressed the common issues associated with traditional GANs.}

abstract = {Background
Gait speed indicates the onset or decline of physical performance in sarcopenia. However, real-time measurements of other gait parameters, such as step length, stride length, step width, and support time, are limited. The advent of wearable technology has facilitated the measurement of these parameters, necessitating further investigation into their potential applications.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between gait parameters measured using wearable sensors and muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in community-dwelling older adults.
Methods
In a cross-sectional study of 91 participants aged ≥65 years, gait parameters, such as step count, step length, cadence, single and double support times, vertical oscillation, and instantaneous vertical loading rate (IVLR), measured using a wireless earbud device, were analyzed on the basis of the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), calf circumference, handgrip strength, 5-time chair stand test, short physical performance battery (SPPB), and the SARC-F (strength, assistance with walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs and fall frequency) questionnaire. This study was conducted from July 10 to November 1, 2023, at an outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Seoul, Korea. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate independent associations after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities.
Results
Among 91 participants (45 men and 46 women; mean age 74.1 years for men and 73.6 years for women), gait speed and vertical oscillation showed negative associations with their performance in the 5-time chair stand test (P<.001) and SARC-F and positive associations with their performance in the SPPB (P<.001). Vertical oscillations were also associated with grip strength (P=.003). Single and double support times were associated with performance in the 5-time chair stand test and SPPB (P<.001). In addition, double support time was associated with SARC-F scores (P<.001). Gait speed, support time, vertical oscillation, and IVLR showed independent associations with performance in the 5-time chair stand test and SPPB (P<.001), both related to muscle strength or physical performance. Gait speed, double support time, and vertical oscillation all had significant associations with SARC-F scores.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated a significant association between gait monitoring using wearable sensors and quantitative assessments of muscle strength and physical performance in older people. Furthermore, this study substantiated the extensive applicability of diverse gait parameters in predicting sarcopenia.}

abstract = {Introduction: In an era where technological advancements in large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms like ChatGPT continually redefine the boundaries of medicine, the advent of Amazon Web Services (AWS) HealthScribe on July 26th, 2023, heralds a transformative moment in healthcare. This HIPAA-eligible generative AI service, capable of transcribing patient-provider conversations and automatically entering them into an electronic health record (EHR) system, represents a profound intersection of technology and medical practice. As this technology permeates clinical settings, addressing associated patient concerns with AI becomes paramount. Although providers may grasp the intricacies of such technology swiftly, patients are likely to harbor concerns. Patients may be unfamiliar with the technology or question its safety. Clear and precise communication will be essential for physicians to ease patient concerns. Our team interviewed forty-eight subjects to survey their understanding, concerns, and opinions on artificial intelligence. We then classified and visually charted their responses. Based on our data, we created a framework for ethical communication physicians can follow when talking to patients about using artificial intelligence in clinical settings. Method: A multidisciplinary team encompassing physicians, advanced practice providers specializing in hematology and oncology, and bioethicists engaged with forty-eight subjects. The study population represented a diverse cross-section of society, differing in aspects such as age, sex assigned at birth, political orientation, education, income, ethnicity, occupation, and religious affiliation. Our investigative process included a structured interview containing twenty-five foundational questions. No personal health information was collected during the questionnaire, and all questions sought only to garner subject opinion. Questions were designed to probe areas of interest such as: (1) the subject's general feelings about AI in healthcare, (2) their familiarity with AI technologies, (3) the existence of any specific concerns, and (4) a deeper exploration of those concerns. The responses were meticulously collected, categorized, and analyzed to discern emergent trends. Results: Our team developed The TRUST Framework based on our research findings by identifying and addressing the three primary concerns with AI in healthcare; transparency, confidentiality, and consent. The data presented a mosaic of varied opinions, with minimal discernible trends correlating with specific demographic attributes. One of the subtle patterns identified pertained to age. Subjects within the 12-35 age bracket demonstrated a familiarity with artificial intelligence, generally expressing indifference rather than concern or enthusiasm. Those aged 35-65 exhibited greater pronounced indifference than any age demographic and revealed an unfamiliarity with existing artificial intelligence tools. Conversely, respondents aged 65 and older expressed the highest level of concern and a prevalent unfamiliarity with the range of available artificial intelligence applications. Conclusion: Effective communication when introducing the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare settings is imperative. This conclusion is based on abstract reasoning and rooted in real-world feedback received from a diverse subject population. Our research revealed that subjects have varying feelings and concerns with artificial intelligence, irrespective of their background. Therefore, avoiding unconscious bias and having a framework for communicating how AI will be used is essential. As the frontier of AI continues to expand, the need for ethical and transparent communication will only grow. This study serves as a call to action for healthcare providers to commit to clear, honest, and empathetic communication about AI's role in patient care. Doing so will promote the overall acceptance of AI in healthcare, subsequently enhancing patient outcomes and alleviating patient concerns by building trust.}

And refrigerant is widely employed in low and medium grade energy utilization and heating ventilation and air conditioning. The refrigerant mixtures can effectively combine the advantages of their components, which plays a key role in decarbonization. As a basic thermophysical property, critical temperature, Tc, plays an important role in thermodynamic calculation and thermodynamics system design. In this work, the structure-property relationship models of Tc for binary refrigerants were established by developing predictive models based on 61 binary refrigerants with 275 sets of experimental Tc data and six machine learning algorithms. Also, specific halogenated groups of refrigerants are used to characterize the components and molecular structures of binary mixtures. The Multiple-layer Perceptron model owns the best fitting and generalization ability with the average deviation is lower than 2 ​%. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed model does not rely on any experimental property data or empirical parameters, and can accurately predict Tc of binary refrigerant mixtures directly from their components and mixing ratios. The present work could be guided in building predictive models for other properties, thereby supporting the development of novel refrigerant mixtures.}

One widely adopted intervention by platforms for addressing falsehoods is applying “warning labels” to posts deemed inaccurate by fact-checkers. Despite a rich literature on correcting misinformation after exposure, much less work has examined the effectiveness of warning labels presented concurrent with exposure. Promisingly, existing research suggests that warning labels effectively reduce belief and spread of misinformation. The size of these beneficial effects depends on how the labels are implemented and the characteristics of the content being labeled. Despite some individual differences, recent evidence indicates that warning labels are generally effective across party lines and other demographic characteristics. We discuss potential implications and limitations of labeling policies for addressing online misinformation.}

Oligo(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether) resins are commonly used owing to their low dielectric constant and high thermal resistance; however, further reduction in dielectric loss tangents is needed for future communication networks. Materials with excellent dielectric properties typically exhibit low polarity and high flammability, presenting a trade-off between dielectric performance and flame retardancy. PMPS-V exhibits thermosetting behavior and an extremely low dielectric-loss tangent (<0.001 at 10 GHz). Owing to its polyphenylene sulfide backbone, PMPS-V meets the UL-94 V-0 flame retardancy standard. Long-term heat resistance testing at 150 °C confirmed minimal degradation in dielectric properties, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. In addition, PMPS-V has a high glass transition temperature and favorable solubility in common solvents such as toluene, making it suitable for printed wiring board applications. These results indicate that PMPS-V is a promising candidate for next-generation low dielectric materials.}

Her brain MRI was significant for type 1 lissencephaly without other radiographical features of cCMV. The patient initially responded to high dose Prednisolone but had relapse of spasms at 9-month-old and required an ACTH course. She later developed generalized tonic seizures and focal impaired awareness seizures. Subsequent whole exome sequencing (WES) trio revealed a de novo PAFAH1B1 (c.405G > A, p.W135*) heterozygous nonsense variant which is pathogenic and thus solved the diagnostic puzzle. This case demonstrates that the absence of cCMV stigmata should raise concern for alternative etiology in cases of lissencephaly and the importance of genetic evaluation for subsequent management and family counseling.}

However, much of the current literature on psychopathy impairment appears mixed in findings, varying by the traits examined and measured outcomes. The current paper aims to contribute to this field of research by examining how a triarchic model of psychopathy relates to a wide variety of potential consequences, including impairment, personality functioning, interpersonal functioning, internalizing, and perceived quality of life. Through two studies utilizing the Triarchic psychopathy model in undergraduate samples, significant psychopathy impairment was identified. Broadly, disinhibition was related to the most significant impairments across functioning domains. Boldness was more variable and elicited both positive (e.g., higher quality of life, lower self-harm) and negative (impairments in empathy and intimacy) outcomes. Meanness was primarily related to interpersonal difficulties; however, differences in measuring meanness led to different findings on its connection to personality functioning. By better understanding the consequences of psychopathy and how they vary by dimensional traits, interventions can be better tailored to alleviate both individual and societal suffering.}

This research explores the benefits and challenges associated with Gen-AI tools for business improvement from the perspective of business players and academicians. Data comprises of interviews with 7 academicians and 10 European industry players. Several benefits were recognized from the use of Gen-AI in business context, mainly resolution of complex situations and operational improvement of processes. At the optimization level, industry players perceived Gen-AI with more potential than academicians. Advantages of Gen-AI were identified as strongly aligned with data quality. Both academicians and industry players highlight difficulty of identification, collection, and update of relevant data, together with the needed parsimony in decision-making about Gen-AI-produced results. This study corroborates the current awareness of scarcity in trained people to explore the full potential of Gen-AI and highlights the resistance towards its adoption by top management, especially in SMEs, which due to their scale may lack structured data and act more risk averse.}

abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a vital technique for assessing the effectiveness of online advertising. CTR prediction hinges on effectively modeling consumers’ product interests based on their historical behavior. However, extant CTR studies have not fully integrated consumer purchase history with other behavior histories such as browsing, adding to cart, and adding to favorites. How should we fully leverage the rich behavior history to extract personal interest and that of similar others? When extracting similar others’ interests, how should we maintain the relevance to personal interests while enjoying the novelty of others’ interests? To address these issues, we conceptualize two types of consumer interest: manifested interests and potentially shared interests when building their interest profile. We propose the Augmented Deep Multi-Behavior Interest Network (ADMBIN) to extract, integrate, and balance the two types of interest from the multi-behavior sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that the ADMBIN outperforms benchmark models in CTR prediction and the contribution of our design components. The proposed model can boost advertising revenue and improve consumer experience.}

Mental health is an important public health issue in China, compounded by a shortage in psychiatric services. Against this backdrop, digital technologies could offer solutions. Digital mental health interventions use technologies, such as smartphone applications, to improve mental health outcomes. Although there has been a drastic increase in mental health mobile apps available in recent years, current evidence-based digital interventions for mental health are scarce and seldom evaluated for effectiveness and implementation in China. In this Viewpoint, we review digital mental health interventions in China and propose a framework that could guide the development of culturally sensitive digital mental health innovations, with the adoption of co-creation and community engagement strategies. We also provide recommendations to address issues related to usage, interventions, and implementation to improve health equity and implementation of digital mental health interventions in the Chinese context.}

Existing regression-based prediction methods fail to provide visual postoperative observations, which are essential for a comprehensive risk assessment. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of anterior segment structures. In this work, we pioneer the exploration of using the generative adversarial network to predict postoperative AS-OCT images and quantify the clinical parameter. Given the direct contact between the iris posterior surface and ICL anterior surface, the iris critically influences ICL positioning. Motivated by this, we propose a Prior Anatomical Knowledge-guided GAN (PAK-GAN) to enable both accurate vault prediction and visual observation of postoperative anterior segment structures. Specifically, the Iris morphology perception Auxiliary Branches (IAB) are designed to capture the context of the iris position and shape. Additionally, we incorporate a Gaussian weight map into the loss function to strengthen the model’s attention around the iris root region. To validate the performance of our method, we collected paired pre- and post-operative ICL images from multiple hospitals. Comprehensive ablation experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods show that our PAK-GAN achieves the best prediction accuracy for vault and iris position. Furthermore, compared to two clinically used postoperative vault prediction methods, NK-formula and KS-formula, our approach shows the best correlation and agreement with the achieved vault.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Anorectal malformations (ARM) are often accompanied by urological anomalies, which can contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of kidney and urinary tract anomalies, as well as bladder dysfunction, and their potential impact on the development of CKD in children with ARM.
Study design
This single-center, retrospective study included 175 children with ARM, after excluding 75 children with missing data. Clinical and radiological findings and serum creatinine levels were obtained from medical records. Anorectal malformations were classified as “high” and “low” type based on the Wingspread classification, and also further classified by fistula type and sex distribution according to the Krickenbeck International Classification. CKD was defined and staged according to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines.
Results
The median age of the patients was 9.7 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.13:1. Among the 175 patients, 97 (55 %) had intermediate or low-type ARM, and 78 (45 %) had high-type ARM. Kidney and/or urinary tract anomalies were identified in 85 patients (48.5 %), with 63 having kidney anomalies and 71 having urinary tract anomalies. The most common urinary tract anomaly was vesicoureteral reflux (n = 58). Bladder dysfunction was observed in 56 patients (32 %). CKD was diagnosed in 30 patients (17 %); six of them were in CKD stage 5, and the remaining 24 were in stages 2–4. The development of CKD was more common in both females and males with kidney anomalies (p < 0.001), urinary tract anomalies (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), bladder dysfunction (p < 0.001), urinary tract infection (p < 0.001), in addition females with persistent cloaca (p = 0.023) and spinal anomalies (p = 0.013). Kidney anomalies and bladder dysfunction were independently associated with the development of CKD (p < 0.001 and p = 0.046, respectively).
Discussion
This study highlights that approximately half of the children with ARM had kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and one-third had bladder dysfunction. Additionally, almost one-fifth of the patients developed CKD, mostly in the early stages. Our findings also suggest that both kidney anomalies and bladder dysfunction are significant risk factors for CKD development in children with ARM.
Conclusion
This study emphasizes the presence of kidney anomalies, along with bladder dysfunction as risk factors for CKD. Physicians should take care to monitor and manage these risks to minimize the long-term impacts on kidney health in children with ARM.}

abstract = {Background
Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Given its rarity, clinical management often mirrors colorectal cancer dCRC), despite distinct molecular features and inferior outcomes. Although checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy has shown efficacy in mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC, data in SBA remain scarce, and MMR testing is not routinely implemented.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of SBA patients treated with CPI at Copenhagen University Hospital – Herlev between March 2019 and January 2024. Radiological responses were assessed using RECIST v1.1. We also analyzed the frequency of MMR testing and dMMR status in SBA patients.
Results
Among 148 SBA patients, seven received CPI therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was 86%, with one (14%) complete response (CR) and five (71%) partial responses (PR). Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 31 months (mFU:32 months); median overall survival (mOS) was not reached (mFU: 33 months). Overall, 55% underwent MMR testing, and 18% of SBA patients were dMMR.
Conclusion
CPI therapy yields high, durable response rates in dMMR SBA, supporting dMMR as a predictive biomarker. However, inconsistent MMR testing strategy may limit access to optimal treatment. Routine molecular profiling and broader biomarker discovery are key to expanding CPI eligibility and improving outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Medical education can be challenging for students as they must manage vast amounts of complex information. Traditional mnemonic resources often follow a standardized approach, which may not accommodate diverse learning styles.
Objective
This tutorial presents a student-developed approach to creating personalized multimodal mnemonics (PMMs) using artifical intelligence tools.
Methods
This tutorial demonstrates a structured implementation process using ChatGPT (GPT-4 model) for text mnemonic generation and DALL-E 3 for visual mnemonic creation. We detail the prompt engineering framework, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting techniques. The process involves (1) template development, (2) refinement, (3) personalization, (4) mnemonic specification, and (5) quality control. The implementation time typically ranges from 2 to 5 minutes per concept, with 1 to 3 iterations needed for optimal results.
Results
Through systematic testing across 6 medical concepts, the implementation process achieved an initial success rate of 85%, improving to 95% after refinement. Key challenges included maintaining medical accuracy (addressed through specific terminology in prompts), ensuring visual clarity (improved through anatomical detail specifications), and achieving integration of text and visuals (resolved through structured review protocols). This tutorial provides practical templates, troubleshooting strategies, and quality control measures to address common implementation challenges.
Conclusions
This tutorial offers medical students a practical framework for creating personalized learning tools using artificial intelligence. By following the detailed prompt engineering process and quality control measures, students can efficiently generate customized mnemonics while avoiding common pitfalls. The approach emphasizes human oversight and iterative refinement to ensure medical accuracy and educational value. The elimination of the need for developing separate databases of mnemonics streamlines the learning process.}

While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a “skeletonized” form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data used in the method are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.}

The research is based on the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey) dataset and studies the ResNet (Residual Networks) model's method of identifying the number of spiral arms from spiral galaxy images. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the ResNet32 model is 83%, which is the best compared to network models such as ViT (Vision Transformer), EfficientNet, and DenseNet. In terms of recognition of different numbers of spiral arms, there is a strong relationship between recognition accuracy and the number of training samples. There are 6800 images with 2 spiral arms, with an F1-Score value of 0.9, while there are only 237 images with 4 spiral arms, with the lowest F1-Score value. The experiment further analyzed the recognition effect of fused traditional galaxy image features and found that the role of fused traditional galaxy image features in improving the recognition of spiral arms is limited.}

The purpose of our study was to develop a novel magnetic resonance imaging classification system to predict the progression of traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (TONFH) in young adults and assess its clinical implications.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2007 to December 2022, including 134 hips (134 patients, mean age 41 years (range, 21 to 43), 65.7% men) diagnosed with TONFH at Association Research Circulation Osseous Stage I. The bone repair band (BRB) classification system categorized lesions into Superficial (Type S), Uncertain (Type U), and Extensive (Type E) based on magnetic resonance imaging coronal views. Patients were followed with observational treatment and x-ray assessments. Radiographic signs and femoral head collapse were evaluated during follow-up. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between BRB classification and disease progression.
Results
The 134 hips were categorized into Type S (n = 54), Type U (n = 21), and Type E (n = 59). Over a mean follow-up of 39.6 months, radiographic signs were most prevalent in Type E (94.9%) and least in Type S (9.3%), with median times to radiographic signs of 18 months for Type U and 16 months for Type E. Femoral head collapse occurred in 50.8% of Type E, 23.8% of Type U, and none in Type S, with a median time to collapse of 34 months for Type E. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified BRB classification as an independent predictor of disease progression, with Type E showing the highest risk for adverse outcomes.
Conclusions
The newly proposed BRB classification provides a systematic approach to assessing necrotic lesion severity in TONFH and demonstrates significant correlation with femoral head collapse risk. Future studies are needed to further validate its clinical significance and explore the anatomical basis underlying this classification.}

The contemporary management of patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases is complex. This study appraises the recommendations made by national/international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with synchronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
Methods
A systematic review of national and international guidelines published between 2011 and 2024 was carried out using PubMed, OvidSP and Guidelines International Network databases. The quality of guidelines was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. Guidelines were assessed for the quality of advice for specific scenarios. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021243744).
Results
The search strategy returned ninety unique articles with 11 guidelines eligible for inclusion. Of these, one (9 %) guideline defined ‘synchronous disease’ at outset, eight (73 %) recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy as first intervention. Seven (64 %) guidelines supported synchronous hepatic resection with colectomy. One (9 %) recommended against synchronous surgery.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates important variations between international clinical guidelines on diagnostic workup and management of synchronous liver metastases in colorectal cancer. [167 words].}

abstract = {The integration of educational technology into classrooms significantly changes the learning context and offers the potential to support students' metacognitive strategies and thus enhance self-regulated learning (SRL). However, little is known about how teachers leverage this potential. This study examines the beliefs and reported practices of primary school teachers in Switzerland and Germany regarding their promotion of metacognitive strategies through a digital learning environment (DLE, i.e. LearningView). DLEs offer various technological features that can be used to support students’ planning, monitoring, and reflecting on their learning processes. The aim of the study is to understand the teacher’s role in these aspects through the DLE LearningView. Qualitative content analysis of 20 teacher interviews reveals that most teachers adopt a combined approach to the promotion of metacognitive strategies, utilizing both digital and analog methods. In general, teachers used a greater degree of implicit over explicit promotion activities to promote students’ metacognitive strategies in DLEs. The findings suggest a connection between teachers' beliefs and reported practices and highlight the importance of teachers’ perception of themselves as coaches during learning. Our study underscores the need for teacher training to effectively integrate digital and analog approaches for promoting SRL. Given the rapidly changing learning environments due to digitalization, future research should prioritize exploring adaptive learning technology and the role of digital feedback, employing methodologies such as classroom observations or a quantitative methodological approach. Achieving a balanced interplay between teachers, students, and digital tools seems imperative to optimize metacognitive learning in the 21st century classroom.}

Each phase has laid a firm foundation for contemporary Natural Language Process (NLP), enabling huge advances in content generation, dialogue systems, and understanding language. GPT-3 and BERT models expanded their scope from traditional NLP areas to the new realms of screens, audio, images, and video, redefining AI in the process. The future is certain to bring further changes, with prompt engineering likely to become an important skill for making full use of LLMs. By giving clear, context-sensitive, and specific instructions, users can optimize outputs—but issues such as ambiguity, bias, and side effects need to be addressed to ensure that results are ethically sound, accurate, and practical. Just as LLMs continue to move forward, so will the design and best practice of “triggers” change and develop over time. The architecture of LLMs, their training, and their fine-tuning, all based on transformers, attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and encoder-decoder structures, reveals their pros and cons. Computational efficiency should always be the top priority in designing LLMs. Also, there are new development stages to be in the future: in these, propositional knowledge will have more emphasis, and transference both from and between different realms of AI into a new era of intelligent, accountable systems, without which truly likely governance problems may arise.}

abstract = {Introduction
Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has biomechanical advantages but is associated with increased intraoperative bleeding. The role of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing postoperative joint haemarthrosis and improving the short-term outcomes of double-bundle ACLR has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to assess the effects of intraoperative TXA on postoperative joint haemarthrosis and short-term functional outcomes in patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included 80 male patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR between January 2019 and December 2022. The patients were divided into two groups: those who received TXA and those that did not. The TXA group received 50 mL of TXA (10 mg/mL) intravenously approximately 10 min before tourniquet release, followed by an intra-articular injection of 50 mL TXA (10 mg/mL) immediately after wound closure, prior to tourniquet release, whereas the control group did not receive TXA. Primary outcomes included postoperative haemarthrosis volume, assessed using Coupens and Yate (CY) values; and short-term functional recovery, evaluated using range of motion (ROM), quadriceps strength, and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores on day 1, day 15, week 6, and week 12 postoperatively.
Results
Intraoperative administration of TXA in patients undergoing double-bundle ACLR reduced postoperative haemarthrosis, as measured by a lower CY value on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.004) and day 15 (P < 0.001). Compared to patients in the control group, patients in the TXA group reported lower VAS pain scores on day 1 (P < 0.001), day 15 (P < 0.001), and week 6 (P = 0.028), together with improved quadriceps strength (P = 0.043, day 1; P = 0.009, day 15) and ROM (P < 0.001, 12 weeks postoperatively) during the early postoperative period.
Conclusion
The use of TXA during double-bundle ACLR may reduce postoperative joint haemarthrosis and enhance short-term functional outcomes.}

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising for drug delivery due to their high drug-loading capacity, tunable porosity, and structural diversity. However, their clinical translation is hindered by concerns over biocompatibility. Unfortunately, experiments are resource and time intensive, while modeling approaches fail to capture the behavior of MOFs in intricate biological systems. Herein, we report a machine learning (ML)-guided computational pipeline for probing MOF biocompatibility. Using a database of over 35,000 organic molecules, our interpretable ML models predict the toxicity of MOF linkers with over 80% accuracy across different administration routes. Furthermore, we cataloged the toxicity of MOF metallic centers and screened 86,000 MOFs from the Cambridge Structural Database, identifying candidates with minimal toxicity profiles. Beyond screening, our models provide insights into chemical features of biocompatible MOFs—enabling de novo rational design. This framework expedites the discovery of safer MOFs for drug delivery and deepens the understanding of their underlying chemistry.}

While evasion of the variants from adaptive immunity is widely investigated, there is a paucity of knowledge about their interactions with innate immunity. Inflammasome assembly is one of the most potent mechanisms of the early innate response to viruses, but when it is inappropriate, it can perpetuate tissue damage. In this study, we focused on the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We compared the macrophage activation, particularly the inflammasome formation, using Alpha- and Delta-spike virus-like particles (VLPs). We found that VLPs of both variants activated the inflammasome even without a priming step. Delta-spike VLPs had a significantly stronger effect on triggering pyroptosis and inflammasome assembly in THP-1 macrophages than did Alfa-spike VLPs. Cells treated with Delta VLPs showed greater cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β release. Furthermore, Delta VLPs induced stronger cytokine secretion from macrophages and caused essential impairment of mitochondrial respiration in comparison to Alpha VLPs. Additionally, infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages with the SARS-CoV-2 variants confirmed the observations in VLPs. Collectively, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Delta had a greater impact on the inflammasome activation, cell death and mitochondrial respiration in macrophages than did the Alpha variant. Importantly, the differential response to the SARS-CoV-2 variants can influence the efficacy of therapies targeting the host's innate immunity.}

Implemented in a Creative Thinking course at a National University of Science and Technology in central Taiwan, the study randomly assigned 110 freshmen to Experimental Group A (using both System), Experimental Group B (only the Learning Companion System), and a control group. The findings revealed that the experimental groups, particularly Group A, significantly outperformed the control group in boosting information literacy self-efficacy. Moreover, the intervention positively influenced the students' perception of self-regulated learning.

abstract = {Introduction
Enhanced Recovery Pathways (ERP) have gained popularity for optimizing perioperative care, improving patient outcomes, and reducing hospital stays. While extensively studied in adult populations, ERPs in pediatric patients, especially for thyroid surgeries, are uncommon. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an ERP designed for pediatric patients undergoing single-lobe thyroidectomy.
Methods
This prospective study was conducted at Nationwide Children's Hospital from January 2023 to December 2024 and involved children 8 years of age or older undergoing single lobe thyroidectomy. Patients with significant comorbid conditions or undergoing total thyroidectomy were excluded. The ERP incorporated standardized preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. Outcome measures were postoperative pain, incidence of postoperative nausea, time to discharge, and patient/parent satisfaction. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results
16 patients were included, predominantly female (81.3 %, n = 13), ranging in age from 8 to 17 years. The median surgical time was 63 min (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 56.5, 75). Following surgery, patients spent a median of 60 min (IQR: 43, 63.5) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and 217 min (IQR: 189, 260) in the transitional care unit (TCU) before discharge. Adherence to the ERP was high, with 100 % compliance to the order set. 81 % of patients experienced no nausea or vomiting in the PACU/TCU. A single patient required an extended stay due to postoperative nausea, for same-day discharge success rate of 93.8 %. Post-discharge, 93.8 % of patients reported no nausea, and pain was effectively managed without opioid use in 68.8 % of patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No patients required readmission, and all reported high satisfaction with the care received on post-operative satisfaction survey (mean score = 5/5).
Discussion
Implementation of a pediatric ERP for single-lobe thyroidectomy was successful in promoting same-day discharge, effective pain control without opioids, healthcare utilization management, high patient satisfaction. These findings suggest that ERPs can be safely and effectively adapted for select pediatric thyroid surgery, potentially setting a new standard for perioperative care in this population.

Youths from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, girls, and migrants frequently exhibit lower digital competencies, which can contribute to long-term educational and occupational disadvantages. To design educational strategies that promote digital equity, it is essential to understand when and for whom these inequalities emerge. This longitudinal study examined the development of social, gender, and migration-related disparities in digital competencies during adolescence. Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (N = 4872), we examined digital competencies that were assessed three times between ages 12 and 18 with standardized achievement tests. Latent growth curve analyses revealed distinct developmental patterns: socioeconomic disparities were initially large (Cohen's d = −0.22) but decreased over time (Cohen's d = −0.16); gender differences favoring boys were small at first (Cohen's d = 0.07) but widened during adolescence (Cohen's d = 0.18); and the migrant gap was already substantial in early adolescence (Cohen's d = −0.18) and remained stable later on. Comparative analyses for math and reading literacy highlighted partial parallels between digital inequalities and traditional educational inequalities. Overall, the results indicated persistent social, gender, and migration-related disparities in digital competencies throughout adolescence. Because these gaps remained considerable in later adolescence, they appear insufficiently addressed by the current educational system. To reduce digital inequalities, educational interventions may need to begin even before adolescence and target younger children in order to prevent disparities from becoming firmly established.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of FENa (Fractional excretion of sodium), FEK (fractional excretion of potassium) and uSID (urinary strong ion difference) in predicting pAKI in sepsis and septic shock.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
Two intensive care units in Argentina.
Patients
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and AKI, and had a urinary biochemistry within 24h of the AKI diagnosis.
Interventions
None.
Main variables of interest
We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FENa, FEK and uSID through a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis.
Results
80 patients were included. 40 patients presented pAKI. pAKI group had higher APACHE, SOFA score, and mortality rate. In the ROC curve analysis, uSID had no diagnostic utility (AUC=0.52, p=0.69). FENa presented moderate accuracy showing an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60−0.83; p=0.001), while FEK presented low accuracy with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.57−0.80; p=0.04). The optimal Youden point for identifying pAKI was at a FENa higher than 0.51 % with a specificity of 72.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%. In the case of FEK, a value higher than 21.9 % presented the best relation, with a specificity of 67.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%.
Conclusions
urine biochemistry interpretation in septic patients must be revised. FENa and FEK are related to the severity of AKI and could be helpful complementary tools for diagnosing pAKI.

To systematically define humanizing health care to guide systems improvements that better meet patient and health care workers’ needs.
Participants and Methods
We conducted group concept mapping at Johns Hopkins Medicine, a large academic health system with five hospitals in Maryland and Washington, DC, outpatient practices, telemedicine, and homecare services. From October 2023 to May 2024, we recruited participants who brainstormed to the focus prompt: “One thing that can be done to more fully humanize healthcare experiences is:” The study team synthesized ideas for participants to sort them. Group concept mapping software generated cluster maps, which were interpreted by the study team to generate the concept map.
Results
In brainstorming, 63 individuals participated, including those with the perspectives of patients (n=40, 63%), caregivers (n=25, 40%), physicians (n=23, 37%), other types of health care professionals (n=14, 22%), health professions educators (n=28, 44%), and health care researchers (n=25, 40%). The 395 statements from brainstorming were synthesized into 207 ideas for sorting, which was completed by 13 participants. The final concept map included eight domains and 32 subdomains.

abstract = {Most Pathology residents take the Anatomic Pathology and/or Clinical Pathology primary pathology certification examination(s) near the end of their final year of training (i.e., Spring), whereas some postpone the examination(s) to the Fall administration of that year or even later. We compared the Spring and Fall administration pass rates of initial primary certification candidates for those who graduated in the same year they took the examination. We also compared the pass rates of same-year graduates with individuals who postponed the examination for a year or more. We also surveyed the candidates regarding the reasons they chose the Spring or Fall administration. Candidates who chose the earlier (i.e., Spring) administration were more likely to pass compared with those who took the later Fall administration (p = 0.0026 for Anatomic Pathology; p = 0.0004 for Clinical Pathology). Delaying the certifying exams beyond the calendar year of residency graduation was associated with a higher failure rate (p < 0.0001 for both Anatomic and Clinical Pathology). The survey results suggest that residents often take their certification examinations earlier to not interfere with fellowship training, because it coincides with the completion of residency training, or it is expected by their program. Pathology residents are more likely to pass the primary certification examinations when they are taken closer to the end of training, rather than postponing it to a later administration. Pathology residency program directors should encourage residents, who are deemed ready, to take their certification examinations at the earliest possible administration.}

Recently, we found that suppression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) exhibits renoprotective effects in acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The present study investigated the hypothesis that temporal suppression of SPARC in the early stages of I/R-injury might lead to the prevention of renal injury in the chronic phase. The left renal pedicle of male BALB/c mice was occluded for 45 min after right uninephrectomy and subsequently reperfused for 28 days. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting SPARC was injected intravenously 1 day before and 3 days after I/R. Histological assessment revealed that SPARC knockdown by siRNA attenuated tubular injury, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and the overexpression of 4-hydroxynonenal, a marker of lipid peroxidation. I/R-induced overexpression of a major source of superoxide NADPH oxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was suppressed by siRNA targeting SPARC. Treatment with siRNA targeting SPARC reduced the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS1), which colocalizes with SPARC. In conclusion, SPARC might be a potential therapeutic target for preventing CKD development following acute I/R injury.}

To overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on multi-view input and depth estimation, we propose a multi-view synthesis method for Chinese landscape paintings, termed MVSM-CLP. The proposed CLPDepth Module employs a high-low resolution fusion mechanism to enhance detail expression while preserving the original scene structure. We introduce an image restoration technique guided by landscape ink lines, termed LInpainting, to improve edge extraction and the accuracy of painting inpainting Additionally, our method tackles the issue of scarce 3D data in current view synthesis efforts by constructing multi-view data from a single ancient painting. Our approach effectively bridges the gap between 2D art and 3D visualization, creating vivid and realistic virtual environments while preserving the traditional style and essence of Chinese paintings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving high-quality multi-view synthesis, offering new possibilities for the digital preservation of cultural heritage.

abstract = {Background
Surgical consent forms convey critical information; yet, their complex language can limit patient comprehension. Large language models (LLMs) can simplify complex information and improve readability, but evidence of the impact of LLM-generated modifications on content preservation in non-English consent forms is lacking.
Objective
This study evaluates the impact of LLM-assisted editing on the readability and content quality of surgical consent forms in Korean—particularly consent documents for standardized liver resection—across multiple institutions.
Methods
Standardized liver resection consent forms were collected from 7 South Korean medical institutions, and these forms were simplified using ChatGPT-4o. Thereafter, readability was assessed using KReaD and Natmal indices, while text structure was evaluated based on character count, word count, sentence count, words per sentence, and difficult word ratio. Content quality was analyzed across 4 domains—risk, benefit, alternative, and overall impression—using evaluations from 7 liver resection specialists. Statistical comparisons were conducted using paired 2-sided t tests, and a linear mixed-effects model was applied to account for institutional and evaluator variability.
Results
Artificial intelligence–assisted editing significantly improved readability, reducing the KReaD score from 1777 (SD 28.47) to 1335.6 (SD 59.95) (P<.001) and the Natmal score from 1452.3 (SD 88.67) to 1245.3 (SD 96.96) (P=.007). Sentence length and difficult word ratio decreased significantly, contributing to increased accessibility (P<.05). However, content quality analysis showed a decline in the risk description scores (before: 2.29, SD 0.47 vs after: 1.92, SD 0.32; P=.06) and overall impression scores (before: 2.21, SD 0.49 vs after: 1.71, SD 0.64; P=.13). The linear mixed-effects model confirmed significant reductions in risk descriptions (β₁=−0.371; P=.01) and overall impression (β₁=−0.500; P=.03), suggesting potential omissions in critical safety information. Despite this, qualitative analysis indicated that evaluators did not find explicit omissions but perceived the text as overly simplified and less professional.
Conclusions
Although LLM-assisted surgical consent forms significantly enhance readability, they may compromise certain aspects of content completeness, particularly in risk disclosure. These findings highlight the need for a balanced approach that maintains accessibility while ensuring medical and legal accuracy. Future research should include patient-centered evaluations to assess comprehension and informed decision-making as well as broader multilingual validation to determine LLM applicability across diverse health care settings.}

abstract = {Background
Active tuberculosis drug-safety monitoring and management (aDSM) is recommended in the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. We established comprehensive aDSM and conducted a nationwide multicenter prospective study in Taiwan.
Methods
We designed a treatment initiation form to capture characteristics of patients at baseline, a treatment review form to monitor symptoms, blood tests, QT intervals, and audiometry during treatment, and an adverse event report form for reporting severe adverse events (grade 3 or more), serious adverse events and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Severity of adverse events were categorized by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03, and causality was assessed by using the World Health Organization – Uppsala Monitoring Centre system.
Results
Of 333 patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis enrolled from May 2017 to February 2020, 329 (98.8 %) had adverse events and 196 (58.9 %) had severe adverse events during treatment. The top three severe adverse events were metabolism disorders (104, 31.2 %), hearing impairment (102, 30.6 %), and hepatotoxicity (64, 19.2 %). Of 403 severe adverse events reported, 284 (70.5 %) were classified as drug-related. The top five drugs associated with severe adverse events were bedaquiline (27.6 %), clofazimine (26.7 %), kanamycin (25.1 %), pyrazinamide (22.4 %) and linezolid (22.2 %). Forty-four (13.2 %) patients were hospitalized and 15 (4.5 %) had prolonged hospitalization due to adverse events. One death was considered drug-related.
Conclusion
Severe adverse events in the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis were more frequent than previously reported and needed to be closely monitored and timely managed by systematic and comprehensive aDSM.}

abstract = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis because it can characterize tissue based on contrast agent kinetics. Conventional DCE-MRI protocols require multiple imaging phases, including both early and late post-contrast acquisitions, leading to prolonged scanning times that can cause patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and contribute to higher costs and limited availability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive pipeline for synthesizing long-term (late-phase) contrast-enhanced breast MRI images from short-term (early-phase) counterparts, aiming to replicate the behavior of the time-intensity (TI) curve in enhanced regions while maintaining visual properties across the entire image. The proposed approach introduces a new loss function called the Time Intensity Loss (TI-loss), which leverages the temporal behavior of the contrast agent to guide the training of a generative model. Furthermore, as established normalization strategies show undesirable effects on the enhancement behavior, a novel normalization strategy (TI-norm) is also proposed, which preserves the contrast enhancement pattern across multiple image sequences at various timestamps. Additionally, two new metrics are proposed to evaluate the synthesized image quality, i.e., the Contrast agent Pattern score (CPs), which determines the validity of annotated regions according to their enhancement patterns (plateau, persistent, washout), and the average difference in enhancement (ED), which quantifies the difference between the real and generated enhancement in selected regions. Evaluation was performed using a public DCE-MRI dataset that includes studies from 3T and 1.5T scanners with different imaging techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method accurately synthesizes the contrast enhancement response in terms of the TI curve in regions of interest and significantly outperforms other models, while maintaining visual properties comparable to real late-phase contrast-enhanced images. By enabling accurate synthesis of late-phase contrast-enhanced images from early-phase data, our method has the potential to optimize DCE-MRI protocols, reducing scanning time without compromising diagnostic accuracy. This advancement brings generative models closer to practical implementation in clinical scenarios, enhancing efficiency in breast cancer imaging.}

Consultations were audio-recorded, transcribed using Whisper-1 (OpenAI), and converted into structured Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) clinical notes using ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI), implemented through Python 3.11.6. The transcriptions were manually reviewed against gold-standard references, and the ASR performance was quantified using standard metrics from the Jiwer library. Descriptive statistics were computed, and the ChatGPT note quality was evaluated using a standardized checklist, before assessing for statistical significance. The median patient age was 47 years (65 % female). The average interview duration was 15.98 min. Whisper transcribed audio in a median of 59.3 s, and ChatGPT generated SOAP notes in 5.7 s. ChatGPT produced satisfactory results in 85 % of cases, with a significant performance. The ASR system demonstrated acceptable transcription quality. The integration of Whisper and ChatGPT drastically reduced the documentation time compared with manual electronic health record (EHR) entry.

This classical approach demanded significant investments of time and resources to bring a single drug to market. Furthermore, the complexity and vast scale of data from genomics, proteomics, microarrays, and clinical trials present significant challenges in the drug discovery pipeline. Nevertheless, bioinformatics, pharmacoinformatics, and cheminformatics technologies have been developed thanks to breakthroughs in computational methodologies and a surge in multi-omics data, drastically shortening the time it takes to create new drugs. Large amounts of biological data stored in global databases are the building blocks for machine learning and deep learning methods. They make it easier to find patterns and models that can help find therapeutically active molecules with less time, work, and money. Machine learning and deep learning technology are vital in drug design and development. We have applied these algorithms to various drug discovery processes such as protein structure prediction, toxicity prediction, oral bioavailability prediction, de novo design of new chemical scaffolds, structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, and clinical trial design.

abstract = {Objective
To make a cross-cultural adaptation of the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2) from English to Angolan Portuguese.
Methods
A methodological research of cross-cultural adaptation was conducted, involving sequential stages of forward translation, translation synthesis, back-translation, and the application of the Delphi Panel methodology for analyzing semantic, idiomatic, experiential, and conceptual equivalence between the translated and the original versions. This process culminated in the development of a pre-final version, which subsequently underwent testing in a cohort of nurses (n = 37). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient was calculated to assess inter-rater reliability of ratings. Cronbach's alpha was used for evaluating the internal consistency and reliability within the items of the NEWS 2 score.
Results
The cross-cultural adaptation process allowed us to prepare the final version of this tool. The data collected during the testing phase facilitated the examination of inter-rater reliability of ratings and the internal consistency and reliability within the items of the NEWS2 score. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient observed at this step was 0.992. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.993.
Conclusion
The cross-cultural adaptation of the NEWS 2 scoring system to Angolan Portuguese was successful, providing healthcare professionals in Angola with the means to effectively use the tool.}

Estimating noncompliance and understanding its motivations is important for developing strategies to reduce illegality. In Chile, the socio-ecologically important kelp fishery (Lessonia spicata; L. berteorana) is suspected of having high levels of noncompliance. We estimated the levels and types of noncompliance within the fishery directly from small-scale fishers, along with exploring motivations for noncompliance. We did so across four different harvesting regulations, two management regimes, and two geographies. Levels of noncompliance differed across all three factors. Fishers have higher compliance in areas managed with territorial user rights management regimes compared to those managed by regional management plans that establish control rules. However, the differences were more pronounced in one geography compared to another. Fishers show high levels of normative and legitimacy-based motivations with respect to complying with kelp harvesting regulations. In contrast, instrumental motivations were weaker and more heterogenous, which may be tied to noncompliance. Results support the premise that a lack of enforcement may be the main driver of noncompliance in the Chilean kelp fishery. Thus, deterrent mechanisms such as enhancing the perceived likelihood of detection, improving surveillance methods, increasing penalties, and strengthening co-management governance through combining informal and formal mechanisms may help increase compliance.}

To compare pharmacy student scores to scores of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated results of three common platforms on pharmacy skills laboratory assignments.
Methods
Pharmacy skills laboratory course assignments were completed by four fourth-year pharmacy student investigators with three free AI platforms: ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini. Assignments evaluated were calculations, patient case vignettes, in-depth patient cases, drug information questions, and a reflection activity. Course coordinators graded the AI-generated submissions. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize AI scores and compare averages to recent pharmacy student cohorts. Interrater reliability for the four student investigators completing the assignments was assessed.
Results
Fourteen skills laboratory assignments were completed utilizing three different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) by four fourth-year student investigators (n = 168 AI-generated submissions). Copilot was unable to complete 12; therefore, 156 AI-generated submissions were graded by the faculty course coordinators for accuracy and scored from 0 to 100 %. Pharmacy student cohort scores were higher than the average AI scores for all of the skills laboratory assignments except for two in-depth patient cases completed with ChatGPT. Conclusion. Pharmacy students on average performed better on most skills laboratory assignments than three commonly used artificial intelligence platforms. Teaching students the strengths and weaknesses of utilizing AI in the classroom is essential.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chemotherapy can induce a range of unpleasant adverse effects, with oral mucositis being one of the most common. This condition significantly impacts patients' quality of life and can disrupt their adherence to treatment protocols. Oral mucositis serves as an important limiting factor in chemotherapy, often necessitating dose reductions or treatment delays, which in turn can compromise the overall effectiveness of the therapy. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of melatonin mouthwash on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.
Methods
Following the preparation of melatonin and placebo mouthwashes, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients with solid tumor malignancies who had no oral lesions and were treated with chemotherapy regimens. The patients began using the mouthwash on the first day of their corresponding chemotherapy course, continuing for six weeks with a frequency of three times daily, 4mL per application. At the end of each week, the patients were evaluated for the severity and duration of mucositis, as well as the associated pain. Quality of life was assessed at the study's start and weekly thereafter.
Results
Seventy patients were randomized into melatonin (n = 35) and placebo (n = 35) groups. The melatonin group had a lower incidence of mucositis (11.43 % versus 34.28 %), with a relative risk of 0.74 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.56 to 0.96). The severity of mucositis showed statistically significant differences between the melatonin and placebo groups at the end of the fifth week (P = 0.003) and the sixth week (P = 0.002). Additionally, the intensity of pain caused by mucositis demonstrated statistically significant differences at the end of the third week (P = 0.021), the fifth week (P = 0.001), and the sixth week (P = 0.001). There was also a significant difference in the overall duration of mucositis between the melatonin and placebo groups (mean difference -8.83, 95 %CI: -14.54 to -3.12). The mouthwash was well tolerated in both groups.
Conclusion
The findings of this study suggest that melatonin mouthwash is effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced mucositis. A six-week regimen of melatonin mouthwash significantly reduces the severity and duration of mucositis, as well as the associated pain intensity.}

abstract = {Background
The gold standard method for diagnosing low bone mineral density (BMD) is using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) however, most patients with low BMD are often not screened. We aimed to create a deep learning (DL) model to screen for osteoporosis/osteopenia in patients by using radiographs of the foot or ankle.
Method
This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients aged ≥50 years who received X-rays of the foot or ankle and DXA (gold-standard) within 12 months. The 907 (White (96.7 %), Black (1.8 %) and Asian (0.4 %)) patients (3109 radiographs) were randomized (80:20) into training/validation and test datasets, and results were assessed by patient. We developed a novel DL model that extracted deep features from the radiographs of the foot and ankle using a customized architecture. The diagnostic performance of this DL model to predict if a patient had low BMD (osteopenic/osteoporotic) or normal BMD based on DXA, was evaluated with the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).
Results
Mean patient age (standard deviation) was 66.9(9.0) years, and 84.6 % were female. 81.3 % and 18.7 % of patients in the training/validation dataset, and 81.5 % and 18.5 % of patients in the test datasets were osteopenic/osteoporotic and normal respectively. The DL model had an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI (0.85, 0.94), sensitivity of 89.89 %, specificity of 83.65 %, PPV of 90.78 % and NPV of 74.14 % in the test dataset. The model had an accuracy of 94.65 % in the training/validation dataset and 89.89 % in the test datasets.
Conclusion
Our DL model has the potential to identify patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis using foot or ankle radiographs with high accuracy.}

abstract = {Introduction
Medical reports contain critical information and require concise language, yet often display errors despite advances in digital tools. This study compared the effectiveness of ChatGPT 4.0 in reporting orthographic, grammatical, and content errors in German neurology reports to a human expert.
Materials and Methods
Ten neurology reports were embedded with ten linguistic errors each, including typographical and grammatical mistakes, and one significant content error. The reports were reviewed by ChatGPT 4.0 using three prompts: (1) check the text for spelling and grammatical errors and report them in a list format without altering the original text, (2) identify spelling and grammatical errors and generate a revised version of the text, ensuring content integrity, (3) evaluate the text for factual inaccuracies, including incorrect information and treatment errors, and report them without modifying the original text. Human control was provided by an experienced medical secretary. Outcome parameters were processing time, percentage of identified errors, and overall error detection rate.
Results
Artificial intelligence (AI) accuracy in error detection was 35% (median) for Prompt 1 and 75% for Prompt 2. The mean word count of erroneous medical reports was 980 (SD = 180). AI-driven report generation was significantly faster than human review (AI Prompt 1: 102.4 s; AI Prompt 2: 209.4 s; Human: 374.0 s; p < 0.0001). Prompt 1, a tabular error report, was faster but less accurate than Prompt 2, a revised version of the report (p = 0.0013). Content analysis by Prompt 3 identified 70% of errors in 34.6 seconds.
Conclusions
AI-driven text processing for medical reports is feasible and effective. ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated strong performance in detecting and reporting errors. The effectiveness of AI depends on prompt design, significantly impacting quality and duration. Integration into medical workflows could enhance accuracy and efficiency. AI holds promise in improving medical report writing. However, proper prompt design seems to be crucial. Appropriately integrated AI can significantly enhance supervision and quality control in health care documentation.
Zusammenfassung
Einleitung
Arztbriefe enthalten wichtige Informationen und erfordern eine präzise Sprache. Sie weisen jedoch trotz Fortschritten in der modernen Textbearbeitung häufig Fehler auf. Unsere Studie vergleicht die Effektivität von ChatGPT 4.0 bezüglich der Identifikation und Korrektur orthografischer, grammatikalischer und inhaltlicher Fehler in deutschen neurologischen Arztbriefen mit dem Korrekturlesen durch eine medizinisch versierte Fachkraft.
Material und Methoden
Zehn neurologische Musterarztbriefe wurden jeweils mit zehn sprachlichen Fehlern, darunter orthografische und grammatikalische Fehler, sowie einem schwerwiegenden inhaltlichen Fehler versehen. Die Überprüfung durch ChatGPT 4.0 erfolgte anhand dreier unterschiedlicher Eingabeaufforderungen (Prompts): (1) Identifikation von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit tabellarischer Auflistung der Fehler, ohne den Originaltext zu verändern, (2) Erkennung von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit anschließender Erstellung einer überarbeiteten Textversion unter Wahrung der inhaltlichen Integrität, (3) Überprüfung des Textes auf inhaltliche Ungenauigkeiten, einschließlich fehlerhafter Informationen und Behandlungsfehler, mit Fehlerbericht ohne entsprechende Textmodifikation. Als Kontrolle diente eine erfahrene medizinische Schreibkraft. Die Evaluationsparameter umfassten die Bearbeitungszeit, den prozentualen Anteil erkannter Fehler sowie die Gesamtfehlererkennungsrate.
Ergebnisse
Die Fehlererkennungsgenauigkeit der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) betrug für Prompt 1 im Median 35% und für Prompt 2 im Median 75%. Die durchschnittliche Länge der fehlerhaften Arztbriefe lag bei 980 Wörtern (SD = 180). Die KI-basierte Fehleranalyse erfolgte signifikant schneller als die menschliche Korrektur (KI Prompt 1: 102,4 s; KI Prompt 2: 209,4 s; Mensch: 374,0 s; p < 0,0001). Während Prompt 1 als tabellarischer Fehlerbericht schneller, jedoch weniger präzise war, erwies sich Prompt 2 mit einer überarbeiteten Textversion als genauer (p = 0,0013). Die inhaltliche Analyse durch Prompt 3 identifizierte 70% der Fehlinformationen in 34,6 s.
Schlussfolgerungen
Die KI-gestützte Textüberprüfung für Arztbriefe ist schon jetzt praktikabel und effektiv. ChatGPT 4.0 zeigte gute Leistungen mit einer schnellen Fehlererkennung und Fehlerberichterstattung. Die Effektivität der KI hängt maßgeblich vom Prompt-Design ab, das Qualität und Bearbeitungsdauer signifikant beeinflusst. Eine Integration solcher Tools in die Arztbriefschreibung hat das Potenzial, die Genauigkeit und Effizienz des Prozesses zu steigern. KI-Unterstützung stellt daher eine vielversprechende Möglichkeit zur Verbesserung von Arztbriefen dar. Eine smarte Promptgestaltung erscheint auch bei dieser Aufgabe für große Sprachmodelle (LLM) entscheidend zu sein. Durch die Einbindung von KI können die Supervision und die Qualitätskontrolle in der medizinischen Dokumentation erheblich verbessert werden.}

abstract = {Background
Underdiagnosis or undertreatment of osteoporosis consequently impacts individual morbidity and mortality, as well as on healthcare systems and communities as a whole. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard method for identifying osteoporosis, however, opportunistic CT screening is capable of precisely estimating bone mineral density (BMD) in abdominopelvic imaging with no additional cost, radiation exposure or inconvenience to patients. This study uses opportunistic CT screening to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis and anatomic distribution patterns in patients presenting with lower extremity fractures at our institution.
Hypothesis
Trauma patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) are more likely to present with peri-articular versus shaft fractures.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective review of 721 patients presenting as trauma activations to the emergency department (ED) of a Level 1 Trauma Center with lower extremity fractures. Patients were excluded if under the age of 18 or lacking a CT scan upon arrival in the ED. Hounsfield Units (HU) were measured at the L1 vertebral level on CT scans to determine bone mineral density. Values of ≤100 HU were consistent with osteoporosis, whereas 101–150 HU were consistent with osteopenia.
Results
The final cohort included 416 patients, with mean age of 49 ± 21 years. Average bone density was 203.9 ± 73.4 HU. 15.9% of patients were diagnosed as osteopenic and 9.9% as osteoporotic. 64.2% of fractures were peri-articular, 25.7% were shaft, and 10.1% were a combination. Peri-articular fractures were significantly more likely to have lower average BMD than shaft fractures (189 ± 74.7 HU vs. 230.6 ± 66.1 HU, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a significant relationship between low bone mineral density and lower extremity fracture pattern, however, likely influenced by other factors such as sex. Opportunistic CT screening for osteoporosis in trauma settings provides ample opportunity for early detection of low BMD and implementation of highly effective lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy intervention. Reduction in the overall incidence of peri-articular fracture with widespread adoption of opportunistic CT screening may lessen the morbidity, mortality, and total cost currently afflicting patients, healthcare systems, and communities.
