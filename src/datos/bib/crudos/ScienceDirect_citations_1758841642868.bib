abstract = {This study explored the genetic connections between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive isolates using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based genotyping methods and protein profiling of Klebsiella pneumoniae from clinical and environmental sources. PCR-based genotyping, such as enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR and repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (Rep) PCR, and protein profiling using outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and whole cell proteins (WCPs) were studied. Despite their different sources, PCR-based methods revealed genetic similarity between antibiotic-resistant and sensitive isolates. The protein profile also showed varying bands around the 29–43 kDa region. The PCR-based techniques were found to be dependable and repeatable. While the OMPs and WCPs profiles limited the selectiveness of the molecular typing techniques, they could still help determine the most and least frequently occurring protein bands, which would aid in typing K. pneumoniae isolates. To better understand the differences between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive K pneumoniae isolates, PCR-based genotyping techniques were the most effective approach. Protein profiles and antibiogram results provided further insights into the typing process. PCR-based genotyping methods are dependable resources for examining genetic connections among K. pneumoniae isolates, supplemented by insights from protein profiling to improve understanding of their epidemiological relevance and antibiotic resistance mechanisms in hospital environments.}

abstract = {The introduction of transformative generative open AI (GenAI) has impacted science education, presenting opportunities for students and teachers to enhance teaching and learning efficiency. Equally GenAI poses challenges, including risks such as plagiarism and superficial engagement with content. Science teacher education programs play a key role in the way these opportunities are realized and how challenges are dealt with through educating the future generation of science teachers. Science teacher educators face the challenge to remodel their teaching program to showcase how GenAI is used appropriately. Their student teachers face the challenge of working with GenAI in their own learning, but also in their classroom teaching where their students in secondary education might be using GenAI. This interview study explored how science teacher educators and student-science teachers in the teacher training programs of the four technical universities in The Netherlands envisage the potential impact of GenAI on university science teacher education. Few of the teacher educators had actually used GenAI, compared to the number of student teachers that had used GenAI. Potential uses for GenAI in science teacher education and for science teaching in general were identified, as well as desired new learning goals. A strong need for a policy on the use of GenAI was expressed, including a need for clear guidelines and rules. The conclusion presents possible design characteristics for science teacher education to benefit from the advent of GenAI and circumvent associated risks.}

abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist, worsening outcomes. Catheter ablation (CA) is an established therapy, but the optimal timing remains unclear.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of early vs delayed CA on clinical outcomes in patients with AF and HF.
Methods
This International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews–registered systematic review (CRD42025643686) adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Comparative studies enrolling adults with AF and HF were included. Early CA was defined as ablation performed within varying timeframes (often ≤12 months) after AF diagnosis or HF decompensation vs delayed CA beyond that period. Primary outcomes were AF recurrence, all-cause mortality, and HF hospitalizations. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed.
Results
Ten studies (n = 15,822) contributed to the meta-analyses. Early CA was associated with significantly reduced AF recurrence (k = 8, hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.78, P < .0001) and HF hospitalization (k = 5, HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.77, P < .0001). A nonsignificant trend toward reduced all-cause mortality was observed (k = 4, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.41–1.24, P = .23). Statistical heterogeneity was absent for HF hospitalization (I2 = 0%), moderate for AF recurrence (I2 = 67.6%), and high for mortality (I2 = 75.3%). Narrative synthesis included 2 additional randomized controlled trials comparing treatment strategies.
Conclusion
Evidence from pooled observational studies suggests early CA is associated with reduced AF recurrence and HF hospitalization in patients with AF and HF; a mortality benefit was not statistically confirmed. Interpretation warrants caution owing to reliance on observational data and methodological heterogeneity across studies.}

abstract = {During the last decade, nanomaterials and supramolecular assemblies have received considerable attention in different fields of sensing applications. The interest of supramolecular assemblies arises from the exceptional performances of nanostructured films based on such assemblies, which are related to both their well-controlled structure and their large surface area. These characteristics increase the number of active sites and facilitate the charge transport pathways. In addition, supramolecular assemblies can be used to prepare multicomponent sensing layers formed by materials with complementary activity. Finally, supramolecular films are highly efficient platforms for enzyme immobilization leading to highly sensitive biosensing. This paper describes the main concepts and approaches related to the development of supramolecular sensing layers in electrochemical sensors and biosensors. Different techniques commonly employed to develop supramolecular sensing layers, such as Self-assembling, Layer-by-layer and Langmuir-Blodgett, are described and their role as electron mediators in biosensors is revised using milk as an example of the target analyte. Using this approach, enzymes are immobilized in a biomimetic environment, giving rise to efficient biosensors able to detect glucose, galactose or lactose in milk with high degree of selectivity and low limits of detection. We also include a brief discussion of the possibilities of the integration of supramolecular assemblies into sensor arrays as the core of electronic and bioelectronic tongues. The advantages of these systems are related to their fast responses and their capability to detect many components in a single measurement. The expected limitations mainly related to the fouling of the electrodes, are also discussed.}

abstract = {Background
Today, most smartphones provide a digital voice assistant (DVA) for their user, and it is estimated that about 91% of adults report owning and operating a smartphone. A DVA is an automated system preinstalled on technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets, and speakers, which serves to aid users in performing tasks like answering questions, managing smart devices at home, playing music, managing schedules, sending messages, and more. Research with DVA is emerging, and its applicability to health and health care needs to be elucidated.
Objective
The objective of this study was to describe the use of DVAs among primary care patients, as well as purposely sampled clinics including patients with visual and physical disabilities.
Methods
A convenience sample of adult participants was recruited to complete a needs assessment survey to ascertain the interest and possible utility of DVAs to promote and enhance health from among three populations at an academic medical center: (1) general primary care patients recruited from a primary care clinic, (2) patients with visual disabilities recruited from a low vision clinic, and (3) patients with physical disabilities recruited from a physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic. The survey used in this study was a 46-item investigator-developed instrument administered to participants assessing knowledge, use, and perceptions of DVAs, participant interest to participate in related future studies, and demographics.
Results
The results of the survey showed that the majority of participants have used a DVA before (69.7%, 152/218) and were or might be willing to use them in the future (84.0%, 178/212). Participants reported moderate to high concern about the privacy (47.8%, 97/203), security (54.5%, 110/202), and confidentiality (51.7%, 105/203) of DVAs. A greater proportion of those with visual disabilities reported having never used DVA than those without visual disabilities (39.0% vs 24.6%, P=.03). There was no significant difference in reliance on DVAs for participants with and those without physical disabilities (45.0% vs 34.9%, P=.31), indicating that they do not require it for everyday needs.
Conclusions
DVA use remains low among the surveyed participants with physical and visual disabilities. For those with visual disabilities, DVA use was seen to be advantageous in everyday life for tasks such as answering questions and seeking information, but not for those with physical disabilities. However, further research should be conducted that focuses on the use of DVAs by accessing data that represent an individual’s DVA use without being biased by knowledge of a research study. In addition, research is needed on DVA use that includes diverse samples of participants with physical and visual disabilities, which address the barriers to using DVAs for these adult populations.}

abstract = {Background
Learning health systems (LHS) have the potential to use health data in real time through rapid and continuous cycles of data interrogation, implementing insights to practice, feedback, and practice change. However, there is a lack of an appropriately skilled interprofessional informatics workforce that can leverage knowledge to design innovative solutions. Therefore, there is a need to develop tailored professional development training in digital health, to foster skilled interprofessional learning communities in the health care workforce in Australia.
Objective
This study aimed to explore participants’ experiences and perspectives of participating in an interprofessional education program over 13 weeks. The evaluation also aimed to assess the benefits, barriers, and opportunities for improvements and identify future applications of the course materials.
Methods
We developed a wholly online short course open to interdisciplinary professionals working in digital health in the health care sector. In a flipped classroom model, participants (n=400) undertook 2 hours of preclass learning online and then attended 2.5 hours of live synchronous learning in interactive weekly Zoom workshops for 13 weeks. Throughout the course, they collaborated in small, simulated learning communities (n=5 to 8), engaging in various activities and problem-solving exercises, contributing their unique perspectives and diverse expertise. The course covered a number of topics including background on LHS, establishing learning communities, the design thinking process, data preparation and machine learning analysis, process modeling, clinical decision support, remote patient monitoring, evaluation, implementation, and digital transformation. To evaluate the purpose of the program, we undertook a mixed methods evaluation consisting of pre- and postsurveys rating scales for usefulness, engagement, value, and applicability for various aspects of the course. Participants also completed identical measures of self-efficacy before and after (n=200), with scales mapped to specific skills and tasks that should have been achievable following each of the topics covered. Further, they undertook voluntary weekly surveys to provide feedback on which aspects to continue and recommendations for improvements, via free-text responses.
Results
From the evaluation, it was evident that participants found the teaching model engaging, useful, valuable, and applicable to their work. In the self-efficacy component, we observed a significant increase (P<.001) in perceived confidence for all topics, when comparing pre- and postcourse ratings. Overall, it was evident that the program gave participants a framework to organize their knowledge and a common understanding and shared language to converse with other disciplines, changed the way they perceived their role and the possibilities of data and technologies, and provided a toolkit through the LHS framework that they could apply in their workplaces.
Conclusions
We present a program to educate the health workforce on integrating the LHS model into standard practice. Interprofessional collaborative learning was a major component of the value of the program. This evaluation shed light on the multifaceted challenges and expectations of individuals embarking on a digital health program. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of the audience is crucial for creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment. Addressing these challenges will not only enhance participant engagement but also contribute to the overall success of the program and, by extension, the broader integration of digital health solutions into health care practice and, ultimately, patient outcomes.}

In this work, we present a systematic literature research of deception techniques discussed in the scientific literature of the last decade. We systematize the deception techniques, focusing on techniques that use misleading sender, link, and/or attachment information. We identify 23 deception techniques which we classify as either those that email clients should protect users against (13) and those that email clients cannot protect against and thus should be addressed in security awareness measures (10). We propose a security rating for the susceptibility of email clients to these 13 deception techniques and perform an empirical evaluation to analyze the susceptibility of seven representative email clients (web, mobile apps, desktop apps) to these deception techniques. The results of our evaluation indicate that most email clients are in need of improvement to defend against the deception techniques. Hardening email clients against these deception techniques is necessary to increase the resistance against them — without unnecessarily burdening users.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to explain how information technology (IT)-enabled organizational change occurs at varying rates due to the specific characteristics of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The paper investigates the primary determinants of IT-enabled organizational change in these organizations.
Design/methodology/approach
By integrating the resource-based view, organizational learning theory and the entrepreneurial digital ecosystem perspective, this research develops a comprehensive model for analyzing IT-enabled organizational change in SMEs. The conceptual model encompasses five key dimensions: entrepreneurship, technology, human capital, strategic governance and the digital ecosystem. Empirical data were collected from a representative survey of Spanish SMEs, and logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the impact of these factors on the likelihood of IT-enabled organizational change.
Findings
The findings reveal that SMEs led by older or less entrepreneurially driven owners and/or managers are less likely to engage in IT-enabled organizational change. In contrast, SMEs with high digital maturity, motivated and digitally skilled staff, formalized digital strategies and active external collaboration in digital projects are more proactive in implementing IT-enabled organizational changes. Additionally, SMEs that lack formally assigned digitalization roles or concentrate these responsibilities solely on the owner/manager tend to exhibit lower levels of IT adoption.

abstract = {Background
Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and influence cancer development and progression. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered form of cell death, plays an important role in cancer. Nonetheless, additional research investigating the association between cuproptosis-related lncRNAs and prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis is required.
Methods
Sequencing data and copy number variant data were obtained from 492 patients with PCa from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program. Prognostic models of PCa based on cuproptosis-related lncRNAs were constructed using a multi-level attention graph neural network (MLA-GNN) deep learning algorithm. Immune escape scoring was performed using Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion. Cellular experiments were conducted to explore the correlation between key lncRNAs and cuproptosis.
Results
Data from 492 patients with PCa were randomized into two groups at a 1:1 ratio. Prognostic modeling was successfully established using MLA-GNN. Survival analysis suggested that patients could be divided into high- and low-risk groups according to model scores and that there was a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) (P < 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) indicated a strong predictive performance for the model, with AUCs of 0.913, 0.847, and 0.863 for the training group and 0.815, 0.907, and 0.866 for the test group at 12, 36, and 60 months, respectively. The immune escape score and immune microenvironment analysis suggested that the high-risk group corresponded to a stronger immune escape and a poorer immune microenvironment (P < 0.05). Cellular experiments revealed that the expression of all six key lncRNAs was upregulated in the presence of copper ion carriers (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
This study identified cuproptosis-related lncRNAs that were strongly associated with PCa prognosis. Key lncRNAs could affect copper metabolism and may serve as new therapeutic targets.}

We examined how this connectedness predicted lecturers’ self-efficacy in online teaching. This was in addition to other social context variables (connectedness with colleagues and perceived support from the university) and their previous experience with digital tools. The shift to online teaching in the lockdown period abruptly removed any in-person contact between lecturers and their students. Lecturers’ self-efficacy in online teaching is crucial to student motivation, achievement, and the lecturer's own teaching experience. Likewise, lecturers’ connectedness with students and colleagues has been identified as a key factor in learning. Consequently, this study explored how different forms of connectedness predicted lecturers’ self-efficacy in the new teaching environment. A total of 252 lecturers from UK and Swiss universities completed an online survey about their teaching experiences before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Multiple regressions were used to predict lecturers’ online teaching self-efficacy. The results revealed that connectedness with students was a significant and positive predictor of online teaching self-efficacy. However, connectedness with colleagues and perceived support from the university did not. The perception that digital tools enhanced teaching prior to the lockdown was a significant predictor only for the UK lecturers, but not for the Swiss ones. These findings point towards lecturers’ connectedness with their students being a pathway to success in online teaching.}

abstract = {Background and aim
Generative AI (GenAI) can transform nursing education and modernise content delivery. However, the rapid integration of these tools has raised concerns about academic integrity and teaching quality. Previous reviews have either looked broadly at artificial intelligence or focused narrowly on single tools like ChatGPT. This scoping review uses a structured framework to identify patterns, advances, gaps, evidence, and recommendations for implementing GenAI in nursing education.
Methods
This scoping review followed the JBI methodology and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ERIC, and grey literature (October to November 2024). Data synthesis utilised the PAGER framework as a mapping tool to organise and describe patterns, advances, gaps, evidence for practice, and recommendations.
Results
Analysis of 107 studies revealed GenAI implementation across four key domains: assessment and evaluation, clinical simulation, educational content development, and faculty/student support. Three distinct implementation patterns emerged: restrictive, integrative, and hybrid approaches, with hybrid models demonstrating superior adoption outcomes. Technical advances showed significant improvement from GPT-3.5 (75.3 % accuracy) to GPT-4 (88.67 % accuracy) in NCLEX-style assessments, with enhanced capabilities in multilingual assessment, clinical scenario generation, and adaptive content creation. Major gaps included limited methodological rigour (29.0 % of empirical studies), inconsistent quality control, verification challenges, equity concerns, and inadequate faculty training. Geographic distribution showed North American (42.1 %) and Asian (29.9 %) dominance, with ChatGPT representing 83.2 % of tool implementations. Key recommendations include developing institutional policies, establishing quality verification protocols, enhancing faculty training programs, and addressing digital equity concerns to optimise GenAI integration in nursing education.
Conclusions
GenAI has transformative potential in nursing education. To realise its full potential and ensure responsible use, research should focus on developing standardised governance frameworks, empirically validating outcomes, developing faculty in AI literacy, and improving technical infrastructure for low-income contexts. Such efforts should involve international collaboration, highlighting the importance of the audience's role in the global healthcare community.}

Subsequently, it amalgamates this improved algorithm with the sparrow search algorithm to fine-tune the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM). A new generative art evaluation model based on this hybrid algorithm is proposed. Experimental results show that the improved whale algorithm outperforms comparative algorithms, reaching optimal values after 190 iterations in uni-modal and 210 iterations in multi-modal functions. The model also performs well in fitness tests and evaluates AI-generated Paper Cuttings with a mean square error of 0.0101 and a fitting coefficient of 0.987. The proposed model achieves an average evaluation accuracy of 91.3%, outperforming other models in detail refinement, diversity, complexity, and ornamental value. The study offers a highly precise and reliable approach to generative art evaluation.}

By way of this chapter, we delve into differential privacy, a robust solution to guarantee patient privacy in federated learning settings. Differential privacy offers a practical, general, and quantifiable framework for worst-case privacy protection, which is critical when handling sensitive patient data. By utilizing differential privacy in federated learning workflows, strong privacy guarantees can be achieved with often minimal compromises in the utility of shared insights or model performance. This chapter provides an in-depth introduction to how differential privacy can be operationalized by way of discussing its theoretical foundations, practical implementation strategies, and the inherent tradeoff between utility and privacy.}

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection using deep learning techniques plays a crucial role in the pre-harvest estimation of yuzu (Citrus Junos) yield. However, the detection performance of deep learning models heavily depends on the quantity and quality of training data. One of the current challenges is that the work of labeling data is difficult and expensive, because of the high density of fruits, the similarity in color between fruits and leaves, and the varying lighting conditions in the captured images of fruit trees. To address these challenges, we propose to use generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data generation, and then utilize the generated data to improve the yuzu detection performance of YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8 models. In this study, the experimental images were photographed using UAVs from two orchards of Kochi agricultural research center between 2020 and 2022. In our approach, we first trained a conditional GAN called Pix2Pix using pairs of images, where the training inputs are the images of fruit trees with all fruits removed, and the training targets are the original images. Subsequently, we created new regions of interest on the images of fruit trees and used the trained Pix2Pix network to generate yuzu fruits within these regions, thereby generating new labeled images. In the experiments, we merged real and generated images to train YOLO v8-series models and explored to reduce the dependency on real training images through the proposed data augmentation approach. The results showed that the combined training of these generated and real images can significantly improve the detection performance of YOLO v8-series models, with the maximum improvements of 5.4% in F1-scores, 5.6% in mAP50, and 7.1% in mAP50–90, respectively. Moreover, the proposed data augmentation approach allowed for up to a 50% reduction in the amount of real training images while still achieving improved detection results.}

This study used barley as a model plant in non-circulating hydroponics with varying nitrogen levels to simulate space nutrient stress conditions and test nano-fertiliser technology. Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots were applied in solution (hydroponics) and sprayed (aeroponics) to alleviate stress and keep the plant attractive under Space stress. The leaves' greenness was assessed using the soil plant analysis development (SPAD) during plant growth. The study found that plants grown under ‘high nitrogen’ (1 mM) conditions had higher SPAD and shoots-to-roots ratio (S/R) could reach as high as 31, and 3.2, respectively. In contrast, ‘low nitrogen’ grown plants were less green and bushy, wherein the SPAD and S/R were 11.2 and 1.03, respectively. The foliar fertilisation (FF) treatment turned out to be effective for the biophilic parameters, provided it started early, i.e. after one-week of plant growth. Applying an FF after two weeks was found to be less effective because the fresh S/R increased from 1.93 to 2.94. The FF treatment slightly increased the SPAD for the ‘low nitrogen’ sample by comparison to the control sample (no FF). Regardless of the treatment, the fresh shoot weight decreased under ‘low nitrogen’, except when being boosted by a high concentration (100 mg/l) of the nano-fertiliser quantum dots. Nonetheless, the fresh shoot weight of ‘low nitrogen’ growth was almost identical to ‘high nitrogen’ growth, which were 1.88 g and 2.20 g, respectively. These findings epitomise the potential of the nano fertiliser to reduce nitrogen use in plants. The results from the best experimental data gathered (greenness, shoots/roots, leaf number/shape) were implemented in a visualisation of an early-stage idea for the Spaceship interior using an artificial intelligence (AI) SDXL 1.0 model. Plant growth experiments in a home-built spacecraft replica confirmed that the use of LN (0.5 mM) conditions can be favourably used under ‘real-space conditions’ and that the nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dot nanofertiliser is effective for creating biophilic SPAD value.}

Among Aeromonas species, A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. veronii, and A. dhakensis are clinically important species that cause infections in humans, leading to diarrhea associated with gastroenteritis, necrotizing fasciitis, and sepsis. A. dhakensis is a newly established species that was reclassified in 2013, and it is considered more pathogenic than other Aeromonas species. However, accurate identification of Aeromonas species by biochemical characteristics, mass spectrometry, and 16S rRNA gene analysis can sometimes be difficult. In this study, 24 strains were classified into nine species by homology and phylogenetic analysis of the RNA polymerase B subunit gene (rpoB), the gold standard method for identifying Aeromonas species. The results of 16S rRNA gene analysis were consistent with those of rpoB analysis for all strains. The results of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were consistent with those of rpoB analysis for all strains excluding A. dhakensis; however, all five A. dhakensis strains were misidentified as other species. Therefore, we attempted to develop species-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for four pathogenic Aeromonas species. The results of these PCRs were completely consistent with those of rpoB gene analysis. These PCR-based methods can permit the identification of pathogenic Aeromonas species, especially A. dhakensis, more quickly and simply than conventional methods.}

We aimed to investigate the involvement of interhemispheric cortical dynamics as measured by combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) in recovery of upper limb (UL) motor functions in chronic stroke patients.
Methods
Ten patients with a history of single ischemic chronic stroke were enrolled (4F, 63.8 ± 9.9 years). Each patient underwent TMS-EEG recordings to evaluate interhemispheric cortical dynamics as well as a reaching task recorded with inertial measurement units, and a series of clinical assessments. TMS-EEG neurophysiological data were analysed considering spatiotemporal, power response, and interhemispheric balance (IHB) dynamics.
Results
We found that IHB index (IHBi) and low-frequency power (LFP) (4–13 Hz) in the affected hemisphere were associated with the degree of UL impairment.
Conclusion
Increased IHBi due to stroke is an unfavourable factor of UL’ functions. Similarly, LFP of both hemispheres is strongly correlated with clinical and kinematic outcomes.
Significance
TMS-EEG biomarkers of interhemispheric unbalance could be used to estimate functional recovery and drive tailored neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation approaches.}

This ex vivo study investigated the effects of pre-treatment either with or without a deproteinization procedure using a sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution on percentage resin infiltration in natural non-cavitated proximal subsurface carious lesions of (pre)molars. Moreover, we studied whether a correlation exists between lesion size and infiltration area.
Methods
Extracted human premolars and permanent molars (n = 40 each) with macroscopically non-cavitated proximal subsurface carious lesions (ICDAS code 2/radiographic E2 and D1 lesions) were randomly divided into two groups. In Group 1 (control), the carious lesions underwent a standard resin infiltration protocol (deploying 15 % hydrochloric acid, 99 % ethanol, and Icon Caries Infiltrant). With the specimens of Group 2, a deproteinization step using 1 % NaOCl was applied prior to the standard infiltration procedure. Teeth were sectioned mesio-distally (perpendicular to their occlusal tooth surface and through the proximal lesion) and polished to the deepest lesion extension (as defined by DIAGNOdent). Total lesion sizes and infiltration areas were analyzed via confocal laser scanning micrographs. Paired data were submitted to linear regression analysis employing SPSS (v29.0).
Results
With the deproteinized specimens (Group 2), a significantly higher percentage of resin infiltration (p = .003) was observed, along with a strong positive correlation between lesion size and infiltrated area (r = .97; p < .001), if compared to Group 1 (r = .89; p < .001).
Conclusions
Deproteinization with NaOCl prior to resin infiltration significantly enhances the infiltrant’s penetration ability into non-cavitated carious lesions, resulting in a strong relationship between lesion size and infiltrated area.
Clinical significance
Deproteinization by means of NaOCl solution should be implemented as an integral step and key component to the standard infiltration protocol to significantly improve the resin infiltrant’s penetration ability into initial subsurface lesions.}

abstract = {Daily sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer from 1982 to 2020 were used to study the spatiotemporal variability and climatology of SST in the Azores. In addition, the relationships between the SST anomaly (SSTA) and three climate index time series for the period 1982–2020 were investigated: the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. The spatiotemporal variability and climatology of the SST were studied by analyzing annual, seasonal, and monthly mean SST time series and climate fields. Relationships between the SSTA and climate index time series were investigated using Pearson's correlation analysis and wavelet coherence analysis. The annual mean SST time series shows a positive linear trend of about 0.027°C per year over the period 1982–2020. The spatial variability of the linear trend shows that the positive trend is consistent throughout the study area, ranging from 0.024 to 0.034°C per year. The spatial variability is not uniform, and high values of the trend are observed in the upper northwestern part and southwestern half of the basin. Seasonal mean SST fields show a positive North-South latitudinal gradient, with higher temperatures in the south, especially in the southwestern basin. In addition, the seasonal mean SST fields show possible coastal upwelling signatures along the coast of the Azores islands in different seasons. The results of Pearson's correlation analysis between basin-averaged, de-trended monthly mean SSTA and climate indices show that SSTA shows a significant positive correlation with SOI and a negative correlation with ONI from 1982 to 2020. NAO shows positive correlation with SSTA for the December-January-February season. Wavelet coherence analysis confirms significant coherences between the Azores SSTA and the climate-ocean indices at certain time scales and periods.}

And specifically for the present discussion, what it means for agency. In offering our contributions to these considerations, we build on approaches to treat AI not as a “thing” but as phenomena in-the-making. Such a framing orients us to doings, to practices, to enactments, and consequential outcomes. These considerations of AI-in-the-making are inspired by agential realism, a theory that calls attention to performativity and accountability. Based on these ideas, we propose a sociomaterial genealogical approach that we suggest is well-suited for the study of AI-in-the-making. In so doing, we provide qualitative scholars with a way of orienting their inquiries toward the performativity of ongoing AI reconfigurations and sociomaterial accountabilities.}

abstract = {Background
Nucleolus complex-associated 4 homologue (NOC4L), a ribosome biogenesis factor essential for small subunit processome assembly, has demonstrated oncogenic potential across multiple malignancies. Nevertheless, the mechanistic contributions of NOC4L to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) pathogenesis remain poorly characterized. This study systematically investigates the expression, clinical relevance, and molecular functions of NOC4L in LUAD.
Methods
We analyzed RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD cohort and normal lung tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to quantify tumor-specific NOC4L expression. Functional enrichment analysis employing Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways revealed associations with ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional dysregulation. Single-cell RNA analysis were interrogated to identify cellular subpopulations with elevated NOC4L expression. Immune microenvironment alterations were evaluated using ssGSEA algorithms, while methylation aberrations were mapped via MethSurv. The STarBase database and prognostic model were utilized to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks regulating NOC4L. siRNA mediated NOC4L knockdown in A549 and H1299 LUAD cell lines was performed to assess phenotypic impacts through CCK-8 proliferation assays, colony formation analyses, and migration experiments.
Results
NOC4L exhibited significant overexpression in LUAD compared to normal tissues (P<0.001), correlating with advanced TNM staging. Enrichment analysis indicated that NOC4L is associated with key pathways involved in cancer development. Single-cell analysis localized NOC4L overexpression predominantly within fibroblast subpopulations (c-9 cluster). High NOC4L expression correlated with immune microenvironment disorders, abnormal methylation levels, and mutations. Mechanistic studies identified the SNHG1/LINC00662-miR-101-3p axis as the predominant ceRNA regulator of NOC4L. Functional silencing of NOC4L significantly inhibited the proliferation, clone formation, and migration abilities of LUAD cells.
Conclusions
NOC4L as an oncogenic protein promotes the cancer progression related to immune infiltrates, which underscores that NOC4L is a promising diagnostic and prognostic marker that may facilitate targeted therapies in LUAD.}

A pivotal step in the development of such interventions involves translating theoretical intervention techniques into specific technological features. However, practical guidelines on how to approach this translation are currently underdeveloped. To support efforts to develop digital mental health interventions, from theoretical inception to an actual digital intervention, we present the Digital Intervention Development Guide (DID-Guide). The DID-Guide is structured into two distinct phases. Phase 1 establishes the intervention's theoretical foundation, outlining the steps for developing a theoretical intervention framework. Phase 2 translates this theoretical framework into actionable technological features, that make up the intervention. We break down the DID-Guide's two phases into a series of actionable steps, accompanied by concrete examples from a recent intervention that can be delivered through both a smartphone app and Virtual Reality. The DID-Guide serves as a comprehensive resource for creating impactful digital mental health interventions, while also facilitating collaboration and communication among a diverse range of stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and software developers.}

Professional training methods are available but are often prohibitively expensive, limiting opportunities primarily to privileged individuals. To bridge this accessibility gap and democratize access to job opportunities, there is a need to develop automated interview simulation platforms. The advent of Generative AI (GenAI) technology, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), makes this is viable proposition but progress is hindered by the absence of open-source implementations for reproducibility and comparison, as well as the lack of suitable evaluation benchmarks and experimental setups. In particular, we do not yet know how robust such systems are and if they will be bias-free, factors that will contribute to their acceptability and use. To this end, we propose Interview Training and Education Module (ITEM), a job interview training module that combines Virtual Reality-based metaverse technology with LLM-based GenAI models. Our module creates realistic interview experiences for skill enhancement, complete with personalized feedback and improvement guidelines based on user responses. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of the module to ascertain its robustness, including a bias analysis. Firstly, we establish an experimental setup to gauge platform robustness by examining question similarity across varied prompts using Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and topic modeling. Subsequently, we explore biases in three categories—country of origin, religion, and gender—by analyzing ITEM's evaluation scores while manipulating candidate backgrounds, all while keeping their responses unchanged. Our findings indicate potential biases replicated by ITEM, highlighting the need for caution in its application for personal development and training. This pioneering initiative introduces the first open-source module for job interview training within a virtual metaverse, leveraging LLM-based Generative AI, designed for extension and testing by the scientific community, thereby enhancing insights into the limitations and ethical considerations of AI-driven interview simulation platforms.}

While their impact on crumb stability in conventionally baked breads has been explored, the role of these interactions when using alternative baking technologies remains understudied. This study aimed to determine how non-covalent interactions affect rheological, nutritional and technological properties of gluten-free (GF) bread when baked using a deck oven or ohmic heating (OH). A GF formulation composed of maize starch and six structurally different non-gluten proteins was tested. Rheological and pasting properties, bread volume and starch digestibility were evaluated to study the significance of these interactions. Batter analyses indicated that protein functionality, particularly free sulfhydryl groups and surface hydrophobicity, strongly influenced pasting. Critical strain (0.09–0.14%) and flow transition points (1.01–3.69%) varied with protein type, showing distinct microstructural variations within the batter. Non-covalent interactions, especially hydrophobic and electrostatic forces, played a major role in stabilizing the OH bread, while conventional baking probably relied more on covalent interactions. Hydrogen bonding between polymers contributed to an increase in resistant starch (RS). This study revealed that specific non-covalent interactions played a crucial role in the structural and nutritional properties of GF bread, particularly when applying OH.}

The long-term effectiveness of vortioxetine for facilitating progress toward personal recovery goals and improving productivity at work was assessed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
Single-arm, prospective, 24-week cohort study in employed patients with MDD initiating treatment with vortioxetine (n = 121) in outpatient settings in Japan. The Goal Attainment Scale for Depression (GAS-D) was used to evaluate progress toward personal recovery goals. At baseline, a combination of patient-defined and pre-specified goals was established collaboratively with the treating psychiatrist, followed by longitudinal assessments at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Work-related productivity was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. Co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving their pre-specified personal recovery goals at week 12 and the change in work productivity from baseline.
Results
In all, 45/107 patients (42.1%) had achieved their personal recovery goals at week 12, increasing to 62/100 (62.0%) at week 24. Significant improvement was observed across all WPAI domains (i.e., absenteeism, presenteeism, productivity loss, and activity impairment) at week 24. Depressive symptoms, global patient functioning, emotional and cognitive symptoms, cognitive performance, and quality of life also significantly improved over the 24 weeks of follow-up. At week 24, 80/102 patients (78.4%) remained on vortioxetine; 49 of these patients (61.3%) were receiving vortioxetine 20 mg/day.
Limitations
Open-label study.
Conclusions
Vortioxetine was found to be effective in helping to achieve personal recovery goals and in enhancing workplace productivity over the 6-month study period in patients with MDD.

abstract = {Context
The reduction of N fertilization in agriculture as part of the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy plays a central role in the integrated nutrient management action plan of the European Commission. However, the implications of this strategy for mitigating N losses and possible side-effects on grassland yields under global change are largely unknow.
Objective
We examined how a 20% reduction in N fertilization according to the F2F strategy is likely to impact yields, N2O emissions and N leaching of four intensively managed temperate grasslands in the Alpine region, two of them located in Switzerland, the other two in Germany.
Methods
Following automatic data-driven calibration supported by inverse modeling and a cross-validation step, the process-based model DayCent was used for conducting the analysis. Global change scenarios under the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 and a baseline scenario (current climate) were created for the time frame 2041–2060 with the help of the stochastic weather generator LARS-WG.
Results and conclusions
Our results indicated that, under current conditions of climate and CO2 levels (400 ppm), a 20% decrease in N fertilization would lead to a 5% drop in yields, but also in a 15% decline in N2O emissions and a 21% decline in N leaching (largely as NO3−). Under global change conditions (i.e., climate change and higher atmospheric CO2 levels), we found that increased yields, mainly induced by higher CO2 levels, are likely to compensate for yield losses resulting from the reduction in N fertilization. In addition, we found that the effectiveness of the F2F strategy to mitigate N losses is likely to be preserved under global change, still with stronger effect on N leaching. The F2F-induced decline in N losses was stronger when the latter were expressed per unit of harvested dry matter, i.e., up to 17% for N2O and up to 42% for N leaching. Although significant, these abatements in N losses are still below the 50% reduction level envisaged by the F2F strategy. Actions related to other axes of the strategy (e.g., sustainable food consumption) will be necessary to further reduce N fertilization and, therefore, to reach this ambitious goal.
Significance
Our results highlight the usefulness of models in accounting for interacting effects of global change and mitigation practices on multiple ecosystem services of grasslands. They allow quantification of the impact of new policies.}

The laths of martensite in the 850℃ quenched as-deposited steel specimen is apparently finer than that in the 800℃ quenched as-cast one. The two as-quenched steels at the optimized temperature above, compared with the other temperatures, exhibited the highest microhardness and the ultimate tensile strength (σuts). Additionally, much more dispersed carbides of Fe3C and Fe7C3 precipitated in the tempered martensite in the as-cast steel specimen after tempering treatments. The quenching at the optimized temperature of 850℃ led the as-deposited steel to have high σuts of 1179 MPa, however low total elongation (εtotal) of 14.3 %. In contrast, tempering at 180℃ for 2 h on the as-deposited steel specimen resulted in the lower σuts of 1161 MPa, however higher total elongation (εtotal) of 16.7 %.}

For triangulation, we also conducted stimulated recall interviews so as to gain information about learners’ levels of noticing of target language areas. Both eye-tracking and stimulated recall interviews demonstrated greater levels of attention to lexical recasts than morphological and syntactic ones. In particular, lexical recasts led to more and longer fixations, and more returns to target features. The stimulated recall comments support this finding. Learners noticed target areas when lexical recasts were provided; whereas they perceived the majority of morphological and syntactic recasts as clarification requests or confirmation checks.}

In a preregistered 2x2 online experiment, participants from Austria, Denmark, France, and Serbia (Ntotal = 1951) encountered written scenarios about their health that manipulated disease threat (low vs. high) and stigma (low vs. high). The sample was stratified to ensure representativeness for age, gender, and educational level across the countries studied. Results showed no main effect of disease threat on AI information-seeking intentions, but stigma significantly influenced preferences, particularly in mild health conditions. Participants were more likely to consult AI over peers for stigmatized conditions, highlighting the role of AI's anonymous interface in reducing social judgment. Country differences further revealed that national contexts also shape AI adoption: while participants in Denmark and France showed a stronger preference for AI over peers, those in Serbia and Austria preferred peers over AI. Additionally, AI trust and literacy emerged as the strongest predictors of both AI usage intentions and preferences. These findings indicate that gen AI tools can play a complementary role in the health information ecosystem, particularly for stigmatized conditions and in contexts where traditional sources are perceived as less accessible or judgment-free.}

abstract = {This study introduces a novel, automated methodology for extracting urban building typologies from digital land cadastres using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Unlike traditional shape clustering approaches, that depend on predefined rules or manual labelling, the method employs unsupervised learning to identify building typologies, based solely on geometric features, derived from roof-print shapes. Leveraging a large-scale dataset of over 100,000 buildings from the Seville, Spain cadastre, the VAE has been trained with augmented data to generate a latent space that captures dominant morphological patterns. The analysis has revealed 24 to 26 distinct building typologies, encompassing both prevalent and rare urban forms. The approach effectively filters out non-representative shapes and is scalable for application across entire cities. By automatically identifying representative building shapes, the method facilitates the creation of parametric structural models, which are essential for developing machine learning tools to predict seismic damage. This replicable and automated strategy significantly reduces the time and resources required for typology-based seismic vulnerability assessments, providing valuable support for civil protection agencies and urban planners.}

abstract = {Chromogranin A (CgA), a ∼ 49 kDa acidic secretory protein, is ubiquitously distributed in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells and neurons. As a propeptide, CgA is proteolytically cleaved to generate several peptides of biological importance, including pancreastatin (PST: hCgA250–301), Vasostatin 1 (VS1: hCgA1–76), and catestatin (CST: CgA 352–372). VS1 represents the most conserved fragment of CgA. A 20 amino acid domain within VS1 (CgA 47–66) exhibits potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Autism is known to be associated with inflammation. Therefore, we seek to test the hypothesis that VS1 modulates autism behaviors by reducing inflammation in the hippocampus. Treatment of C57BL/6 (B6) and BTBR (a mouse model of idiopathic autism) mice with VS1 revealed the following: BTBR mice showed a significant decrease in chamber time in the presence of a stranger or a novel object. Treatment with VS1 significantly increased chamber time in both cases, underscoring a crucial role for VS1 in improving behavioral deficits in BTBR mice. In contrast to chamber time, sniffing time in BTBR mice in the presence of a stranger was less compared to B6 control mice. VS1 did not improve this latter parameter. Surprisingly, sniffing time in BTBR mice in the presence of a novel object was comparable with B6 mice. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1b, as well as other inflammatory markers, were elevated in BTBR mice, which were dramatically reduced after supplementation with VS1. Interestingly, even Beclin-1/p62, pAKT/AKT, and p-p70-S6K/p70-S6K ratios were notably reduced by VS1. We conclude that VS1 plays a crucial role in restoring autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) plausibly by attenuating neuroinflammation.}

The trial took place at 24 primary care clinics randomised to deliver a task-shared psychological intervention or treatment as usual (TAU). The trial enrolled 1119 participants meeting criteria for probable depression. Depression symptom severity was evaluated at baseline and 24-month follow-up. Using a concentration index (CI), SEIs in depression were assessed for the intervention and TAU arms. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were used to decompose the CI to identify contributors to SEI. Results indicate poorer participants at the intervention arm have significantly worse 24-month outcomes than wealthier counterparts (CI = – 0.080; SE = 0.025). Race (34.2%), unemployment (17.4%) and food insecurity (15%) were the main contributing factors. While policymakers need to invest in psychological interventions to reduce the burden caused by depression, this study suggests treatment outcomes may be different across the socioeconomic spectrum. Decomposition of these findings points to structural constraints, such as unemployment, as the key contributors towards poorer treatment outcomes. These findings suggest a need to combine psychological interventions with structural interventions that address the broader socio-economic determinants of mental health.}

abstract = {Background
The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the etiology of autism and its sex-biased prevalence remain largely elusive. We have previously shown that children with non-syndromic low-functioning idiopathic autism exhibit a sexually dimorphic pattern of relative telomere length (RTL), with autistic male children having significantly shorter RTL than autistic female children, healthy controls, and paired siblings. By contrast, a number of autistic girls had longer RTLs than healthy controls. Here, we investigated levels of telomeric oxidized base (TelOB) lesions among the same study subjects and groups.
Methods
Employing a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based method, which combines DNA digestion targeting oxidized bases and telomere measurement, TelOB lesions were measured using genomic DNA extracted from saliva samples collected from 24 children (14 male and 10 female) with autism, 10 paired siblings, and 24 sex, age, and location-matched typically-developing controls.
Results
Our findings show that both male and female autistic children exhibit substantially higher TelOB lesions at their telomeres than healthy controls and paired siblings. Interestingly, these elevated levels of TelOBs show a direct correlation with RTL values in autistic children but not in healthy controls. However, TelOB levels do not show any association with age either in the autistic children or the healthy control group.
Conclusions
Our findings open a fresh angle into autism spectrum disorders (ASD), raise new questions, and lay the foundation for further research into telomere biology and underlying molecular mechanisms involved in ASD. TelOB levels are likely set during early development and may serve as biomarkers for childhood autism.}

Our robust framework integrates three innovative AI models for essential functionalities: road detection, traffic sign recognition, and obstacle avoidance. The system architecture, structured around a three layers “DDD” (Data, Detection, Decision) approach, involves meticulous data preprocessing for traffic signs and road data, followed by specialized Deep Learning models for each detection task, including a CNN for traffic signs, a CNN for road detection, and the pre-trained MobileNet-SSD for obstacle detection. A reinforcement learning agent in the Decision Layer processes these outputs for real-time control (steering, acceleration, braking) through a continuous learning process with environmental feedback. The research encompasses both extensive simulation in Unity, leveraging the ML-Agents toolkit for agent training across diverse environments, and crucial real-world deployment. Our reward/punishment system in the simulation environment, based on collisions with road markers and obstacles, refined the agent’s decision-making. The trained AI models were successfully exported and deployed onto a physical prototype, controlled by a Raspberry Pi and equipped with a camera and ultrasonic sensors. Real-world testing affirmed the robust performance of the physical model in detecting roads, recognizing traffic signs, and effectively avoiding obstacles. Quantitative results demonstrate compelling performance, including over 90% accuracy in obstacle detection and a 15% improvement in navigation efficiency compared to traditional algorithms under controlled simulation conditions. Model evaluation metrics show a 98% accuracy, 12% loss, and a prediction rate exceeding 77%. This study not only contributes a comprehensive framework for autonomous vehicle development but also highlights the transformative potential of deep reinforcement learning for creating intelligent and adaptable autonomous systems in both virtual and real-world scenarios, paving the way for safer and more efficient transportation technologies.}

The report issued by the UN in 2022 highlighted that the global education crisis for vulnerable groups has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, war, lack of infrastructure, and little or no psychosocial support. The prevalence of English as the medium of instruction in higher education, is a challenge for students who speak English as a second language. In South Africa, and Africa as a whole, the majority of the population speak in their mother tongue as a first language, which is problematic for students enrolled at English medium universities. This study focuses on accounting education from a South African perspective. Earlier research found that the number of African chartered accountants in South Africa are inadequately represented and cited one of the reasons as being a language barrier. We propose that the translation of accounting concepts into indigenous African languages can improve the understanding of accounting principles which will allow for inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all. In doing so, we develop a prototype application, which encompasses augmented reality and artificial intelligence-generated language translation functionalities to teach accounting principles in an indigenous African language, namely, IsiZulu. The application, named Zulu Augmented Reality Translation (ZART), aids the learning process of accounting principles, by providing an engaging and interactive learning experience in IsiZulu. The paper commences with a literature review on the teaching pedagogy and challenges in accounting education. Thereafter, the design science research applied in the development of ZART is discussed. Using questionnaires, an experiment is conducted to evaluate the usability of ZART, students’ perceptions and pedagogical experiences of using ZART. The results of the evaluation show that ZART was easy to install and use; students were captivated with the avatars in ZART; and the language translation functionality was useful for learning the basics of accounting. ZART is of importance to policy makers and standard setters in the accounting profession, accounting academics, and accounting students. This study provides a platform for the translation of the accounting curriculum into numerous indigenous African languages.}

While fillet color scoring traditionally relies on subjective visual inspection using color reference cards or labor-intensive color measurement using a colorimeter, this study aims to develop a smart handheld device (FilletCam AI, hereafter referred to as ‘FilletCam’) for precise and rapid profiling of fish fillet color. FilletCam comprises an imaging sensor integrated with an embedded computing unit for image acquisition. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to streamline data collection, analysis, visualization, compilation, and data sharing with authorized users. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) model was developed and deployed on the edge for region-of-interest (ROI) detection. A single-stage YOLOv8 model was trained on a custom image dataset comprised of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fillet images to detect the fillet and color palette with their respective SalmonFan™ (SF) score on the reference card. Delta E metric was adopted to compare the color of the fillet and reference color shades on the SF card. The SF score corresponding to the lowest Delta E value was assigned to the fillet. The object detection model performed well and achieved a mean average precision (mAP0.5) of 99.5 % and an F1 score of 0.99. The FilletCam-predicted fillet color scores were compared with the expert ratings and colorimeter scores to evaluate the performance of the developed tool. The minimum Delta E values for FilletCam were consistently lower than those for the colorimeter, indicating FilletCam's ability to detect minor color differences accurately. FilletCam exactly predicted the color scores at 73 % of instances compared to 30 % of instances for the colorimeter. Additionally, for only 3 % of instances, the predicted SF score deviated by more than two points. Overall, the developed research prototype shows promise as a valuable digital tool for the fish processing and retail industries.}

abstract = {Background
Prevention of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) has been the focus of many system-wide clinical decision support (CDS) tools, which can be directly embedded within the framework of the electronic health record system and triggered to alert in high-risk patients when a known QT-prolonging medication is ordered. Justification for these CDS systems typically lies in the ability to accurately predict which patients are at high risk; however, it is not always evident that identification of risk alone is sufficient for appropriate CDS implementation.
Objective
In this investigation, we examined the impact of a system-wide, alert-based, inpatient CDS tool designed to prevent diLQTS across 10 known QT-prolonging medications.
Methods
We compared the risk of diLQTS, duration of hospitalization, and in- and out-of-hospital mortality before and after implementation of the CDS system in 178,097 hospitalizations among 102,847 patients. We also compared outcomes between those in whom an alert fired and those in whom it did not, and within the various responses to the alert by providers. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, inpatient location, electrolyte values, and comorbidities, with the latter processed using an unsupervised clustering analysis applied to the top 500 most common medications and diagnosis codes, respectively.
Results
We found that the simple, rule-based logic of the CDS (any prior electrocardiograph with heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc)≥500 ms) successfully identified patients at high risk of diLQTS with an odds ratio of 2.28 (95% CI 2.10-2.47, P<.001) among those in whom it fired. However, we did not identify any impact on the risk of diLQTS based on provider responses or on the risk of inpatient, 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year mortality. When compared with rates prior to implementation, the risk of diLQTS was not significantly different after the CDS tools were deployed across the system, although mortality was significantly higher after the tools were implemented.
Conclusions
We found that despite successful identification of high-risk patients for diLQTS, deployment of an alert-based CDS did not impact the risk of diLQTS. These findings suggest that quantification of high risk may be insufficient rationale for implementation of a CDS system and that hospital systems should consider evaluation of the system in its entirety prior to adoption to improve clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
The association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia remains debated, and data from Mediterranean populations are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between AF and dementia in a large Catalan cohort, with a particular focus on identifying subgroups with the strongest associations.
Methods
We conducted a population-based observational study including individuals aged ≥45 years without prior diagnosis of dementia. Data were obtained from the System for the Development of Research in Primary Care, which covers more than 80% of the Catalan population. Dementia was identified using ICD-10-CM codes and prescription records. Early-onset dementia (EOD) was defined as diagnosis before age 65 years. Participants were followed up from 2009 to 2021. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of incident dementia.
Results
A total of 2 520 839 individuals were included (mean follow-up: 13 years), of whom 79820 (3.25%) had AF at baseline. On univariate analysis, AF was a strong predictor of dementia (HR, 3.39; P<.001). However, after multivariable adjustment, the association was modest (HR, 1.04; P<.001). AF was a stronger independent predictor in individuals aged <70 years (HR, 1.21; P<.001), whereas the association was not significant in those aged ≥70. The strongest association was observed for EOD (HR, 1.36; P<.001). All associations remained consistent in analyses restricted to individuals without prior stroke.
Conclusions
In a large Mediterranean cohort, AF was independently associated with a modest increase in dementia risk, regardless of stroke. This association was stronger in younger individuals and in EOD. These findings highlight the need for studies assessing the impact of early identification and management of AF on dementia incidence in younger populations.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La relación entre fibrilación auricular (FA) y demencia es controvertida y hay datos limitados en la población mediterránea. Se evaluó la asociación entre FA y demencia en Cataluña, intentando identificar subgrupos de mayor riesgo.
Métodos
Estudio observacional poblacional que incluyó a individuos ≥45 años sin demencia. Los datos se obtuvieron del Sistema de Información para el Desarrollo de la Investigación en Atención Primaria, que cubre más del 80% de la población catalana. La demencia se identificó mediante códigos CIE-10-MC y datos de prescripción farmacológica. Se definió como demencia de inicio temprano (DIT) aquella diagnosticada antes de los 65 años. El seguimiento fue desde 2009 hasta 2021. Los predictores de demencia se evaluaron mediante modelos de regresión de Cox.
Resultados
Se incluyó a 2.520.839 participantes (seguimiento medio de 13 años); 79.820 (3,25%) tenían FA basalmente. La FA fue predictor univariante de demencia (HR=3,39; p<0,001), pero el análisis multivariante reveló una asociación modesta (HR=1,04; p<0,001). La FA fue un predictor independiente más potente en <70 años (HR=1,21; p<0,001) y la asociación fue máxima en DIT (HR=1,36; p<0,001). En cambio, la asociación FA-demencia perdió significación en ≥70 años. Los resultados fueron similares censurando por ictus.
Conclusiones
En una gran cohorte mediterránea, la FA se asoció de forma independiente con un aumento moderado del riesgo de demencia, independientemente del ictus. Esta asociación fue más fuerte en individuos más jóvenes y en DIT. Estos hallazgos subrayan la necesidad de realizar estudios que evalúen el impacto de la identificación y el tratamiento precoz de la FA en la incidencia de la demencia en pacientes jóvenes.}

abstract = {Bulk oxide polishing occupies a substantial portion of time to achieve surface planarization in semiconductor manufacturing. Recently, thermal management has emerged as a critical issue in the polishing process. Fundamental research on thermal effects in oxide film polishing is essential for optimizing both the thermal management system and the polishing process itself. Experiments indicate that friction force, significantly influenced by wafer and retainer ring pressures as well as slurry species, plays a major role in determining polishing temperature, more so than slurry flow rate. An important finding is the temperature-dependent behavior of slurry particles, which generally reduce in size and concentrate more at higher temperatures, with aggregation starting at around 80 °C. High-temperature slurry deteriorated pad properties but enhance oxide film surface hydrolyzation. During a 60-s polishing process, the slurry temperature exhibited the maximum removal rate at 60 °C for fumed silica polishing, while for calcined ceria, the highest removal rate was observed at 20 °C. Pad B at ambient temperature, having similar hardness to Pad A at 60 °C, reduced the oxide film removal rate by 31.82 % for fumed silica and 40.94 % for calcined ceria. This indicates that pad hardness has a more pronounced effect on polishing with calcined ceria slurry.}

abstract = {Background
Advance care planning (ACP) is potentially helpful for older adults, however, the rate of uptake in community aged care settings is low. Previous pilot studies suggest that holistic, person-centered ACP approaches may be effective for older adults who experience functional impairment but do not necessarily have life-limiting conditions with clear prognoses. This paper describes the protocol of a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of combined life story work and facilitated ACP in promoting ACP engagement among older adults receiving community aged care services.
Methods
The Enhanced Advance care planning and life Review Longitudinal Intervention (EARLI) trial is an open-label, cross-over, cluster randomized controlled trial with 12 participating aged care organizations in New South Wales and Western Australia. Participants are aged 65 years or older, receiving home care services and capable of providing informed consent at initial recruitment. Recruitment occurs across a two-year period, with study sites randomized to receive the four-session intervention in the first or second year (or a single session ‘active control’ condition). Primary outcomes are participant-reported ACP engagement and ACP documentation in the aged care client record 12 weeks post-recruitment. Secondary outcomes include measures of decisional conflict, anxiety and depression, meaning-based coping and relationship quality. Analysis will take an intention-to-treat approach.
Conclusion
This trial tests a novel method of reaching older adults using a holistic, person-centered approach to promoting ACP engagement. Enhancing ACP engagement may reduce decisional conflict, minimize hospital admissions and improve outcomes for people and their families. ANZCTR Trial Registration ID: ACTRN12622001399785.}

abstract = {Background
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of independent diagnosis offers a promising solution for optimizing medical resource allocation, especially as their diagnostic accuracy can exceed that of some primary medical staff. However, despite these advancements, many patients exhibit hesitancy toward accepting AI technology, particularly for autonomous diagnostic roles. The mechanisms through which the information quality presented by AI doctors influences patients’ intention to adopt them for independent diagnosis remain unclear.
Objective
This study aimed to examine how the information quality of AI doctors influences patients’ intentions to adopt them for independent diagnosis. Specifically, drawing on the elaboration likelihood model, this study seeks to understand how diagnostic transparency (DT) and diagnostic argument quality (DAQ; as aspects of AI-delivered information) affect patients’ intention to adopt artificial intelligence doctors for independent diagnosis (IAID), with these effects being mediated by perceived expertise (PE) and cognitive trust (CT).
Methods
A scenario-based experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of information quality on patients’ adoption intentions. To test the hypotheses, a 2 (DT: low or high)×2 (DAQ: low or high) between-groups experimental design was used. Each experimental group consisted of 60 valid participants, yielding a total of 240 valid responses. Data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA and partial least squares.
Results
Both DT (β=.157; P=.008) and DAQ (β=.444; P<.001) significantly positively affected patients’ PE. As the central route, the influence of the experimental manipulation of DAQ (mean1 4.55, SD 1.40; mean2 5.68, SD 0.81; F1,236=59.701; P<.001; ηp2=0.202) on PE is more significant than that of DT (mean1 4.92, SD 1.24; mean2 5.31, SD 1.28; F1,236=7.303; P=.007; ηp2=0.030). At the same time, PE has a positive impact on CT (β=.845; P<.001), and CT also positively affected patients’ IAID (β=.679; P<.001). The serial mediation pathway via PE and CT fully mediated the effects of both DT (β=.090; 95% CI 0.017‐0.166) and DAQ (β=.254; 95% CI 0.193‐0.316) on patients’ IAID.
Conclusions
DAQ (central cue) and DT (peripheral cue) influenced patients’ IAID. These effects were fully mediated through a sequential pathway: both cues enhanced PE—with DAQ exerting a significantly stronger effect than DT—which in turn fostered CT, subsequently shaping IAID. Practically, these results highlight that to foster patient adoption, efforts should prioritize enhancing the quality and clarity of AI’s diagnostic arguments, as this pathway more strongly builds PE and, subsequently, CT. This insight is crucial for designing AI doctors that patients will find acceptable and trustworthy for various diagnostic responsibilities.}

keywords = {virtual reality, infection control, learning motivation, learning attitudes, nursing education},
abstract = {Background
Virtual reality simulation (VRS) teaching offers nursing students a safe, immersive learning environment with immediate feedback, enhancing learning outcomes. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing students had limited training and opportunities to care for patients in isolation units with infectious diseases. However, the pandemic highlighted the ongoing global priority of providing care for patients with infectious diseases.
Objective
This study aims to (1) examine the effectiveness of VRS in preparing nursing students to care for patients with infectious diseases by assessing its impact on their theoretical knowledge, learning motivation, and attitudes; and (2) evaluate their experiences with VRS.
Methods
This 2-phased mixed methods study recruited third-year undergraduate nursing students enrolled in the Integrated Emergency and Critical Care course at a university in Taiwan. Phase 1 used a quasi-experimental design to address objective 1 by comparing the learning outcomes of students in the VRS teaching program (experimental group) with those in the traditional teaching program (control group). Tools included an infection control written test, the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey, and a learning attitude questionnaire. The experimental group participated in a VRS lesson titled “Caring for a Patient with COVID-19 in the Negative Pressure Unit” as part of the infection control unit. In phase 2, semistructured interviews were conducted to address objective 2, exploring students’ learning experiences.
Results
A total of 107 students participated in phase 1, and 18 students participated in phase 2. Both the VRS and control groups showed significant improvements in theoretical knowledge scores (for the VRS group t46=–7.47; P<.001, for the control group t59=–4.04; P<.001). However, compared with the control group, the VRS group achieved significantly higher theoretical knowledge scores (t98.13=2.70; P=.008) and greater learning attention (t105=2.30; P=.02) at T1. Additionally, the VRS group demonstrated a statistically significant higher regression coefficient for learning confidence compared with the control group (β=.29; P=.03). The students’ learning experiences in the VRS group were categorized into 4 themes: Applying Professional Knowledge to Patient Care, Enhancing Infection Control Skills, Demonstrating Patient Care Confidence, and Engaging in Real Clinical Cases. The core theme identified was Strengthening Clinical Patient Care Competencies.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that VRS teaching significantly enhanced undergraduate nursing students’ infection control knowledge, learning attention, and confidence. Qualitative insights reinforced the quantitative results, highlighting the holistic benefits of VRS teaching in nursing education, including improved learning outcomes. The positive impact on student motivation and attitudes indicates a potentially transformative approach to nursing education, particularly in the post–COVID-19 era, where digital and remote learning tools play an increasingly vital role.}

abstract = {The main drawback of traditional ecological models is the inability to model local interactions between individuals. As a consequence, it was impossible to mathematically model individual-based mechanisms of direct and indirect competition, which hampers the understanding of ecological dynamics. To overcome this problem, we developed a fully transparent mechanistic analog of the classical Lotka-Volterra phenomenological model based on explicitly explainable artificial intelligence (AI) of the glass-box type. In this paper, on an individual-based model, we present (i) a rigorous mechanism of inverted competitive exclusion where, all else being equal, the weaker species in direct competition defeats the stronger species through indirect exploitative competition and (ii) a rigorous mechanism of coexistence of complete competitors resulting from a combination of accounting for microhabitat regeneration, moderate reproduction, a certain habitat size and boundary conditions. Both presented mechanisms go beyond the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, as in our model two species with different competitiveness compete for a single limiting resource in one homogeneous bounded ecosystem. We have shown that individual-based modeling of direct and indirect competition mechanisms allows for a more detailed understanding of the causal mechanisms of interspecific competition. Such understanding is necessary to refine formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, to search for mechanisms of competitive coexistence, to predict ecosystem behavior, and to develop conservation strategies. Our approach allows us to study discrete systems with fundamentally discrete mathematics, which opens up new opportunities for achieving accuracy, clarity, rigor, and explainability in studies of complex systems.}

Industrial computed laminography (ICL) can non-destructively reconstruct the internal morphology of cermet turbine discs. However, the system hardware limitation and the turbine disc structure lead to low quality and resolution of laminographic images. Therefore, ICL system devices were developed, and a super-resolution reconstruction SR-iResASPP network was proposed to reconstruct high-quality super-resolution laminographic images of the turbine disc. First, a high-strength low-absorption loading device and a multi-degree-of-freedom turntable were developed to perform high-quality imaging from the hardware level. On this basis, an SR-iResASPP network was proposed to perform super-resolution reconstruction of turbine disc laminographic images. The proposed network was studied at different magnifications and compared with other super-resolution reconstruction networks. Quantitative analyses show the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 2x super-resolution reconstruction is 31.4212 dB, the information-weighted structural similarity (IW-SSIM) is 0.9544, and the normalized mean absolute distance (NMAD) is 0.1275, which are better than other comparison methods. With the increase of magnification, the PSNR and IW-SSIM decrease, and the NMAD increases to an extent, but image details remain. The improved ICL system and SR-iResASPP network support the high-quality super-resolution morphological reconstruction of new-generation aero-engine core components.}

abstract = {Background
Providing ongoing support to the increasing number of caregivers as their needs change in the long-term course of dementia is a severe challenge to any health care system. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) operating 24/7 may help to tackle this problem.
Objective
This study describes the development of a generative AI chatbot—the PDC30 Chatbot—and evaluates its acceptability in a mixed methods study.
Methods
The PDC30 Chatbot was developed using the GPT-4o large language model, with a personality agent to constrain its behavior to provide advice on dementia caregiving based on the Positive Dementia Caregiving in 30 Days Guidebook—a laypeople’s resource based on a validated training manual for dementia caregivers. The PDC30 Chatbot’s responses to 21 common questions were compared with those of ChatGPT and another chatbot (called Chatbot-B) as standards of reference. Chatbot-B was constructed using PDC30 Chatbot’s architecture but replaced the latter’s knowledge base with a collection of authoritative sources, including the World Health Organization’s iSupport, By Us For Us Guides, and 185 web pages or manuals by Alzheimer’s Association, National Institute on Aging, and UK Alzheimer’s Society. In the next phase, to assess the acceptability of the PDC30 Chatbot, 21 family caregivers used the PDC30 Chatbot for two weeks and provided ratings and comments on its acceptability.
Results
Among the three chatbots, ChatGPT’s responses tended to be repetitive and not specific enough. PDC30 Chatbot and Chatbot-B, by virtue of their design, produced highly context-sensitive advice, with the former performing slightly better when the questions conveyed significant psychological distress on the part of the caregiver. In the acceptability study, caregivers found the PDC30 Chatbot highly user-friendly, and its responses quite helpful and easy to understand. They were rather satisfied with it and would strongly recommend it to other caregivers. During the 2-week trial period, the majority used the chatbot more than once per day. Thematic analysis of their written feedback revealed three major themes: helpfulness, accessibility, and improved attitude toward AI.
Conclusions
The PDC30 Chatbot provides quality responses to caregiver questions, which are well-received by caregivers. Conversational AI is a viable approach to improve the support of caregivers.}

In recent years, the large amount of available financial data and the heterogeneous contextual information led researchers to investigate data-driven models using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches for forecasting stock prices. Recent methodologies focus mainly on analyzing participants from Reddit without considering other social media and how their combination affects the stock market, which remains an open challenge. In this paper, we combine financial data and textual user-generated information, which are provided as input to various deep learning models, to develop a stock forecasting system. The main novelties of the proposal concern the design of a multi-modal approach combining historical stock prices and sentiment scores extracted by different Online Social Networks (OSNs), also unveiling possible correlations about heterogeneous information evaluated during the GameStop squeeze. In particular, we have examined several AI-based models and investigated the impact of textual data inferred from well-known Online Social Networks (i.e., Reddit and Twitter) on stock market behavior by conducting a case study on GameStop. Although users’ dynamic opinions on social networks may have a detrimental impact on the stock prediction task, our investigation has demonstrated the usefulness of assessing user-generated content inferred from various OSNs on the market forecasting problem.}

Depression affects 32% of older adults. Loneliness and social isolation are common risk factors for depression in older adults. Mobile apps can connect users and are also effective in depression management in the general population. However, older adults have specific needs in terms of the content of depression self-care interventions and their accessibility. It remains unknown whether existing apps for depression self-care are applicable to older adults.
Objective
The initial aim of this assessment was to systematically identify interactive depression self-care apps specifically designed for older adults. As we did not find any, we assessed the applicability of existing depression self-care apps to the needs of older adult users.
Methods
Using an established app assessment methodology, we searched for Android and iOS interactive mental health apps providing self-care for depression in English and Chinese in the 42Matters database, Chinese Android app stores, and the first 10 pages of Google and Baidu. We developed an assessment rubric based on extensive revision of the literature. The rubric consisted of the following sections: general characteristics of the apps (eg, developer, platform, and category), app content (eg, epidemiology and risk factors of depression in older adults, techniques to improve mood and well-being), and technical aspects (eg, accessibility, privacy and confidentiality, and engagement).
Results
We identified 23 apps (n=19, 82.6%, English and n=4, 17.4%, Chinese apps), with 5 (21.7%) iOS-only apps, 3 (13%) Android-only apps, and 15 (65.2%) apps on both platforms. None specifically targeted older adults with depression. All apps were designed by commercial companies and were free to download. Most of the apps incorporated cognitive behavior therapy, mood monitoring, or journaling. All but 3 (13%) apps had a privacy and confidentiality policy. In addition, 14 (60.9%) apps covered depression risk factors in older adults, and 3 (13%) apps delivered information about depression epidemiology in older adults via a chatbot. Furthermore, 17 (73.9%) apps mentioned other topics relevant to older adults, such as pain management, grief, loneliness, and social isolation. Around 30% (n=7) of the apps were supported by an online forum. Common accessibility issues included a lack of adaptations for users with visual or hearing impairments and incompatibility with larger font sizes in the phone settings.
Conclusions
There are no depression apps developed specifically for older adults. Available mobile apps have limited applicability to older adults in terms of their clinical and technical features. Depression self-care apps should aim to incorporate content relevant to older adults, such as grief and loss; include online communities; and improve accessibility to adapt to potential health impairments in older adults.}

abstract = {Background
The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus, heavily impacted Taiwan’s health care system, triggering clinical crises and lasting effects among affected individuals and families. The first case in Taiwan was identified on February 25, 2003, and the final case was reported on June 15, 2003. During the epidemic, 346 people were diagnosed with SARS, leading to 37 deaths. Outbreaks also occurred in China, Singapore, and Toronto (Canada), showing the vulnerability of global health systems to new zoonotic diseases. Clinically, SARS causes high fever and severe lung inflammation. Survivors often had long-term lung problems, including fibrosis, and bone issues like osteonecrosis, mostly due to high-dose steroid treatment. Although studies have looked at long-term outcomes—especially lung and bone issues—none followed patients beyond 7 years. The COVID-19 pandemic further revealed gaps in understanding how serious viral infections affect wider health areas, including unintentional and intentional injuries. Data on related hospitalizations also remain limited.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the long-term risk of both unintentional and intentional injuries among survivors of SARS and their relatives, using a nationwide population-based cohort.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, focused on 285 individuals diagnosed with SARS in 2003 and 699 of their relatives, matched in a 1:10 ratio with controls. Injury risks were assessed using Fine and Gray’s competing risk models, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates, over a follow-up period of up to 15 years.
Results
Survivors of SARS exhibited a significant increase in the risk of accidental injuries, with an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of 1.631 (95% CI 1.184-2.011; P<.001), indicating persistent physiological vulnerabilities postinfection. Family members of survivors of SARS also had elevated injury risk (AHR 1.572, 95% CI 1.148-1.927; P<.001), possibly due to stress and caregiving burdens. Subgroup analysis showed increased risks for poisoning (AHR 2.701, 95% CI 1.956-4.084; P<.001) and falls (AHR 1.524, 95% CI 1.102-1.878; P=.003) among survivors. Relatives faced higher risks for traffic incidents (AHR 2.003, 95% CI 1.462-2.459), poisoning (AHR 1.531, 95% CI 1.120-1.886), medical incidents, falls (AHR 1.802, 95% CI 1.324-2.214), and crushing injuries (AHR 2.469, 95% CI 1.803-3.026; all P<.001). These findings highlight the need for targeted preventive measures to address long-term health risks in both survivors of SARS and their families.
Conclusions
Survivors of SARS and their relatives face increased injury risks, highlighting long-term physical and psychosocial vulnerabilities after severe infectious outbreaks. These findings suggest that health care systems should provide preventive and supportive measures to mitigate long-term impacts for those affected by pandemics.}

abstract = {Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) promise help for democratic deliberation, such as processing information, moderating discussion, and fact-checking. But public views of AI's role remain underexplored. Given widespread skepticism, integrating AI into deliberative formats may lower trust and willingness to participate. We report a preregistered within-subjects survey experiment with a representative German sample (n = 1850) testing how information about AI-facilitated deliberation affects willingness to participate and expected quality. Respondents were randomly assigned to descriptions of identical deliberative tasks facilitated by either AI or humans, enabling causal identification of information effects. Results show a clear AI penalty: participants were less willing to engage in AI-facilitated deliberation and anticipated lower deliberative quality than for human-facilitated formats. The penalty shrank among respondents who perceived greater societal benefits of AI or tended to anthropomorphize it, but grew with higher assessments of AI risk. These findings indicate that AI-facilitated deliberation currently faces substantial public skepticism and may create a new “deliberative divide.” Unlike traditional participation gaps linked to education or demographics, this divide reflects attitudes toward AI. Efforts to realize AI's affordances should directly address these perceptions to offset the penalty and avoid discouraging participation or exacerbating participatory inequalities.}

This work aims to investigate kinetics behaviors from the perspective of enzymatic reaction mechanism. The influences of the CA concentration, type of tertiary amines, pH, and temperature on the reaction rate between CO2 and tertiary amine (ν) and catalytic activity of CA (φ) were first investigated in a stopped-flow device. Adding 50 g∙m⁻³ CA enhanced ν in tertiary amine solutions by a factor ranging from 22 to 42 at 298 K and pH=9.5, demonstrating its excellent catalytic performance. The ν increased with increasing CA concentration, pH, temperature, and tertiary amine's pKa. φ increased with the increase of CA concentration, as well as the decrease of temperature, pH, and tertiary amine's pKa. Proteomics analysis further revealed that conformational changes of the CA's secondary structure induced by high pH and temperature altered the expressions of the local active-site region and deactivated CA, ultimately leading to a decrease in φ. Additionally, the CA-catalysis kinetics equation accorded with the Michaelis-Menten model, with catalytic second-order rate constants on the magnitude of 107. Overall, this work provides a guideline for its industrial application in the CO2 capture process.}

Because of being limited by the known and inherent features, KE can only generate a limited number of new modeling without providing a rich source of creativity. To get rid of the shackles of inherent characteristics, KE and Association Creative Thinking Method (ACTM) are combined in this paper to stimulate the bionic design creativity. The creativity of bionic design comes from the association of highly ordered Kansei vocabulary, and the product form derived from this can significantly enhance emotional value and user satisfaction. The electronic scale is taken as an example and the research is divided into three stages. Firstly, samples and Kansei words are widely selected; the priority order of each Kansei word is obtained after continuous fuzzy Kano model analysis. Secondly, after morphological analysis deconstructs product features, support vector regression establishes an engineering model between the highest-ranking Kansei words and products’ form features so as to generate the optimal product design. Finally, after six operational steps of ACTM, a series of biologically inspired creative designs are obtained. The research results found that: 1. Customers ranked their Kansei needs for electronic scales in order of cute, fashionable, and elegant. 2. The circular appearance, square screen, U-shaped mechanical key and other styling components can easily trigger customers’ cute emotional needs. 3. The biomimetic design of fish tail, cat paw, and octopus style meets the Kansei needs of customers and provides parameter guidance for manufacturers. Compared to traditional KE, which only obtains the optimal design combination for morphological analysis table, combining ACTM’s biomimetic inspired design makes creative shapes more vivid and interesting, improving market sales and the success rate of new product development.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
The optimal antithrombotic therapy (AT) after left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is debated. We assessed the impact of intensive vs nonintensive AT on the incidence of device-related thrombus (DRT) based on whether the device implantation was classified as optimal or suboptimal.
Methods
This study included patients who underwent successful LAAC in 9 centers. Patients were classified according to the quality of device implantation: optimal (proximal implant without ≥3mm peridevice leak) or suboptimal (distal implant and/or ≥3mm peridevice leak). Postimplant AT was classified as either intensive (dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, or a combination of both) or nonintensive (no AT or a single antiplatelet therapy). The primary endpoint was the incidence of DRT between the 6th and 12th weeks postprocedure.
Results
A total of 1225 patients underwent LAAC, with 757 (61.8%) achieving optimal device implantation and 468 (38.2%) classified as suboptimal. After a median follow-up of 20 months, the incidence of DRT in the optimal implant group was 2.6% with intensive AT and 3.7% with nonintensive AT (P=.38). In the suboptimal implant group, the incidence of DRT increased to 11.2% with intensive AT and 15.5% with nonintensive AT (P=.19). On multivariate analysis, suboptimal implantation (HR, 4.51; 95%CI, 2.70-7.54, P<.001) but not intensive AT (HR, 0,66; 95%CI, 0.40-1.07, P=.09) emerged as an independent predictor of DRT.
Conclusions
The incidence of DRT after LAAC was higher in patients with suboptimal device implantation. In patients with optimal implantation, the incidence of DRT was low and similar between nonintensive and intensive AT strategies. Large, randomized trials are warranted to confirm these results.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
El tratamiento antitrombótico (TA) óptimo tras el cierre de la orejuela izquierda (COI) es objeto de debate. Se evaluó el impacto de los TA intensivo y no intensivo en la incidencia de trombosis relacionada con el dispositivo (TD) según el implante fuera óptimo o subóptimo.
Métodos
El estudio incluyó a pacientes que se sometieron a un COI exitoso en 9 centros. Se clasificó a los pacientes según el implante del dispositivo fuera óptimo (implante proximal sin fuga peridispositivo ≥3mm) o subóptimo (implante distal y/o fuga ≥3mm) y el TA, intensivo (doble antiagregación plaquetaria, anticoagulación o una combinación de ambas) o no intensivo (sin TA o antiagregación plaquetaria simple) tras el implante. El objetivo primario fue la incidencia de TD entre las semanas 6 y 12 tras el procedimiento.
Resultados
Un total de 1.225 pacientes se sometieron a COI. Se lograron implantes óptimo y subóptimo del dispositivo en 757 (61,8%) y 468 (38,2%) de ellos. Tras un seguimiento de 20 meses, los pacientes con implante óptimo y TA intensivo o no intensivo presentaron una incidencia de TD del 2,6 y el 3,7% (p=0,38). En aquellos con un implante subóptimo, la incidencia de TD aumentó al 11,2% con TA intensivo y el 15,5% con TA no intensivo (p=0,19). En el análisis multivariable, el implante subóptimo (HR=4,51; IC95%, 2,70-7,54; p <0,001), pero no el TA intensivo (HR=0,66; IC95%, 0,40-1,07; p=0,09), se identificó como un predictor independiente de TD.
Conclusiones
La incidencia de TD tras el COI fue mayor en pacientes con implante subóptimo del dispositivo. En el grupo de implante óptimo, la incidencia de TD fue baja y similar entre TA no intensivo y TA intensivo. Se requieren ensayos clínicos grandes y aleatorizados para confirmar estos resultados.}

This type of exit can arise due to a variety of reasons, including life situations, strategic reasons, or other interests. The process of selling a small, privately held company, oftentimes facilitated by business intermediaries, typically begins with introducing the company to potential acquirers through confidential marketing that provides just enough information to pique interest while also preserving the anonymity of the entrepreneur or business. One important element included in the marketing of a business is the entrepreneur's reason to sell. Due to the potential information asymmetry present in the sale of privately-held businesses, this study proposes that the reason for sale, referred to in this study as the communicated exit purpose, sends varying signals to potential acquirers impacting the perception of the business opportunity and acquisition price at exit. Utilizing an archival dataset from a popular business-for-sale website, our analysis shows support that the price at exit is affected by the communicated entrepreneur's reason for exit. A separate experiment and qualitative study provide further insight into the acquirer perceptions of the business opportunity based on the stated reason of entrepreneurial exit. Our paper concludes with strategies to assist entrepreneurs regarding the disclosure of reasons for exiting.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical reasoning (CR) is an essential skill; yet, physicians often receive limited feedback. Artificial intelligence holds promise to fill this gap.
Objective
We report the development of named entity recognition (NER), logic-based and large language model (LLM)–based assessments of CR documentation in the electronic health record across 2 institutions (New York University Grossman School of Medicine [NYU] and University of Cincinnati College of Medicine [UC]).
Methods
The note corpus consisted of internal medicine resident admission notes (retrospective set: July 2020-December 2021, n=700 NYU and 450 UC notes and prospective validation set: July 2023-December 2023, n=155 NYU and 92 UC notes). Clinicians rated CR documentation quality in each note using a previously validated tool (Revised-IDEA), on 3-point scales across 2 domains: differential diagnosis (D0, D1, and D2) and explanation of reasoning, (EA0, EA1, and EA2). At NYU, the retrospective set was annotated for NER for 5 entities (diagnosis, diagnostic category, prioritization of diagnosis language, data, and linkage terms). Models were developed using different artificial intelligence approaches, including NER, logic-based model: a large word vector model (scispaCy en_core_sci_lg) with model weights adjusted with backpropagation from annotations, developed at NYU with external validation at UC, NYUTron LLM: an NYU internal 110 million parameter LLM pretrained on 7.25 million clinical notes, only validated at NYU, and GatorTron LLM: an open source 345 million parameter LLM pretrained on 82 billion words of clinical text, fined tuned on NYU retrospective sets, then externally validated and further fine-tuned at UC. Model performance was assessed in the prospective sets with F1-scores for the NER, logic-based model and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for the LLMs.
Results
At NYU, the NYUTron LLM performed best: the D0 and D2 models had AUROC/AUPRC 0.87/0.79 and 0.89/0.86, respectively. The D1, EA0, and EA1 models had insufficient performance for implementation (AUROC range 0.57-0.80, AUPRC range 0.33-0.63). For the D1 classification, the approach pivoted to a stepwise approach taking advantage of the more performant D0 and D2 models. For the EA model, the approach pivoted to a binary EA2 model (ie, EA2 vs not EA2) with excellent performance, AUROC/AUPRC 0.85/ 0.80. At UC, the NER, D-logic–based model was the best performing D model (F1-scores 0.80, 0.74, and 0.80 for D0, D1, D2, respectively. The GatorTron LLM performed best for EA2 scores AUROC/AUPRC 0.75/ 0.69.
Conclusions
This is the first multi-institutional study to apply LLMs for assessing CR documentation in the electronic health record. Such tools can enhance feedback on CR. Lessons learned by implementing these models at distinct institutions support the generalizability of this approach.}

Optimized disease detection methods enhance efficiency, sustainability and economic viability, making non-destructive health assessment vital for modern agricultural practices. This study aims to differentiate grapevine varieties based on their spectral characteristics using multispectral imaging. Focusing on grapevine canopies within a vineyard in the Attica region of Greece, this research proposes a methodology for aerial multispectral images exploitation captured over two consecutive years, namely 2022 and 2023. Unlike typical vineyards with limited grape varieties, the study area included over 70 varieties, each with relatively small sample sizes. Classification algorithms were employed to separate vines from soil and shadows, with the Maximum Likelihood algorithm achieving 98.79% and 90.53% accuracy for the 2022 and 2023 images, respectively. Vegetation indices were applied to assess vine health, chlorophyll content and canopy density. Among seven indices, the Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (CVI) and Vegetation Ratio Index (RVI) were selected due to their low correlation. Six clustering algorithms were tested, with the Bisecting K-means algorithm proving the most effective, achieving a silhouette value of 0.41. Comparative analysis between the 2022 and 2023 clusters revealed that 34 vine varieties maintained stable health, 24 improved and 15 worsened. This study underscores the potential of multispectral imaging and clustering algorithms in vineyard management, offering insights to optimize cultivation practices based on spectral data.}

The built environment is increasingly recognized as a significant factor in promoting physical fitness (PF). However, there is a lack of research examining the relationship between the built environment and PF, and this study aims to address this gap.
Methods
The study utilizes data from the Children's Growth Environment, Lifestyle, Physical, and Mental Health Development Project (COHERENCE) in Guangzhou, China. This project collects annual data on PF and demographic information of primary and high school students from 2016/17 to 2019/20 academic year. The built environment data around participants' residential neighborhoods is obtained based on the 5Ds framework.
Results
Among the 96,402 participants, aged 8.66 (1.88) years old, 51,363 (53.3%) were boys. The fitted restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve revealed a reverse N-shaped relationship between population density and PF. Threshold analysis discovered that when the distance from the residential address to the nearest public transport station was not more than 470 m, a longer distance was associated with better PF [β (Unstandardized coefficient) = 0.764, 95%CI (Confidence Interval) = 0.297, 1.230].
Conclusions
This large population-based study suggests that there is an urgent need for community-scale policies related to built environment in order to enhance the PF of Chinese children and adolescents.}

abstract = {Background
Telemedicine offers a multitude of potential advantages, such as enhanced health care accessibility, cost reduction, and improved patient outcomes. The significance of telemedicine has been underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic, as it plays a crucial role in maintaining uninterrupted care while minimizing the risk of viral exposure. However, the adoption and implementation of telemedicine have been relatively sluggish in certain areas. Assessing the level of interest in telemedicine can provide valuable insights into areas that require enhancement.
Objective
The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the level of public and research interest in telemedicine from 2017 to 2022 and also consider any potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Google Trends data were retrieved using the search topics “telemedicine” or “e-health” to assess public interest, geographic distribution, and trends through a joinpoint regression analysis. Bibliographic data from Scopus were used to chart publications referencing the terms “telemedicine” or “eHealth” (in the title, abstract, and keywords) in terms of scientific production, key countries, and prominent keywords, as well as collaboration and co-occurrence networks.
Results
Worldwide, telemedicine generated higher mean public interest (relative search volume=26.3%) compared to eHealth (relative search volume=17.6%). Interest in telemedicine remained stable until January 2020, experienced a sudden surge (monthly percent change=95.7%) peaking in April 2020, followed by a decline (monthly percent change=–22.7%) until August 2020, and then returned to stability. A similar trend was noted in the public interest regarding eHealth. Chile, Australia, Canada, and the United States had the greatest public interest in telemedicine. In these countries, moderate to strong correlations were evident between Google Trends and COVID-19 data (ie, new cases, new deaths, and hospitalized patients). Examining 19,539 original medical articles in the Scopus database unveiled a substantial rise in telemedicine-related publications, showing a total increase of 201.5% from 2017 to 2022 and an average annual growth rate of 24.7%. The most significant surge occurred between 2019 and 2020. Notably, the majority of the publications originated from a single country, with 20.8% involving international coauthorships. As the most productive country, the United States led a cluster that included Canada and Australia as well. European, Asian, and Latin American countries made up the remaining 3 clusters. The co-occurrence network categorized prevalent keywords into 2 clusters, the first cluster primarily focused on applying eHealth, mobile health (mHealth), or digital health to noncommunicable or chronic diseases; the second cluster was centered around the application of telemedicine and telehealth within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
Our analysis of search and bibliographic data over time and across regions allows us to gauge the interest in this topic, offer evidence regarding potential applications, and pinpoint areas for additional research and awareness-raising initiatives.}

As it continues to evolve and integrate into various applications, this practice has raised significant privacy concerns. Current state-of-the-art facial privacy-preserving methods predominantly utilize a generative paradigm, where sensitive facial features, such as identity information or specific attributes, are extracted and subsequently sanitized. The fusion of these sanitized feature with other non- or soft-biometric attributes is executed to generate privacy-ensured synthetic faces. However, these methods always generate faces of insufficient security and low realism. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuShield, a novel facial privacy-preserving method that integrates identity and attribute hiding based on diffusion model. DiffuShield enables configurable, confidential, and practical facial privacy preservation by allowing selective preservation of identities and sensitive attributes. It adopts the diffusion model as the backbone generative network and introduces identity and attribute encoders as conditional inputs. These two encoders can efficiently decompose facial representations while incorporating differential privacy mechanisms by introducing Laplacian noise, thereby achieving flexible facial privacy preservation. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffuShield not only excels in preserving privacy but also maintains image quality and compatibility with various computer vision tasks. This balance of privacy and performance positions DiffuShield as a robust solution for real-world applications requiring both privacy preservation and functionality.}

abstract = {Bioremediation of extremely high-chloride wastewater poses significant challenges due to the adverse effects of elevated salt concentrations on most microorganisms, where chloride levels can be as high as 7% (w/v). Mangrove wetlands derived fungus, Aspergillus aculeatus, emerged as a promising candidate, capable of removing approximately 40% of chloride ions in environments with concentration of 15% (w/v), representative of industrial wastewater conditions. Transcriptomics and biochemical assays conducted under increasing salt conditions revealed that elevated chloride concentrations induce the expression and activity of S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase, which facilitates the conversion of chloride into chloromethane. This is the first report characterizing the biological mechanism behind high salt tolerance and chloride removal capacity of Aspergillus aculeatus. This salt remediation mechanism may work as a starter for developing future bioremediation strategies to treat high-chloride wastewater using fungi, offering an eco-friendly alternative to traditional physical or chemical methods.}

AI, which is a combination of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and human intelligence (HI), is revolutionizing drug discovery and development by making it more cost-effective and efficient. It is also being used in fields such as medicinal chemistry, molecular and cell biology, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, formulation development, and toxicology. AI plays a crucial role in clinical testing by enhancing patient stratification, patient sample evaluation, and trial design, assisting in the identification of biomarkers, determining efficacy criteria, dose selection, trial length, and target patient population selection. The primary objective of this study is to emphasize the importance of AI in clinical trials and drug development, while also exploring the existing challenges and potential advancements in AI within the healthcare industry. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, covering the period from 1998 to 2023. The Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant information. A variety of publications, including Research Gate, Nature, MDPI, and Springer Link, provided pertinent data. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the use of AI in clinical research and drug development, as well as its potential and limitations. We also discuss the benefits and main data limitations of the traditional trial and drug development approach. AI approaches are currently being used to overcome research obstacles and eliminate conceptual or methodological limitations. After discussing possible obstacles and coping mechanisms, we provide several recommendations to help individuals understand the challenges and difficulties associated with clinical research and drug development. It is essential for pharmaceutical companies to have a cutting-edge AI strategy if AI is to become a routine tool for clinical research and drug development.}

The present study aims to understand how support from kinship networks, particularly spousal and familial support might facilitate or act as barriers to better coping with the stress, anxiety and depression caused by infertility among women living with infertility. The study was part of a larger research project funded by the National Commission for Women, India, it included qualitative interviews with 30 infertile women, comprising 15 high scorers in at least two mental health variables (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) and 15 low scorers with minimal scores in at least two of these variables. Grounded theory was employed for data analysis and interpretation. Upon interviewing the women, it was found that important factors supporting coping in women were spousal and family support. Further it was found that these factors promoting good mental well-being did not function separately but were in conjunction with each other. We argue that kinship support is fundamental to coping with infertility in India, and that emotional support and understanding provided by partners and loved ones can be critical in enhancing and maintaining the mental well-being of women dealing with infertility.}

abstract = {Background
Synchronous oligometastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SOESCC), characterized by a limited number of metastases at diagnosis, represents a significant subset of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the optimal treatment modality for the condition has not been determined. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of local consolidative radiotherapy (cRT) for the primary tumor combined with first-line chemoimmunotherapy (CIT).
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included 102 patients with SOESCC who underwent first-line CIT, either alone or in combination with cRT, between 2018 and 2022. We analyzed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the two groups using propensity score matching (PSM). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Failure patterns were compared between groups.
Results
Patients who received the additional cRT had longer PFS (median PFS, 11.5 vs. 8.3 months, P = 0.009) than did those who received CIT only; however, no significant difference was noted in OS (median OS, 20.0 vs. 17.0 months, P = 0.410) between the two groups. These results remained consistent after PSM and multivariate Cox regression analyses (PFS: hazard ratio [HR] 0.539, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.312–0.932, P = 0.027; OS: HR 0.580, 95% CI 0.307–1.095, P = 0.093). Notably, the pattern of failure in the CIT group was primarily characterized by locoregional failure, in contrast to the distant failure observed in the CIT + cRT group. Locoregional failure-free survival in the CIT + cRT group was significantly lower than that in the CIT group (P < 0.001). Moreover, no statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events between the two groups.
Conclusions
In patients with SOESCC, the combination of local cRT and first-line CIT prolonged PFS without increasing treatment-related toxicity. In addition, cRT for primary tumor significantly reduced the incidence of locoregional failure. This synergistic approach appears to be a viable and potentially superior treatment strategy for the treatment of SOESCC.}

abstract = {Background
SIBP04 is a biosimilar of bevacizumab (Avastin®, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). This study evaluated the equivalence of SIBP04 to Avastin® as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (nsqNSCLC).
Methods
In this randomized, double-blind, multi-center, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsqNSCLC from 58 hospitals at China. Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive SIBP04 or Avastin® (15 mg/kg) combined with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and carboplatin (area under curve [AUC] = 5.0, no more than 800 mg) (PC) regimens intravenously (3-week cycles, up to six cycles) followed by SIBP04 maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), defined as the best overall response from the first dose to the 18th week, assessed by the independent review committee (IRC) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Clinical equivalence of the primary endpoint was done by comparing the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ORR ratio (SIBP04 plus PC vs. Avastin® plus PC) in the per-protocol set (PPS) populaiton with the prespecified equivalence margin of 0.75–1.33. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, disease control rate, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacological bioequivalence of steady-state trough concentrations.
Results
From April 17, 2020, to April 20, 2021, 517 patients were randomly assigned to receive SIBP04 plus PC (n = 259) or Avastin® plus PC (n = 258). The ORR of the SIBP04 plus PC group was 55.6% (95% CI, 49.3–61.8) and that of the Avastin® plus PC group was 59.3% (95% CI, 53.0–65.4) in the full analysis set (FAS) population (P = 0. 3944). The ORR of the SIBP04 plus PC group was 62.6% (95% CI, 55.8–69.0) and that of the Avastin® plus PC group was 64.7% (95% CI, 58.0–71.0) in the PPS population (P = 0.6448). The ORR ratio (SIBP04 plus PC vs. Avastin® plus PC) was 0.94 (90% CI, 0.8270–1.0621) in the FAS population and 0.97 (90% CI, 0.8578–1.0900) in the PPS population, respectively, both within the prespecified equivalence margin of 0.75–1.33. Other efficacy endpoints, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics were all comparable across the groups.
Conclusions
SIBP04 showed equivalent efficacy and safety profile to Avastin® in patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsqNSCLC. SIBP04 plus PC regimen will offer an alternative first-line treatment option for this patient population.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a multifunctional polysaccharide which has been extensively used in the food and biomedical industry. However, how HA is degraded and fermented by Bacteroides spp. has not been fully characterized. Here, we comprehensively investigated the detailed degradation profiles and fermentation characteristics of four different HAs with discrete molecular weight (Mw) by fourteen distinctive Bacteroides spp. from the human gut microbiota. Our results indicated that high-Mw HAs were more degradable and fermentable than low-Mw HAs. Interestingly, B. salyersiae showed the best degrading capability for both high-Mw and low-Mw HAs, making it a keystone species for HA degradation among Bacteroides spp.. Specifically, HA degradation by B. salyersiae produced significant amounts of unsaturated tetrasaccharide (udp4). Co-culture experiments indicated that the produced udp4 could be further fermented and utilized by non-proficient HA-degraders, suggesting a possible cross-feeding interaction in the utilization of HA within the Bacteroides spp.. Altogether, our study provides novel insights into the metabolism of HA by the human gut microbiota, which has considerable implications for the development of new HA-based nutraceuticals and medicines.}

abstract = {Background
National and international guidelines advocate for a multimodal approach to treating adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combining pharmacotherapy with psychological interventions. While recent reviews support cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a viable treatment for ADHD in adults, evidence remains limited. Another challenge is the availability of psychological interventions, with stimulants remaining the primary treatment choice for adults with ADHD. One promising approach to increasing access to psychological interventions is the dissemination of internet-delivered CBT.
Objective
This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a guided web-based stress management program specifically designed for working adults with ADHD. The intervention aimed to enhance quality of life by addressing stress, exhaustion, anxiety, and depression, commonly experienced by this population.
Methods
Thirty-six participants took part in a single-arm open trial, with assessments before, during, and after the intervention. The intervention consisted of 12 modules based on CBT principles, focusing on executive functioning, stress management, and emotion regulation, with clinician support on demand. Primary and secondary outcomes included quality of life (Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale [AAQoL]), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS-10]), exhaustion (Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale [KEDS]), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), and ADHD symptoms (the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale [ASRS]).
Results
Results indicated a statistically and clinically significant improvement in quality of life (Cohen d=0.84), and a reduction in ADHD symptoms (d=0.98), as well as statistically significant reductions in perceived stress (d=0.83), exhaustion (d=1.12), anxiety (d=1.70), and depression (d=1.25). Improvements were sustained at a 12-week follow-up. A clinically significant improvement in quality of life was observed in 36% (13/36) of participants. Participants reported high satisfaction with the program and the guidance. Adherence was high, with an overall assessment response rate of 84%, a mean of 78% of modules opened, and no explicit dropouts. Twelve of the 36 participants reported negative effects. Qualitative content analysis of participants’ written feedback revealed positive experiences and suggestions for improvement.
Conclusions
This study suggests promise for web-delivered interventions tailored to the needs of adults with ADHD, pending further research and development in controlled studies.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in semantic understanding and task planning, their limited geospatial domain knowledge still hinders their efficiency in geospatial modeling. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate geospatial knowledge with the inherent semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs, enabling their effective application in specialized geospatial domains. In this study, we introduce GeoGraphRAG, a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach tailored for geospatial modeling. Specifically, GeoGraphRAG utilizes LLMs as intelligent agents to identify user demands, retrieve relevant subgraphs from external graph knowledge base, and injects both structural and semantic information into the LLM. Through the graph-driven solution planning phase, GeoGraphRAG automatically generates modeling solutions and geospatial code in response to specific user demands. The proposed method is evaluated against different baseline approaches across various LLMs based on the benchmark dataset designed for geospatial modeling, and a representative application scenario is presented to illustrate its practical effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the injection of graph-structured knowledge improves both the efficiency and interpretability of LLM-based geospatial modeling, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach. GeoGraphRAG represents the first attempt to introduce graph-based RAG into geospatial modeling and provides novel insights for future research and practical applications in this field.}

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic, progressive condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. In addition to the daily challenges that HF poses, acute exacerbations can lead to costly hospitalizations and increased mortality. High health care costs and the burden of HF have led to the emerging application of new technologies to support people living with HF to stay well while living in the community. However, many digital solutions have not involved consumers and health care professionals in their design, leading to poor adoption. The SmartHeart project aimed to codevelop a smart health ecosystem to support the early detection of HF deterioration and encourage self-care, potentially preventing hospitalizations.
Objective
This study aims to provide an overview of the SmartHeart project by describing our approach to designing the SmartHeart system, outlining its features, and describing the planned pilot study to determine the feasibility of the system.
Methods
We used the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework to guide the development of the SmartHeart system, involving users (people with HF and their caregivers) and stakeholders (health care providers involved in the management of HF) in its design. SmartHeart is a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system. It includes 2 user interfaces for patients: an Amazon Alexa conversational agent and a smartphone app. The system collects physiological, symptom, and behavioral data through wireless sensors and self-reports from users. These data are processed and analyzed to provide personalized health insights, self-care support, and alerts in case of health deterioration. The system also includes a web-based user interface for health care professionals, allowing them to access data, send messages to users, and receive notifications about potential health deterioration. A single-arm, multicenter pilot trial (N=20) is planned to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SmartHeart before evaluation through a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome will be a description of the study's feasibility (recruitment, attrition, engagement, and changes in self-care).
Results
The SmartHeart study started in January 2021 on procurement of funding. Recruitment for the pilot trial started in August 2024 and will be completed by March 2025. We have currently enrolled 12 participants. Follow-up of all participants will be completed by the end of May 2025.
Conclusions
We have co-designed and developed a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system for the early detection of HF deterioration and prevention of HF-related hospitalizations. The next step is a pilot study, which will provide valuable information on feasibility and preliminary effects to inform a larger evaluation trial. SmartHeart has the potential to augment existing health services and help people with HF stay well while living in the community.

In case of intangible assets related to the new economy and Internet companies, valuation is usually much more complicated due to rapid volatility, limited historical information and constantly emerging new technologies that change the image of the market. The same situation is in case of young companies, which current, tangible assets are of little value, while the value of the company is concentrated in intangible assets and development options The paper presents general valuation indicators for Internet companies, which are a root point for a client division allowing a further model improvement. Based on the Internet companies evaluation indicators review, authors decided that for this proposal, the division between one-time (non-loyal) and repetitive (loyal) customers is of the greatest use. Following, the method of valuing companies based on valuation of Customer Lifetime Value was described. Considering different kinds of the Internet clients, a valuation model for one time and continuous relation was proposed. Authors suggest modifying traditional model by dividing the customers into two segments. The consumer's loyalty measured by behavioral outcome - the frequency of purchase is the criteria of segmentation. Such segmentation allows better extrapolation of company's value.}

abstract = {With the sustainability transition actively underway in society, there is a strong impetus for higher education institutions to provide suitable learning opportunities for their students. Chemical engineers are especially well-positioned to contribute to many sustainability efforts, building upon their domain knowledge and skillset. The effective integration of sustainability into a chemical engineer's education journey requires holistic consideration at the programme level to ensure that students graduate with the right technical and professional skills. This article aims to outline current practices at the Department of Chemical Engineering, at a London-based, research-intensive institution, and share our current thinking on the next steps. We hope to foster a conversation among chemical engineering educators worldwide about the best way forward in teaching sustainability.}

abstract = {A rapid increase in plastic pollution is a major threat to the environment. One intriguing group of enzymes that can act as biocatalysts for the breakdown of polymers is lipase. This study reports the production of lipase from Aspergillus niger MG654699.1 utilizing agro-industrial residue (wheat bran) through solid-state fermentation. The produced lipase showed 176.55 U/mL of activity, 7.18 mg/mL of protein content, and 24.60 U/mg of specific activity under the optimal conditions of 37°C and pH 7.0. The biocatalytic activity of 30 KDa lipase resulted in 3.8%, 3.6%, and 5% weight loss of PE (polyethylene), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), and PS (polystyrene), respectively. Application of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the lipase-mediated deterioration of treated polymer samples. The alterations in functional groups and surface structures of the samples showed the chemical and physical impact of the applied enzyme. The findings of this study showed that lipase can be employed as an eco-friendly and green biocatalyst for effective depolymerization and deterioration of environmental plastic waste.}

abstract = {Objectives
To determine whether the regular consumption of milk free from A1 β-casein (A1PF milk) improves cognitive performance to a greater extent than conventional milk, and if so, whether such improvements are associated with an increase in the serum titres of reduced glutathione (GSH).
Design
A multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms, conducted from 7 March 2023 to 13 October 2023.
Setting
Two hospitals in Tianjin, China.
Participants
Volunteers (N = 96) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and aged between 65 and 75 years.
Intervention
A1PF skim milk powder or conventional skim milk powder, diluted into liquid form (200 mL) and consumed twice daily for 90 days.
Measurements
The primary outcomes were cognitive performance (assessed with the Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test [SCIT]) and serum titres of GSH. Secondary outcomes included performance on two other cognitive tests, serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, subjective quality of life (QoL), muscle strength (hand grip scale), faecal and blood inflammatory markers.
Results
Data from 91 participants were analysed (A1PF milk group: n = 45; conventional milk group: n = 46). A1PF milk improved performance on all three cognitive tests to a greater extent than conventional milk; however, this improvement was not associated with an increase in serum GSH. When compared with conventional milk, A1PF milk resulted in higher increases in serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, greater subjective improvements in QoL and improved left hand grip strength. There were no between-group differences in inflammatory markers, calcium absorption or bone density markers.
Conclusion
Daily intake of A1PF milk for 90 days significantly improved cognition, QoL and muscle strength in a sample of older people with MCI. While these outcomes appear to be linked to increased serum titres of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, further investigations are needed to confirm this association.
Clinical trial registration
NCT05741047 (clinicaltrials.gov).}
