abstract = {In the 21st century, health care has been going through a paradigm shift called digital health. Due to major advances and breakthroughs in information technologies, most recently artificial intelligence, the patriarchy of the doctor-patient relationship has started evolving toward an equal-level partnership with initial signs of patient autonomy. Being an underused resource for centuries, patients have started to contribute to their care with information, data, insights, preferences, and knowledge. It is important to recognize that at its core, digital health represents a cultural transformation, where patient empowerment has likely played the most significant role in driving these changes. This viewpoint paper traces the remarkable journey of patient empowerment from its nascent stages to its current prominence in shaping health care’s future. Spanning over two and a half decades, we explore pivotal moments and technological advancements that have revolutionized the patient’s role in health care. We dive into a few historical milestones, mainly in the United States, that have challenged and redefined societal norms around agency, drawing parallels between patient empowerment and broader social movements, such as the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements. Through these lenses, we argue that patient empowerment is not solely a function of knowledge or technology but requires a fundamental shift in societal attitudes, policies, health care culture, and practices. As we look to the future, we posit that the continued empowerment of patients will play a pivotal role in the development of more equitable, effective, and personalized health care systems. This paper calls for an ongoing commitment to fostering environments that support patient agency, access to resources, and the realization of patient potential in navigating and contributing to their health outcomes with an emphasis on the emerging significance of patient design.}

The research explores the relationship between shareholder structure and CSR investment, and the mediating role of analyst coverage. The results indicate that ownership structure significantly influences CSR investment, with ownership concentration and checks and balances positively correlated with CSR. The research also finds that analyst coverage mediates the relationship between ownership structure and CSR investment. Specifically, state - owned enterprises (SOEs) exhibit higher CSR investments compared to non - SOEs, and the shareholding structure of SOEs has a more pronounced impact on CSR investment. The findings suggest that enhancing ownership concentration and balance can effectively improve CSR value. The research concludes that a balanced equity structure and increased analyst coverage promote CSR investment, contributing to sustainable corporate development. The results have implications for policymakers, suggesting that refining shareholding structures to emphasize concentration and balance can better align corporate strategies with social responsibilities, fostering harmonious advancement of financial, community, and ecological interests.}

abstract = {Objective
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have improved many aspects of healthcare but also introduced challenges, including increased documentation and reduced patient-provider interaction. With recent artificial intelligence (AI) developments in the EHR landscape, such as Automated Medical Reporting (AMR) technologies that aim to automate visit summarization, there is a need to understand how these innovations affect medical interactions. However, methodological inconsistencies in existing studies on EHR use and medical interactions limit study comparability. This scoping review identifies methods to study the impact of EHR use on patient-provider interaction, providing a foundation for future evaluations of AMR implementations.
Methods
A systematic search identified empirical studies (2015-present) on patient-provider interaction involving EHRs, supplemented by three prior reviews. Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction focused on research methods, concepts, indicators, and measurement tools used.
Results
The review identified diverse methods to study EHR use within medical interactions, including video/audio analysis, structured observation, surveys, and interviews. Studies focused on concepts such as patient-centered communication, attention, satisfaction, computer interaction, and room layout, using diverse standardized and self-developed instruments. Most studies treated EHR use as separate from medical interaction. A smaller group used qualitative methods, such as conversation analysis and ethnography, to explore how EHR use is embedded in medical interaction. Indicators included gaze, typing, talk time, and consultation length.
Conclusion
Two dominant approaches emerged: one treating EHR use as separate from medical interaction, and another, less common, viewing both as functionally integrated. While various concepts and instruments were identified, many studies relied on unvalidated, non-experimental methods, limiting comparability and causal inference. A key gap remains in standardized methods that link broad communication concepts with specific functional behaviors. As AI-driven tools like AMR emerge, future research needs to adopt more integrative approaches to assess their impact and support human-centered EHR design.}

abstract = {In recent years, considerable advancements have been made in developing in vitro models to better understand the complex dynamics of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its critical role in neurological health and disease. Incorporating astrocytes into these models introduces an essential layer of complexity, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of the cellular interactions and regulatory mechanisms that maintain BBB integrity and functionality. Despite these advances, the specific influence of astrocytes on endothelial cells in in vitro systems remains inadequately explored. This study addresses this gap by examining the transcriptional changes in primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) cocultured with human astrocytes (HAs). Our findings demonstrate that astrocytes profoundly modulate endothelial pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and division while upregulating genes associated with BBB integrity, protective mechanisms, and transporter activity. Furthermore, astrocytes significantly enhanced transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced permeability to tracer Cascade Blue dye, confirming their functional impact on BBB models. By providing a comprehensive human primary cell dataset, this research underscores the pivotal role astrocytes play in shaping endothelial cell gene expression and function in contact coculture systems. These results emphasize the necessity of incorporating astrocytes into in vitro BBB models to accurately replicate neurovascular interactions. Ultimately, this study advances our understanding of BBB physiology and highlights the importance of refining in vitro models to better reflect the complexity of the human neurovascular environment, with potential implications for studying neurological disorders and drug delivery strategies.}

The present study aimed to systematically investigate the interrelationship between three-dimensional knee kinematics during walking and stair climbing and ex-vivo electromechanical measured cartilage quality in 119 patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty surgery underwent radiographic assessment and biomechanical analysis in gait and stair climbing assessing in vivo knee joint angles and moments during movement dynamics prior to surgery. Electromechanical properties of the excised tibial cartilage as an indicator of cartilage quality were evaluated using Arthro-BST. Peak knee adduction angle was found to be a significant predictor of medial cartilage quality during walking (R2 = 22 %, p < 0.001) and stair climbing (R2 = 13 %, p < 0.001). During walking, knee flexion moment was found to be a strong predictor of medial (R2 = 9 %, p = 0.002) and lateral cartilage quality (R2 = 12 %, p < 0.001). Knee adduction (R2 = 19 %, p < 0.001) and abduction angles (R2 = 44 %, p < 0.01) during x-ray was significantly associated with dynamic assessments during 3D kinematics. Medial joint space width significantly predicted medial tibial cartilage quality (R2 = 16 %, p < 0.001). The results showed that biomechanical parameters such as varus malalignment during walking and stair climbing are significantly associated with tibial cartilage deterioration and contribute to a variance explanation of 13–22%.}

Initially seen as a cellular aging mechanism, it is now recognized for its roles in development, tissu repair and tumour suppression. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. Recent efforts have focused on “senotherapeutics”, including senolytics, which aim to eliminate senescent cells to mitigate age-related decline. Despite significant advances, senescence research faces critical challenges because of inconsistent detection methods. Common markers, such as p16INK4a and senescence-associated β-galactosidase, vary across tissues and contexts, complicating cross-study comparisons and clinical applications. A standardized multifaceted approach to senescence detection is essential, and should incorporate complementary methods, clear thresholds for senescence classification and considerations for cell type-specific variations. Such standardization would enhance reproducibility, streamline research and facilitate clinical translation, advancing therapeutic applications in aging and disease management.}

abstract = {Background
Globally, the incidence of breast cancer continues to rise; however, mortality rates are declining due to the growing effectiveness of targeted therapies and treatments. Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is seen in ∼15% of breast cancers (termed HER2+). Trastuzumab is the standard HER2-targeted therapy for HER2+ breast cancers in the adjuvant setting, and is increasingly being used as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (NACT or NAC). However, as well as the clinical impact, using drugs in a different treatment setting (including neoadjuvant) has a financial impact. Economic evaluation of novel chemotherapeutic strategies can assess both clinical utility and cost-effectiveness, thereby informing and guiding healthcare resource allocation decisions. Currently, the cost, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of single-agent neoadjuvant Trastuzumab remain underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Trastuzumab administered as neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, or a combination of both regimens (NACT/ACT).
Methods
A 3-year retrospective observational comparative analysis was conducted to examine costs and health outcomes using clinicopathological data (treatment type, surgical procedure, breast cancer subtype) from a public hospital in Ireland. Overall, 192 non-metastatic, non-palliative HER2+ breast cancer patients (Luminal B HER2, and HER2+ [non-luminal]) were selected (151 adjuvant Trastuzumab treated, 28 neoadjuvant Trastuzumab treated, 13 NACT/ACT Trastuzumab treated). The analysis estimated the cost of treatment (chemotherapy regimen, surgery type) and health outcomes, which were evaluated by analysis of survival data, and by calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs). Multivariate regression analysis, using survival regression model techniques, was performed to evaluate associations between treatment types and total costs- adjusted by age, stage, grade, and subtype. A Cox proportional hazard model estimated the effect of treatment alternatives for time to disease-free survival (DFS).
Results
Multivariate analysis demonstrated no significant difference in treatment cost (p=0.318), surgery cost (p=0.951), or DFS (p=0.236) between the adjuvant and neoadjuvant Trastuzumab treatment groups. A significantly increased cost of treatment was observed in older patients (p=0.011) and patients with Grade 3 tumours (p=0.037). No significant difference in cost was found between the HER2 subtype groups (p=0.129) or between disease stages (p=0.71). No significant difference in QALY was observed between adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment groups (p=0.296).
Conclusion
Overall, while adjuvant Trastuzumab remains the most cost-effective strategy for patients with HER2+ breast cancer, adopting a neoadjuvant Trastuzumab approach does not appear to pose a significant economic disadvantage. Notably, higher treatment costs were observed among older patients, a finding with important financial implications for healthcare systems. These results highlight the need for careful evaluation to inform forthcoming age-related cancer policy updates.}

However, the majority of existing methods have overlooked the specific requirements and challenges inherent in fusion tasks under low-light conditions. In such scenes, texture degradation due to poor illumination is common, and furthermore, local overexposure may result in significant information loss. To tackle these challenges, a novel framework named BICFusion is introduced, which addresses these issues through reflectance separation, cross-modal feature compensation, and dual enhancement of texture and contrast. The Retinex theory is employed to design a network that extracts reflectance representing the intrinsic structure and details of the scene from the visible image, thereby providing the fusion result with rich structural information under minimal illumination constraints. The cross-modal feature guidance weighting module (CFGW) is developed to compensate for missing details by leveraging the infrared image when the visible image lacks sufficient texture information due to adverse lighting conditions such as low light or overexposure. Subsequently, the texture enhancement fusion module (TEFM) and the global-local contrast enhancement loss function are proposed to jointly enhance the fusion quality in terms of texture and contrast. Experiments conducted with twelve state-of-the-art methods on three publicly available datasets validate the superior performance of BICFusion in preserving fine details under low-light and overexposed conditions.}

Background
The surgical outcomes and stability of patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion determine the success of treatment. Variations in surgical interventions, patient responsiveness, and growth patterns across vertical facial morphologies result in varying treatment outcomes and postoperative stability.
Methods
This retrospective study recruited 52 adults diagnosed with skeletal Class II malocclusion treated with bimaxillary surgery; these adults were divided into two groups according to their vertical facial patterns. Cone-beam computed tomography images were collected before surgery (T0), after surgery (T1), and after orthodontic treatment (T2). Reconstructed three-dimensional images were used for cephalometric measurements and analysis.
Results
From T0 to T1, the Frankfort-mandibular plane angle decreased in the high-angle group but increased in the low–medium-angle group. The mandible advanced 9.02 and 6.21 mm in the high-angle and low–medium-angle groups, respectively. From T1 to T2, significant changes were observed in the anterior mandible horizontal movement of the high-angle group (−1.91 ± 3.63 mm) compared with the low–medium-angle group (−0.57 ± 1.04 mm). There were more patients exhibit clinically significant relapse (> 2 mm) in the high-angle group (44%) than in the low–medium-angle group (20%).
Conclusion
The relapse patterns in the two groups were similarly upward and backward. However, the high angle group exhibited greater average postoperative changes. The proportion of patients who exhibited a clinically significant relapse was higher in the high angle group.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of FENa (Fractional excretion of sodium), FEK (fractional excretion of potassium) and uSID (urinary strong ion difference) in predicting pAKI in sepsis and septic shock.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
Two intensive care units in Argentina.
Patients
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and AKI, and had a urinary biochemistry within 24h of the AKI diagnosis.
Interventions
None.
Main variables of interest
We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FENa, FEK and uSID through a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis.
Results
80 patients were included. 40 patients presented pAKI. pAKI group had higher APACHE, SOFA score, and mortality rate. In the ROC curve analysis, uSID had no diagnostic utility (AUC=0.52, p=0.69). FENa presented moderate accuracy showing an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60−0.83; p=0.001), while FEK presented low accuracy with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.57−0.80; p=0.04). The optimal Youden point for identifying pAKI was at a FENa higher than 0.51 % with a specificity of 72.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%. In the case of FEK, a value higher than 21.9 % presented the best relation, with a specificity of 67.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%.
Conclusions
urine biochemistry interpretation in septic patients must be revised. FENa and FEK are related to the severity of AKI and could be helpful complementary tools for diagnosing pAKI.
Resumen

abstract = {Bortezomib is a mainstay drug for the treatment of myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, but resistance frequently develops. Overcoming bortezomib resistance is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that acevaltrate, an active ingredient from a traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits potent activity in triggering pyroptosis in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. Mechanistically, acevaltrate induces myeloma cells pyroptosis in a Caspase-3 and GSDME-dependent manner. When Caspase-3 is inhibited by its specific inhibitor or GSDME is knocked out, myeloma cells fail to undergo pyroptosis triggered by acevaltrate. Moreover, acevaltrate promotes the production of reactive oxygen species and strikingly reduces mitochondrial membrane potential. Consistent with this finding, acevaltrate dissociates BAX from its inhibitor, Bcl-2, thereby promoting BAX translocalization to mitochondria. Furthermore, IFIT3, an IFN-inducible protein, is upregulated by acevaltrate. Interestingly, while IFIT3 fails to directly induce myeloma cells pyroptosis, it markedly enhances acevaltrate-induced pyroptosis. IFIT3 binds to Bcl-2 and prevents it from interacting with BAX. Lastly, acevaltrate effectively triggers pyroptosis in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. Pre-treatment with acevaltrate significantly restores the sensitivity of resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib. Therefore, acevaltrate strongly induces myeloma cell pyroptosis and overcomes bortezomib resistance. Given its potent activity against myeloma and its established safety profile, acevaltrate warrants further evaluation in clinical settings for its potential to overcome myeloma resistance to bortezomib.}

abstract = {Introduction
Despite existing guidelines, many patients with asthma do not achieve adequate control of their disease. This is largely due to low adherence to inhaled therapy. Single-inhaler administration may improve this and other aspects of asthma therapy, such as cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study is to gather the opinions of a panel of experts on single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) for the treatment of asthma in adult patients.
Material and methods
A recommendation task force reviewed the available evidence and formulated 45 statements divided into 5 sections: efficacy, cost-effectiveness, therapeutic adherence, safety, and patient satisfaction. A validation task force of 71 experts evaluated these recommendations using the 2-round Delphi technique. Panellists rated their agreement with each statement on a 9-point scale.
Results
Consensus was achieved in 42 of the 45 statements. Panellists broadly agreed that SITT improves lung function, reduces exacerbations, is cost-effective, and promotes therapeutic adherence. The safety of TT was considered favourable, even in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. The panellists also agreed on the importance of evaluating patient satisfaction with the inhaler. However, no consensus was reached regarding the suitability of TT as a first-line treatment, nor on whether TT is more beneficial than up-dosing ICS in patients with a low inflammatory profile currently receiving dual therapy. Additionally, panellists did not agree on whether sick leave due to respiratory causes was associated with greater adherence to TT.
Conclusions
The consensus indicates that SITT is considered an effective, safe option for the treatment of asthma that improves therapeutic adherence and patient satisfaction. Further real-world studies are needed to evaluate its implementation in different clinical contexts.
Resumen
Introducción
A pesar de las directrices existentes, muchos pacientes con asma no logran un control adecuado de la enfermedad. Esto se debe en gran parte a la baja adhesión a la terapia inhalada. La administración en dispositivo único puede mejorar este y otros aspectos, como coste-efectividad del tratamiento. Este estudio tiene como objetivo desarrollar un consenso de expertos sobre la triple terapia (TT) en un solo inhalador para el tratamiento del asma en pacientes adultos.
Material y métodos
Un grupo elaborador de recomendaciones revisó la evidencia disponible y formuló 45 enunciados divididos en cinco bloques: eficacia, coste-efectividad, adhesión, seguridad y satisfacción del paciente. Un grupo validador de 71 expertos evaluó estas recomendaciones mediante el método Delphi en dos rondas. Los panelistas calificaron cada enunciado en una escala de 9 puntos para determinar su grado de acuerdo.
Resultados
Se alcanzó consenso en 42 de los 45 enunciados. Los panelistas mostraron amplio acuerdo en la eficacia de la TT en dispositivo único para mejorar la función pulmonar y reducir exacerbaciones, así como en su buen perfil de coste-efectividad y de adhesión al tratamiento. La seguridad de la TT fue considerada favorable, incluso en pacientes con comorbilidades cardiovasculares. Los panelistas también estuvieron de acuerdo en la importancia de la satisfacción del paciente con el dispositivo inhalador. Sin embargo, no se alcanzó consenso sobre la idoneidad de la TT como tratamiento de primera línea, ni sobre si la TT es más beneficiosa que el aumento de dosis de CSI en pacientes con un perfil inflamatorio bajo que ya reciben doble terapia. Además, los panelistas no estuvieron de acuerdo en que la baja laboral por causas respiratorias estuviera asociada con una mayor adhesión a la TT en dispositivo único.
Conclusiones
El consenso indica que la TT en un solo dispositivo se considera una opción efectiva y segura para el tratamiento del asma, mejorando la adherencia y la satisfacción del paciente. Se destaca la necesidad de más estudios en vida real para evaluar su implementación en diferentes contextos clínicos.}

We recruited 75 students and provided them with sequential failure feedback based on self-comparison or social-comparison, and their performance on the three components of EF was subsequently recorded. Results indicated that for the perfectionists, receiving feedback that their performance was inferior to others served as a stronger facilitator of EF than when they performed worse than their own goals. Moreover, individual differences were observed. The Mixed-perfectionism group, i.e., those high in both Perfectionism striving (PS) and Perfectionism concern (PC), were more sensitive to social-comparison feedback, whereas those in the Pure PS group were more sensitive to self-comparison feedback. Additionally, the extent of these effects varied across the three components of EF. Strategies for maximizing the facilitative effects of feedback on cognition based on individual differences are discussed.}

In the site selection phase for GCS projects, the saturation of irreducible water is a vital indicator used to calculate the storage capacity and assess the feasibility of GCS projects. Due to its high efficiency in characterizing the petrophysical properties of porous rocks, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology is an indispensable tool for analyzing irreducible water. However, limited core samples and time-consuming experiments result in scarce matched NMR data from centrifuged and saturated states, challenging the study of irreducible water for GCS projects through machine learning. Moreover, the traditional single T2 cutoff methods for determining irreducible water saturation exhibit significant errors, making precise calculation of storage capacity challenging. To overcome these obstacles, the application of Generative Adversarial Networks is proposed to enhance training data richness and lay a foundation for using machine learning to investigate irreducible water properties. When selecting the appropriate data form and network structure, amplitude variations in T2 distributions at saturated and centrifuged states were considered, and the generator and discriminator models developed with the data form of type 1 showed the best performance. Furthermore, the Random Forest algorithm is introduced to predict the tapered T2 cutoff value, further deriving the T2 distribution of irreducible water and ultimately yielding more accurate irreducible water saturation. This accurate assessment is essential for calculating both static and dynamic storage capacities, which provide critical benchmarks for project operators in source-sink matching, ensuring efficient and cost-effective storage objectives. Additionally, it enables the acquisition of the T2 distribution of free water, which is difficult to obtain with traditional methods. This extra information can provide more guidance for the site selection and injection phases of GCS projects. The proposed method, by integrating advanced machine learning techniques, offers significant improvements over traditional methods in investigating irreducible water properties, presenting a promising application outlook in GCS projects.}

This study investigates the impact of user experience on user stickiness in governmental chatbots, employing a segmented, scenario-based approach to assess variations across different user groups and technology levels. By analyzing data from groups with either practical or policy-oriented knowledge, the study explores how the integration of basic and advanced artificial intelligence technologies influences the retention of users interacting with governmental digital services. The core findings reveal that user experience significantly enhances user stickiness across all scenarios and user types, independent of the users' level of online institutionalized political participation. This study indicates that the effectiveness of user experience strategies in governmental chatbots is largely autonomous from the users' political engagement, suggesting that the intrinsic quality of the user interface is a more critical factor in promoting user retention than previously understood.}

Colleges and schools of pharmacy have implemented co-curricular programs that complement didactic and experiential learning within Doctor of Pharmacy programs. These programs are varied but all are directed at achieving educational outcomes, which may change based on accreditation standards.
Objective
The objective of this project was to describe student and faculty perceptions of the co-curricular program in one doctor of pharmacy program.
Methods
Two surveys were developed to assess the co-curricular program, one for faculty and one for students. Both surveys consisted of quantitative and qualitative elements, and both were comprised of three sections: overall program satisfaction, activities and reflections, and program logistics. Surveys were distributed via email to all Doctor of Pharmacy students and faculty and remained open for two weeks.
Results
Response rate for the faculty and student surveys was 59.3 % (19 of 32) and 48.2 % (131 of 272), respectively. Overall satisfaction with the co-curricular program was rated as a median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR], 6–8) for faculty and a median of 6 (IQR, 5–8) for students on a 10-point scale with 10 being the most highly satisfied and one being not satisfied at all. Qualitative results revealed that faculty and students supported the program and its intent but find room for improvements. Suggested improvements included: ensuring consistent offerings of co-curricular activities in both quantity and quality, decreasing the number of required reflections, and encouraging timeliness and quality in student submissions and in faculty reviews.
Conclusion
Faculty and students expressed general support for the co-curricular program and offered several ways to enhance the program. These insights will be important to improve the program in this college of pharmacy and beyond, especially with new accreditation standards and educational outcomes.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
Posterior pelvic ring disruption has been associated with high-energy trauma, and significant morbidity and mortality. We aimed to determine functional and radiological outcomes following sacroiliac screw fixation of posterior pelvic ring injuries at a major trauma centre.
Methods
Patients who underwent sacroiliac screw fixation at our institution, between 1st January 2013 – 1st April 2020 were identified from a database. Electronic systems were accessed to obtain information regarding patient demographics, injuries sustained, and interventions performed. Patients were contacted via telephone regarding clinical outcomes (EQ5D3L, EQVAS and Majeed scores). Radiographical outcomes were assessed using the Keshishyan cross-measure method.
Results
115 patients were identified. The mean age at injury was 51.6 years (17–84 years). Most injuries resulted from falls and road traffic collisions (83.5 %). Eighty patients (69.6 %) sustained additional non-pelvic injuries and twenty-nine (25.2 %) underwent a non-pelvic procedure, most commonly limb or clavicle fracture fixation (N = 19). Thirty-day and 12-month all-cause mortality rates were 0.9 % and 1.7 %, respectively. Clinical outcomes were obtained for 82/105 possible patients (78.1 %). Regarding EQ5D3L, 36/82 patients (43.9 %) reported a full health status; only six patients reported severe problems. The mean Majeed score was 70.3. 49/59 patients (86.0 %) returned to their pre-injury employment. A significant association was found between the clinical outcomes (EQ5D3L index, EQVAS, Majeed score) and the pre-operative asymmetry value and deformity index but not the post-operative asymmetry value and deformity index. One patient (0.9 %) required revision for infection, 12 patients (10.4 %) reported post-operative lower limb paraesthesia, and one patient (0.9 %) experienced a post-operative deep vein thrombus.
Conclusions
Most patients with pelvic ring injuries experienced high-energy trauma, often resulting in multiple injuries and operative interventions. Nevertheless, mortality rates were low, and most patients experienced either mild or no functional difficulties. The magnitude of the pelvic deformity pre-operatively correlates with post-operative clinical scores.}

However, long-term application may lead to nutrient saturation, leaching, and potential impairment of ground and surface water quality. We studied long-term effects of reclaimed water application on nutrient leaching potential in a four-decade time series of forest water reclamation facilities in northern Idaho. Our approach compared reclaimed water treated plots with untreated control plots at each of the forest water reclamation facilities. We measured soil nitrifier abundance and net nitrification rates and used tension lysimeters to sample soil matrix water and drain gauges to sample from a combination of matrix and preferential flow paths. We determined nutrient leaching as the product of soil water nutrient concentrations and model-estimated drainage flux. There was more than 450-fold increase in nitrifier abundance and a 1000-fold increase in net nitrification rates in treated plots compared with control plots at long-established facilities, indicating greater nitrate production with increased cumulative inputs. There were no differences in soil water ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations between control and effluent treatments in tension lysimeter samples. However, concurrent with increased nitrifier abundance and net nitrification, nitrate concentration below the rooting zone was 2 to 4-fold higher and nitrate leaching was 4 to 10-fold higher in effluent treated plots, particularly at facilities that have been in operation for over two decades. Thus, net nitrification and nitrifier abundance assays are likely indicators of nitrate leaching potential. Inorganic nutrient concentrations in drain gauge samples were 2 to 11-fold higher than lysimeter samples, suggesting nutrient losses occurred predominantly through preferential flow paths. Nitrate was vulnerable to leaching during the wet season under saturated flow conditions. Although nitrogen saturation is a concern that should be mitigated at long-established facilities, these forest water reclamation facilities were able to maintain average soil water nitrate concentrations to less than 2 mg L−1, so that nitrogen and phosphorous are effectively filtered to below safe water standards.}

abstract = {Background
Nephrolithiasis is not a well-documented condition in children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It is possible that this condition was underestimated before the era of nusinersen because of a much shorter life expectancy. We present our observational data on nephrolithiasis and its possible risk factors in children with type 1 SMA.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 20 children with genetically confirmed type 1 SMA. Thirteen patients (aged 9 to 55 months) who underwent urinary tract ultrasonography were included in the study. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics, ultrasound results, and metabolic abnormalities.
Results
Seven children (54%) had nephrolithiasis; 5 had multiple stones and two had a single stone. Two patients had microlithiasis (<3 mm), three had a stone in the size of 3 to 5 mm, and one had a stone in the size of more than 8 mm. Two patients with nephrolithiasis had urinary tract abnormalities. Patients with nephrolithiasis were more likely to have a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) (P = 0.048) and higher urine specific gravity (P = 0.014) than patients without nephrolithiasis. Five of seven children with nephrolithiasis had a urine metabolic evaluation; all had hypercalciuria, three had hyperuricosuria, but none had hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, or hypomagnesemia.
Conclusion
Children with SMA type 1 are at an increased risk for nephrolithiasis. Hypercalciuria and high urine specific gravity appear to be the most common risk factors for the occurrence of nephrolithiasis. In addition, UTI is more common in patients with type 1 SMA with nephrolithiasis.}

abstract = {Hypothesis
Although antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of new antibiotics, their inherent susceptibility to degradation requires nanocarrier-mediated delivery. While cubosome nanocarriers have been extensively studied for delivery of AMPs, we do not currently understand why cubosome encapsulation improves antimicrobial efficacy for some compounds but not others. This study therefore aims to investigate the link between the mechanism of action and permeation efficiency of the peptides, their encapsulation efficacy, and the antimicrobial activity of these systems.
Experiments
Encapsulation and delivery of Indolicidin, and its ultra-short derivative, Priscilicidin, were investigated using SAXS, cryo-TEM and circular dichroism. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to understand the loading of these peptides within cubosomes. The antimicrobial efficacy was assessed against gram-negative (E. coli) and gram-positive (MRSA) bacteria.
Findings
A high ionic strength solution was required to facilitate high loading of the cationic AMPs, with bilayer encapsulation driven by tryptophan and Fmoc moieties. Cubosome encapsulation did not improve the antimicrobial efficacy of the AMPs consistent with their high permeation, as explained by a recent ’diffusion to capture model’. This suggests that cubosome encapsulation may not be an effective strategy for all antimicrobial compounds, paving the way for improved selection of nanocarriers for AMPs, and other antimicrobial compounds.}

This study proposes an enhanced deep learning framework, SE-ResNet50, which integrates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block into the conventional ResNet50 architecture to improve the classification of diabetic kidney pathology from glomerular images. The SE block adaptively recalibrates feature responses, enabling the model to emphasize diagnostically relevant structures better. The proposed framework was trained and validated on a kidney tissue dataset from Kanazawa Medical University, achieving superior performance with an accuracy of 97.02 ​%, precision of 0.96, and an AUC of 0.9856. SE-ResNet50 exhibited superior robustness and generalizability compared to established CNN architectures such as EfficientNet B0, Inception V3, and ConvNeXt. Further visualization via Grad-CAM revealed that the model effectively localizes critical regions within glomerular images. These results highlight the potential of SE-ResNet50 as a reliable and interpretable tool for advancing diabetes-related CKD diagnosis in clinical settings.}

To evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in generating valid multiple-choice exam items for assessing therapeutic knowledge in pharmacy education.
Methods
A custom GPT application was developed to create 60 case-based items from a pharmacotherapy textbook. Nine subject matter experts reviewed items for content validity, difficulty, and quality. Valid items were compiled into a 38-question exam administered to 46 fourth-year pharmacy students. Classical test theory and Rasch analysis were used to assess psychometric properties.
Results
Of 60 generated items, 38 met content validity requirements, with only 6 accepted without revisions. The exam demonstrated moderate reliability and correlated well with a prior cumulative therapeutics exam. Classical item analysis revealed that most items had acceptable point biserial correlations, though fewer than half fell within the recommended difficulty range. Rasch analysis indicated potential multidimensionality and suboptimal targeting of item difficulty to student ability.
Conclusion
GPT-4 offers a preliminary step toward generating exam content in pharmacy education but has clear limitations that require further investigation and validation. Substantial human oversight and psychometric evaluation are necessary to ensure clinical realism and appropriate difficulty. Future research with larger samples is needed to further validate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in item generation for high-stakes assessments in pharmacy education.}

For example, the (Datagram) Transport Layer Security “(D)TLS” 1.2/1.3 was designed to help industries implement and integrate such methods through underpinning infrastructures of Internet of Everything (IoE) environments with efficiency and efficacy in mind. The main goal underpinning such protocols is to protect the Internet connections between IoE machines from malicious activities such as unauthorized eavesdropping, monitoring, and tampering with messages. In theory, these protocols are supposed to be secure. Still, most existing implementations partially follow the standard features of (D)TLS 1.2/3, leaving them vulnerable to risks such as side-channel and network attacks. In this paper, we critically review the standard protocols deployed for the security management of data and connected machines, and also examine the recently discovered vulnerabilities that lead to successful zero-day attacks in IoE environments. Then, we discuss various potential countermeasures in the form of organizational policy enforcement strategies and mitigation approaches that can be used by cybersecurity practitioners, decision- and policy-makers. Finally, we identify both proactive and reactive solutions for further consideration and study, as well as propose alternative mechanisms and e-governance policies for standardizing organizations and engineers in future solution designs.}

abstract = {Background
Asthma (AS) and allergic rhinitis (AR), though sharing Th2-driven inflammation, exhibit distinct clinical trajectories, with molecular mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remaining poorly characterized. This study aimed to delineate conserved and divergent immunometabolic pathways and develop a blood-based diagnostic framework integrating multi-omics biomarkers.
Methods
We harmonized 8 peripheral blood transcriptomic cohorts (n = 1,073) using ComBat correction, performed Mendelian randomization (MR) across 5 asthma cohorts (FinnGen Release 12), and constructed a combinatorial machine learning model (113 configurations) validated in 5 independent cohorts.
Results
Bidirectional regulation of the Y-chromosomal gene RPS4Y1 (upregulated in AR, downregulated in AS) was linked to disease-specific immunometabolic reprogramming (P < 0.001). MR identified 7 causal plasma proteins (GRAMD1C, GSTO1, IL1RAP, MMP9, PDXK, SAT2, SIGLEC12) intersecting transcriptomic signatures, implicating oxidative stress as a shared mechanism. The glmBoost-RF diagnostic model integrating these biomarkers achieved superior accuracy (AUC >95% in 4/5 cohorts), outperforming conventional classifiers reliant on IgE or eosinophils. Immune profiling revealed AR-specific native B-cell expansion and Treg depletion versus AS-associated CD4+ T/NK cell activation (P < 0.05). Coordinated dysregulation of Y-chromosomal genes (EIF1AY, KDM5D) suggested sex-dimorphic immune modulation.
Conclusions
This integrative analysis establishes RPS4Y1 as a central regulator of allergic inflammation dimorphism and delivers a validated multi-omics classifier for precision diagnostics. The findings bridge molecular sex differences, metabolic-immune crosstalk, and clinical heterogeneity, advancing phenotype-specific therapeutic strategies.}

abstract = {Background
The health-related quality of life (HRQoL), economic burden, and diagnostic and treatment status of Chinese patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) remain largely unknown. This study assessed patient characteristics, HRQoL, and economic burden among Chinese patients with MF and SS through a cross-sectional survey.
Methods
Eligible patients were aged ≥18 years with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of MF or SS and were either currently receiving or had received disease-specific treatment within the past year. Patients completed a paper-based quantitative survey covering four components: patient demographics, diagnosis and treatment journey, economic burden, and HRQoL instrument.
Results
Between July 21, 2022, and October 24, 2022, 61 eligible patients participated in this study, of whom 91.8% (56/61) had MF and 8.2% (5/61) had SS. The total cost for patients with MF and SS was Chinese Yuan (CNY) 86,729 (US Dollar [USD] 12,425). The total cost for patients with early-stage disease was significantly lower than that for patients with advanced-stage disease (CNY 43,379 vs. 128,681, P < 0.001). The direct cost for MF and SS patients was CNY 72,467 (USD 10,382). The direct cost for patients with early-stage disease was significantly lower than that for patients with advanced-stage disease (CNY 29,018 vs. 114,514, P < 0.001). The direct medical cost for MF and SS patients was CNY 65,524 (USD 9387). The direct medical cost for patients with early-stage disease was significantly lower than that for patients with advanced-stage disease (CNY 23,069 vs. 106,609, P < 0.001). Regarding HRQoL, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) score of Chinese time trade-off values for 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) health states was 0.79 (0.18) for all respondents. The mean utility score for advanced-stage patients was significantly lower than that of early-stage patients (advanced-stage: 0.73 [0.18] vs. early-stage: 0.84 [0.16], P = 0.010). On the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale, the mean (SD) score for all patients with MF or SS was 61.3 (12.4). Advanced-stage patients had lower mean scores than early-stage patients, indicating poorer HRQoL (early-stage: 65.50 [13.48] vs. advanced-stage: 57.26 [9.96], P = 0.009). For the Skindex-29 instrument, the mean (SD) score was 43.4 (24.2).
Conclusions
Chinese patients with MF or SS, especially advanced-stage patients, experience high economic burden and compromised HRQoL, which underscore the need for improved access to affordable treatments and supportive care measures to reduce the financial burden and enhance the well-being of these patients. Healthcare policies and interventions should prioritize early diagnosis and effective management to improve the treatment outcome and reduce its associated costs.}

Technological advances over the past century have accelerated the pace and breadth of medical and surgical care. From the initial delivery of “telemedicine” over the radio in the 1920s, the delivery of medicine and surgery in the 21st century is no longer limited by connectivity. The COVID-19 pandemic hastened the uptake of telemedicine to ensure that health care can be maintained despite limited face-to-face contact. Like other areas of medicine, vascular surgery has adopted telemedicine, although its role is not well described in the literature. This narrative review explores how telemedicine has been delivered in vascular surgery. Specific themes of telemedicine are outlined with real-world examples, including consultation, triaging, collaboration, mentoring, monitoring and surveillance, mobile health, and education. This review also explores possible future advances in telemedicine and issues around equity of care. Finally, important ethical considerations and limitations related to the applications of telemedicine are outlined.}

abstract = {Summary
Albumin is a relatively small molecule with a radius of 7.5 nm and a molecular weight of 65 kDa. It is the most abundant protein in plasma, accounting for 60–75% of its oncotic pressure. Its concentration in plasma is merely one static measurement reflecting a dynamic and complex system of albumin physiology, and is the net result of several different processes, one or more of which may become deranged by disease or its treatment. It is also unsurprising that hypoalbuminaemia has proved to be an indicator of morbidity and mortality risk since the underlying conditions which cause it, including protein energy malnutrition, crystalloid overload, inflammation, and liver dysfunction are themselves risk factors. In some cases, its underlying cause may require treatment but mostly it is just a parameter to be monitored and used as one measure of clinical progress or deterioration. While malnutrition, associated with a low protein intake, may be a contributory cause of hypoalbuminaemia, in the absence of inflammation and/or dilution with crystalloid its development in response to malnutrition alone is slow compared with the rapid change caused by inflammatory redistribution or dilution with crystalloids. Other significant causes include liver dysfunction and serous losses. These causal factors may occur singly or in combination in any particular case. Treatment is that of the underlying causes and associated conditions such as a low plasma volume, not of hypoalbuminaemia per se.}

This conserved modification interacts with vital cellular pathways. Although O-GlcNAc is widely distributed throughout the body, it is particularly enriched in the brain, where most proteins are O-GlcNAcylated. Recent studies have established a causal link between O-GlcNAc regulation in the brain and alterations in neurophysiological function. Alterations in O-GlcNAc levels in the brain are associated with the pathogenesis of several neurogenic diseases that can lead to cognitive impairment. Remarkably, manipulation of O-GlcNAc levels demonstrated a protective effect on cognitive function. Although the precise molecular mechanism of O-GlcNAc modification in the nervous system remains elusive, its regulation is fundamental to multiple neural and cognitive functions, fluctuating levels during normal and pathological cognitive processes. In this review, we highlight the significant functional importance of O-GlcNAc modification in pathological cognitive impairments and the potential application of O-GlcNAc as a promising target for the intervention or amelioration of cognitive impairments.}

Mortality rates were standardized against the 2010 census population of China (ASMRC) and Segi's world population (ASMRW). Joinpoint regression models were used to analyze temporal trends. Our findings indicated an estimated 14,568 MM-related deaths in China. The observed crude mortality rates ASMRC, and ASMRW were 1.04, 0.80, and 0.62 per 100,000 individuals, respectively. A notable sex-related difference in mortality rates was evident, with male mortalities (8,319) surpassing female mortalities (6,249) by a factor of 1.33. Age-wise, mortality rates tended to increase after 55 years, reaching a maximum in those over 85 years (7.09 per 100,000 individuals). Provincial data revealed that the highest ASMRCs were in Zhejiang, Beijing, and Jiangxi, whereas the lowest were in Tibet, Qinghai, and Hainan. The period from 2013 to 2020 exhibited a significant increase of 58.09 % in MM mortality, with urban and rural areas exhibiting a 44.97 % and 70.94 % increase, respectively.

abstract = {ChatGPT4 is a leading large language model (LLM) chatbot released by OpenAI in 2023. ChatGPT4 can respond to free-text queries, answer questions and make suggestions regarding virtually any topic. ChatGPT4 has successfully answered anesthesia and even obstetric anesthesia knowledge-based questions with reasonable accuracy. However, ChatGPT4 has yet to be challenged in obstetric anesthesia clinical decision-making. Study Objective: In this study, we evaluated the performance of ChatGPT4 in the management of clinical labor analgesia scenarios compared to expert obstetric anesthesiologists. Intervention: Eight clinical questions with progressively increasing medical complexity were posed to ChatGPT4. Measurements: The ChatGPT4 responses were rated by seven expert obstetric anesthesiologists based on safety, accuracy and completeness of each response using a five-point Likert rating scale. Main Results: ChatGPT4 was deemed safe in 73% of responses to the presented obstetric anesthesia clinical scenarios (27% of responses were deemed unsafe). None of the ChatGPT4 responses were unanimously deemed to be safe by all seven expert obstetric anesthesiologists. Moreover, ChatGPT4 responses were overall partly accurate (score 4 out of 5) and somewhat incomplete (score 3.5 out of 5). Conclusions: In summary, approximately one quarter of all responses by ChatGPT4 were deemed unsafe by expert obstetric anesthesiologists. These findings may suggest the need for more fine-tuning and training of LLMs such as ChatGPT4 specifically for clinical decision making in obstetric anesthesia or other specialized medical fields. These LLMs may come to play an important future role in assisting obstetric anesthesiologists in clinical decision making and enhancing overall patient care.}

abstract = {Background
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled development of natural language algorithms capable of generating coherent texts. We evaluated the quality, validity, and safety of this generative AI in preoperative anaesthetic planning.
Methods
In this exploratory, single-centre, convergent mixed-method study, 10 clinical vignettes were randomly selected, and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 4.0) was prompted to create anaesthetic plans, including cardiopulmonary risk assessment, intraoperative anaesthesia technique, and postoperative management. A quantitative assessment compared these plans with those made by eight senior anaesthesia consultants. A qualitative assessment was performed by an adjudication committee through focus group discussion and thematic analysis. Agreement on cardiopulmonary risk assessment was calculated using weighted Kappa, with descriptive data representation for other outcomes.
Results
ChatGPT anaesthetic plans showed variable agreement with consultants' plans. ChatGPT, the survey panel, and adjudication committee frequently disagreed on cardiopulmonary risk estimation. The ChatGPT answers were repetitive and lacked variety, evidenced by the strong preference for general anaesthesia and absence of locoregional techniques. It also showed inconsistent choices regarding airway management, postoperative analgesia, and medication use. While some differences were not deemed clinically significant, subpar postoperative pain management advice and failure to recommend tracheal intubation for patients at high risk for pulmonary aspiration were considered inappropriate recommendations.
Conclusions
Preoperative anaesthetic plans generated by ChatGPT did not consistently meet minimum clinical standards and were unlikely the result of clinical reasoning. Therefore, ChatGPT is currently not recommended for preoperative planning. Future large language models trained on anaesthesia-specific datasets might improve performance but should undergo vigorous evaluation before use in clinical practice.}

To evaluate the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-4o in accurately identifying features and categories from thyroid nodule ultrasound images following the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS).
Methods
This comparative validation study, conducted between October 2023 and May 2024, utilized 202 thyroid ultrasound images sourced from 3 open-access databases. Both complete and cropped versions of each image were independently evaluated by expert radiologists to establish a reference standard for TI-RADS features and categories. GPT-4 and GPT-4o were prompted to analyze each image, and their generated TI-RADS outputs were compared to the reference standard.
Results
GPT-4 demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity when assessing complete thyroid ultrasound images across most TI-RADS categories, resulting in mixed overall accuracy. For low-risk nodules (benign), GPT-4 achieved 25.0% sensitivity, 99.5% specificity, and 93.6% accuracy. In contrast, in the higher risk moderately suspicious category GPT-4 showed 75% sensitivity, 22.2% specificity, and 42.1% accuracy. While GPT-4 effectively identified features like smooth margins (73% vs 65% the reference standard), it struggled to identify other features like isoechoic echogenicity (5% vs 46%), and echogenic foci (3% vs 27%). The assessment of cropped images using both GPT-4 and GPT-4o followed similar patterns, though with slight deviations indicating a decrease in performance compared to GPT-4's assessment of complete images.
Conclusion
While GPT-4 and GPT-4o models show potential for improving the efficiency of thyroid nodule triage, their performance remains suboptimal, particularly in higher-risk categories. Further refinement and validation of these models are necessary before clinical implementation.}

abstract = {Introduction
As medical education increasingly incorporates digital methods such as video lectures, e-learning, and virtual meetings, it becomes crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual classrooms in teaching surgical techniques. This study aims to assess whether live virtual classrooms can effectively convey surgical skills to medical students.
Methods
First- and second-y medical students were randomized to in-person or live-video sessions once a week, for 2 wk. Students were taught how to perform simple interrupted sutures with instrument-tying. At the end of the workshop, participants were recorded performing simple interrupted sutures. Postinstruction skills videos, blinded to student group placement, were graded from 1 to 5 based on instrument handling, time, efficiency, tissue handling, wound closure, and overall technique.
Results
Out of 114 enrolled students, 42 completed the workshop. Notably, the virtual group had a significantly higher proportion of dropouts than the in-person group. Rubric scores showed no significant differences in various skill categories between the two groups. While both groups acknowledged the helpfulness of their respective methods, a majority expressed a preference for in-person instruction. The postcourse survey revealed that students valued in-person instruction for real-time feedback and multiple-angle demonstrations.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that video instruction may be equally effective in improving students' surgical technique compared to live sessions. However, it also highlights a clear personal preference among students for in-person instruction, emphasizing the value of a personalized, hands-on approach and enhanced visibility provided by in-person teaching methods.}

ChatGPT, a large language model introduced in November 2022, offers a potential solution for this problem. To examine the potential reliability and credibility of leveraging ChatGPT for argumentation feedback, the study conducted a retrospective analysis by applying ChatGPT to generate feedback on 50 sets of argumentation contents that human teachers had previously assessed. The study first assessed the feedback accuracy of ChatGPT and the factors that influenced the evaluation of arguments. The findings showed that ChatGPT demonstrated impressive precision rate (91.8 %) and recall rate (63.2 %) when providing feedback on arguments, indicating that ChatGPT possesses a fundamental capability to provide feedback on arguments. However, this capability of ChatGPT was significantly affected by the length of arguments and the discourse markers used in the arguments. The study then qualitatively compared the ChatGPT's feedback and teacher's feedback. The results revealed that these two types of feedback each had their own advantages and disadvantages. While ChatGPT could potentially generate comprehensive feedback and textual-based feedback, and limited to the linguistic level when provide affective feedback, teacher's feedback was more focused on student's overall learning progress, based on personal teaching experience to correctly identify immediate critical problem of the student, and consideration on the humanistic empathy interaction. Although the overall findings suggested that ChatGPT exhibited potential reliability and credibility for argumentation feedback, the study did identify several limitations.}

To assess heterogeneity in marijuana use among adolescent Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) subgroups.
Methods
AAPI high school students (n = 31,071) participating in the 2019–2020 California Student Tobacco Survey were categorized by race/ethnicity and examined for ever and current (past-30-day) marijuana use. Descriptive statistics were used to describe marijuana use and harm perceptions by subgroups. Multiple logistic regression was used to compare subgroups on marijuana use with other demographics as covariates.
Results
Current marijuana use rates by ethnic subgroups were: Chinese 4.2 %, Koreans 4.9 %, Indians 5.2 %, Vietnamese 6.0 %, Hmong 6.4 %, Pakistanis 6.6 %, Japanese 9.4 %, Filipinos 9.6 %, Cambodians 17.9 %, other monoethnic Asians 10.5 %, and Pacific Islanders 22.3 %. Current use rates for monoethnic, multiethnic, and multiracial AAPIs were 7.3 %, 9.1 %, and 18.5 %, respectively, with multiracial AAPIs using at a higher rate than monoethnic and multiethnic AAPIs (both p's < 0.001). Among AAPIs overall, 11.3 % currently used marijuana. Females currently used at a higher rate than males, 10.8 % vs. 9.6 % (p = .011). Ever and current marijuana use were negatively correlated with perceptions that everyday and occasional use is harmful (all p's < 0.001). Compared to Chinese students, all subgroups except Koreans and Pakistanis were more likely to use marijuana (all p's < 0.05), with Filipinos, Japanese, Cambodians, and Pacific Islanders more than twice as likely (all p's < 0.001).
Conclusions
There was substantial heterogeneity in marijuana use rates among ethnic subgroups of AAPI adolescents. Several AAPI subgroups used marijuana at elevated rates. Gender-based trendlines among AAPI adolescents have crossed.}

Disagreement persists regarding the cause of death in patients with tuberculosis (TB) between the national TB registry and vital registration statistics. This study investigated the disagreement and contributing factors between TB-related and non-TB-related deaths using an integrated national TB database in South Korea.
Methods
We identified a sub-set cohort of 29,033 patients with drug-susceptible TB registered between 2011 and 2020 who died during TB treatment. The cause of death was identified by the Korean National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (KNTSS) and Statistics Korea database. We performed a multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with the cause of death.
Results
The participants’ median age was 79 years (interquartile range, 70–85 years), with males comprising 63.2 %. Among the 29,033 deaths, 12,937 (44.6 %) and 6028 (20.8 %) were classified as TB-related deaths in Statistics Korea and KNTSS, respectively. The overall agreement rate for the cause of death between the two databases was 0.72 (95 % confidence interval, 0.71–0.72), increasing from 0.69 in 2011–0.77 in 2020. Among discrepant cases, 92.2 % (7545/8181) were classified as non-TB-related in KNTSS but as TB-related in Statistics Korea. Over the study period, the proportion of individuals classified as non-TB-related deaths in both databases and the agreement rate increased. In the multinomial analysis, age, sputum acid-fast bacilli smear, Charlson comorbidity index, and comorbidities, such as cancer and end-stage renal disease, showed distinguishing features across the cause of death groups.
Conclusions
Substantial disagreement on the cause of death persists between the national TB registry and vital registration statistics, though this decreased during the study period. Most disagreement likely indicates an underestimation of TB-related deaths in the TB registry. Age, sputum smear, and comorbidities were identifiable characteristics across groups that may influence the cause of death coding process.}

abstract = {Background
The lipomodeling technique has transformed the management of Poland syndrome-associated thoraco-mammary deformities. Complex type 3 cases with significant thoracic deformity often require a combined approach, including the latissimus dorsi flap, which is absent in about 10 % of cases. These patients face therapeutic challenges. The breast-pectoralis flap (BPF), developed for breast reconstruction, allows transfer of tissue from the contralateral breast. This study aimed to evaluate the BPF's contribution to correcting severe thoraco-mammary deformities in Poland syndrome and associated syndromes.
Materials and methods
We conducted a case series on five female patients aged 11–16 years between 2012 and 2024 to evaluate outcomes and complications of breast reconstruction using the BPF. Four had severe stage III Poland syndrome with marked thoracic deformity. One had sequelae from cystic lymphangioma treatment, lacking the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major muscles, corresponding to severe stage III Poland syndrome. Evaluation criteria included aesthetic results, patient satisfaction, functional impact, and the number of lipomodeling sessions needed.
Results
The BPF enabled thoraco-mammary restoration in all patients. Additional lipomodeling sessions achieved the desired morphological results. All outcomes were “very good,” with no flap necrosis or other complications. Patient satisfaction was rated “very good” in all cases.
Conclusion
The BPF is a valuable technique for treating severe thoraco-mammary deformities in Poland syndrome and should be part of the therapeutic arsenal for complex cases. However, it requires a delicate procedure by experienced plastic surgeons.}

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a keystone of the public health response to HIV, making the support of adherence a point of focus in research and service delivery. Over the past decade, measurements of viral suppression have increasingly been used to evaluate interventions, with more robust study designs gaining traction. Effective approaches include adherence counselling beyond ART education (including mental health and wellbeing approaches), reducing burden of care, tackling structural and societal determinants of health, and using mHealth platforms to deliver interventions. Increasingly, single-strategy interventions are giving way to multicomponent approaches to respond to nuances in adherence behaviour. However, determining which effective strategy to offer and to whom, when, and how remain pressing questions if professionals in the field (eg, researchers, clinicians, and community health workers) are to reach the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals in the recent context of decreased funding. As new long-acting treatments enter global formularies, interventions showing success with oral ART will probably remain relevant to inform service delivery in most contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an effective treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, patient breathing can affect treatment accuracy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a bi-polar (BP) gated motion management strategy for SBRT and evaluate its feasibility geometrically and dosimetrically.
Methods
The BP strategy involved instructing patients to hold their breath briefly at the end of both inhalation (EI) and exhalation (EE), with radiation delivered only during these breath-holding periods. Eight volunteers were included to evaluate breathing stability, repeatability, and patient comfort. Additionally, 15 patients were retrospectively studied to evaluate the geometric and dosimetric efficiency of BP in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) modes. BP plans were compared with four common breathing strategies: free breathing (FB), gating at the end of inhalation (GI), gating at the end of exhalation (GE), and real-time tracking (RT).
Results
Volunteers could comfortably hold their breath for >3 minutes, demonstrating good stability and repeatability. Geometrically, the ratio of BP's internal target volume (ITV) to GI's ITV was the smallest at 0.65, compared to 1.89 for FB, 1.05 for GE, and 0.68 for RT. In the dosimetric evaluation of IMRT plans, the lung V20Gy ratio for BP to GI was the smallest at 0.89. Similar trends were observed for VMAT plans.
Conclusions
The BP strategy is a feasible option for lung SBRT, offering reduced treatment volumes and normal tissue toxicity, with a high duty cycle and less technical complexity than other RT-based methods.}

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent an emerging technology that challenges individual technology user acceptance. Whereas AVs promise several advantages, their success is conditioned on public trust. AVs impact not only those who use them but also those who share the environment with them, such as bicyclists. Empirical research has been characterized by several competing constructs aimed at explaining AV receptivity. In this article, we (1) review extant research on the receptivity of AVs, and (2) develop and validate a model of AV receptivity. A cross-sectional survey of 219 bicyclists showed empirical support for the model. The model can be a useful tool for the AV industry and policymakers in need of assessing the likelihood of success for a wider AV diffusion and help them understand intervention strategies to address populations that may be less inclined to accept the new technology on public roads. We offer several recommendations for future research on refining the measurement instrument and enhancing our understanding of AV and autonomous technology receptivity.}

abstract = {Objective
We evaluated the contributions of chronological age, comorbidity burden, and/or frailty in predicting 90-day readmission in patients undergoing degenerative scoliosis surgery.
Methods
Patients were identified through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was assessed using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining indicator. Comorbidity was assessed using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were created to predict readmission using age, frailty, and/or ECI. Area under the curve (AUC) was compared using DeLong's test.
Results
A total of 8104 patients were identified. Readmission rate was 9.8%, with infection representing the most common cause (3.5%). Our first model utilized chronological age, ECI, and/or frailty as primary predictors. The combination of ECI + frailty + age performed best, but the inclusion of chronological age did not significantly improve performance compared to ECI + frailty alone (AUC 0.603 vs. 0.599, P = 0.290). A second model using only chronological age and frailty as primary predictors performed better, however the inclusion of chronological age worsened performance when compared to frailty alone (AUC 0.747 vs. 0.743, P = 0.043).
Conclusions
These data support frailty as a predictor of 90-day readmission within a nationally representative sample. Frailty alone performed better than combinations of ECI and age. Interestingly, the integration of chronological age did not dramatically improve the model's performance. Limitations include the use of a national registry and a single frailty index. This provides impetus to explore biological age, rather than chronological age, as a potential tool for surgical risk assessment.}

abstract = {Aims
The association of telomere length (TL) and coronary heart disease (CHD) is still debated, and there is a lack of dose-response meta-analyses on this issue. The aim is therefore to integrate existing evidence on the association between TL and CHD risk and explore the dose-response relationship between them.
Data synthesis
PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies up to September 2024. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with data presented as RRs and 95 % CIs. Restricted cubic splines were used to assess linear and nonlinear associations. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. Fourteen articles (8 prospective cohort studies, 2 case-cohort studies, 2 case-control studies, and 2 cross-sectional studies) were finally included in the meta-analysis, with a total sample size of 199,562 participants and 25,752 cases. For CHD, the total RR for the highest TL group compared to the lowest TL group was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.61, 0.78, I2 = 64.5 %). For every 1 kilobase pair (kbp) increase in TL, the CHD risk decreased by 23 % (RR = 0.77, 95 % CI: 0.69, 0.87, I2 = 89.0 %). The nonlinearity test indicated a linear association between TL and CHD risk (Pnon-linearity = 0.930). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust.
Conclusions
The meta-analysis showed a linear relationship between TL and CHD. People with low TL may be more likely to develop CHD than those with high TL. The association between the two did not change in a wide range of populations.}

abstract = {Background
It is well known that atrial fibrillation (AF) patients not receiving anticoagulants are at higher risk of Ischemic Stroke (IS).
Objective
Our objective is to estimate how much the Medicare program spends during one-year treating a Medicare beneficiary (MB) with AF who were not being anticoagulated prior to or during their IS hospitalization.
Methods
This cross-sectional study population consisted of all MBs in the fee-for-service program who were discharged from a hospitalization for IS having AF during 2018. Patients were excluded for a prior history of stroke or already receiving long-term anticoagulants. Medicare spending was defined as paid claims during the index hospitalization and all facility claims that began within 12-months of the index hospital discharge date even if admission occurred in 2019.
Results
The final sample was 50,509 MBs. Average Medicare Part A spending per beneficiary was $46,867 ± $49,212, for a total of nearly $2.5 billion. Highest average spending per MB was for hospital services $25,848, of which $15,790 ± $20,984 occurred during the index hospitalization, and $10,058 ± $21,956 for rehospitalization. The Medicare program average MB spending included $8131 ± $14,979 at skilled nursing facilities, $5538 ± $12,739 at rehabilitation facilities, and $3056 ± $7495 for outpatient facilities or emergency departments.
Conclusion
MBs with AF who are not treated with anticoagulants and then suffer an ischemic stroke result in one-year Medicare Part A program spending of approximately $47,000 per person compared to an average spending of approximately $12,800 per beneficiary in the Medicare program in 2018 [1]. Identification and anticoagulation treatment in AF could result in significant healthcare savings.}

Structural representations of bias using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a unified approach to conceptualize bias, distinguish between different types of bias, and identify ways to address bias. DAG-based data simulation further enhances the scope of this approach. Recently, DAGs have been used to demonstrate how missing eligibility information can compromise emulated target trial analysis, a cutting edge approach to estimate treatment effects using real-world data. The importance of simulation for methodological research has received substantial recognition in the past few years, and others have argued that simulating data based on DAGs can be especially helpful for understanding various epidemiological concepts. In the present work, we present two concrete examples of how simulations based on DAGs can be used to gain insights into issues commonly encountered in real-world analytics, i.e., regression modelling to address confounding bias, and the potential extent of selection bias. Increasing accessibility and extending the simulation algorithms of existing software to include longitudinal and time-to-event data are identified as priorities for further development. With such extensions, simulations based on DAGs would be an even more powerful tool to advance our understanding of the rapidly growing toolbox of real-world analytics.}

abstract = {Background
Myelomeningocele (MMC) disproportionately affects low-resource areas and regions without mandatory folic acid fortification. No specific literature exists on the distribution of research output regarding neurosurgical management of myelomeningocele worldwide in relation to regional disease burden. We aimed to examine the country of origin and patient population of published papers on MMC and topics related to neurosurgical management of MMC, to determine whether these were proportionate to disease burden.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted on neurosurgical aspects of MMC care. The geographic distribution of neurosurgical MMC research output was examined against the national burden of disease. Bibliometric analysis quantified author and patient country affiliations stratified by World Bank income group classification and folic acid fortification status, juxtaposed with disease burden.
Results
From 9692 titles, 1843 were included, representing 107,446 patients and 2650 authorship instances. High-income countries (HICs) constituted 3% of 2019's global neural tube defect (NTD) births, 74% of authorships, and 83% of patients represented. Upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) represented 9% of NTD births, 16% of authorships, and 9% of published patients. Lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) represented 55% of NTD births but only 8.6% of authorships and 7% of patients. Low-income countries (LICs) shouldered 32% of NTD births and contributed 1.3% of authorships and 1.6% of patients. Countries with mandatory folic acid fortification represented 75% of patients and 54% of authorships. Postnatal repair, hydrocephalus, and postoperative complications were the most frequently studied topics.
Conclusions
The global literature concerning neurosurgical management of myelomeningocele originates predominantly from HICs. Published experiences of myelomeningocele patients from LICs/LMICs are scarce, even though they constitute the majority of the affected population. Neurosurgeons and other health professionals must address this mismatch between disease burden and publication volume in order to inform practice, policy, and advocacy for MMC care worldwide.}

Glycerol, a by-product of the biodiesel industry, has garnered attention as a substrate for sustainable bioprocessing. This study investigates the metabolic adaptability of a newly isolated strain, Klebsiella variicola JYP01, focusing on glycerol utilization under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as the potential of this strain as a proficient producer of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) in sustainable bioprocessing. The research explores the potential of K. variicola JYP01 as the efficient PDO producers with the emphasis on the integration of zero-valent iron (ZVI) to enhance energy production and PDO yield.
Methods
Isolation and characterization of the JYP01 strain, assessing its growth and PDO production under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and incorporating ZVI (as an electron donor) to identify the metabolic fluxes. Several analyses, including 16S rRNA analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and bio-electrochemical system reactors, were employed to elucidate metabolic strategies and the bioconversion efficiency of glycerol to PDO of JYP01 particularly with ZVI.
Significant findings
The integration of ZVI into the bioconversion process significantly enhanced PDO production, leading to 171 % increase from 44.0 mM to 75.2 mM. This demonstrates the distinct ability of the K. variicola JYP01 strain to utilize ZVI as an extra reducing energy in an anaerobic environment. The findings underscore this strain's metabolic capacity, its suitability for glycerol conversion on a large scale, and the novel strategy of using ZVI to elevate PDO production, advancing sustainable bioprocessing techniques.}

Biological liver support systems, incorporate functional hepatocytes to partially restore hepatic metabolic functions, though clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit.

Continuous renal replacement therapy, while not specific for liver failure, is essential in patients with severe hyperammonemia or acute kidney injury, aiding in ammonia clearance and fluid balance control. Plasma exchange (PE) has promising detoxification and immunomodulatory effects, improving survival in ALF. In ACLF, PE may reduce systemic inflammation, though evidence remains limited.

Resumen
La insuficiencia hepática, ya sea aguda (IHA) o aguda sobre crónica (ACLF), se caracteriza por disfunción hepatocelular, inflamación sistémica y fallo multiorgánico, con una alta mortalidad en ausencia de trasplante hepático (TH). Sin embargo, el TH está limitado por la escasez de órganos y contraindicaciones médicas, lo que ha motivado el desarrollo de terapias de soporte extracorpóreo. Los sistemas de soporte hepático biológico, diseñados para restaurar funciones metabólicas mediante hepatocitos funcionales, no se utilizan actualmente en la práctica clínica. Entre los sistemas artificiales, técnicas como MARS y Prometheus permiten la eliminación de toxinas unidas a albúmina, aunque su uso ha disminuido y no han demostrado beneficio en la supervivencia. La terapia de reemplazo renal continua es útil en pacientes con hiperamoniemia o lesión renal aguda. El intercambio plasmático ha demostrado beneficios en la IHA y podría tener un rol en el ACLF.

abstract = {Generative Pre-trained Transformers like ChatGPT are examples of AI systems which produce human-like responses in different forms such as text or images that have demonstrated excellent performance in producing logical and contextually relevant answers. However, the false positive/negative detection of generative AI has been noted as a challenge. In this article, statistical experiments are conducted to test the chances of false positive and false negative detection of AI-generated text. It was found that the detected likelihoods of generative AI in articles’ abstracts is much lower than that found in paragraphs taken from the literature section of the selected articles. This means that literature parts have higher likelihoods to falsely demonstrate AI-generated text. On the other hand, when genuine texts are compared with AI-generated texts, it is observed that there is a noticeable margin of overlap between their distributions and therefore type I and type II errors fall within the realm of possibility. We show that despite these challenges, generative AI like ChatGPT continues to be a promising tool for communication and information retrieval. However, it is vital to address the concerns regarding false detection of AI generated text and ensure that these models are used in ethical and responsible conduct.}

Interestingly, a clear separation was observed between the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization curves under low magnetic field of 0.01 T. Furthermore, the crystal exhibited a long-time relaxation behavior at 4 K. The freezing temperature increases with frequency increasing. Additionally, we explored the response of the crystal to DC magnetization and AC susceptibility under different pressure conditions, up to 1.58 GPa. The crystal exhibits three anomalies TC = 22.0 K, T1 = 20.5 K and TN = 11.0 K under ambient pressure. An analysis of the anisotropy of the spin-glass-like behavior in the crystal was conducted, with a specific focus on the a-axis as the preferred direction of magnetization.

In brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI), children with upper trunk injuries have multidirectional movement deficits, including global abduction and hand-to-neck, hand-to-abdomen, and hand-to-spine movements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of pericoracoid tissue release and postoperative structured physiotherapy as a first-step intervention to reduce the multidirectional movement deficit in children with BPBI.
Methods
Thirty-four children with BPBI underwent pericoracoid tissue release, including coracohumeral and coracoacromial ligament release, pectoralis minor release, and coracoid process osteotomy. Patients were followed up with regular physiotherapy and a home exercise program for 1 year after surgery. Before surgery and at 3 and 12 months after surgery, upper-extremity function was measured using the modified Mallet classification and Active Movement Scale, passive shoulder and elbow joint movements were measured using goniometry, and the difference in the distance between the treatment table and the acromion was measured.
Results
There was an improvement in all movement tasks evaluated with modified Mallet classification, and there was increased shoulder flexion, abduction, and external and internal rotation movements as evaluated with Active Movement Scale. Increased passive joint movements were noted in abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation movements with the arm next to the body and with the limb in 90° abduction. There was a decrease in the distance difference between the acromion and the treatment table between both sides.
Conclusions
Pericoracoid tissue release provided multidirectional improvement in shoulder joint movements in children with BPBI.

This paper introduces an innovative spatio-temporal fusion framework that combines graph convolutional network (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) models. By capturing and merging spatio-temporal features from relevant events, the proposed GCN-LSTM model achieves remarkable accuracy in predicting terrorist attacks. The experimental results demonstrate outstanding performance, with the model attaining minimal RMSE and MAE values of 0.037 and 0.031, respectively, surpassing all baseline models (LSTM, GCN, and CNN-LSTM-Transformer). Through its effective interpretation of complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying terrorist attacks, our model substantially enhances the predictive accuracy across diverse time horizons.

abstract = {Objectives
The nature of paramedic workflows, where paramedics are responsible to provide care and chart concurrently, can result in incomplete or non-existent patient care reports on patient handover to the emergency department (ED). Charting delays and retrospective recollection of care may lead to patient information gaps, which can increase ED workload, cause care delays, and increase the risk of adverse events. Speech recognition documentation technology has the potential to produce complete patient care reports quicker and improve paramedic-to-ED handover. We performed a scoping review to determine paramedic perceptions and user requirements for speech recognition documentation technology.
Methods
MEDLINE, Google Scholar, IEEE Explore, ProQuest, and CINAHL were searched from 2014 to March 2024. Criteria included studies focused on paramedics’ use or perceptions of speech recognition documentation technology. This review included studies conducted in the prehospital environment and adjacent agencies (i.e., ED, fire, police, military).
Results
The review identified eight articles that met inclusion criteria. All eight articles were small focus group-based studies in laboratory settings published on or after 2020. Five studies were conducted in the United States, two in Switzerland, and one in Japan. Of the eight studies, five recommended further live environment testing of the technology examined, and three underscored the importance of a user-centred design. The top user requirements for speech recognition adoption was hands-free use, noise reduction technology, battery life, and word accuracy. All eight studies recommended further research and development of speech recognition documentation technology in the prehospital workflow.
Conclusion
This scoping review has highlighted that while there is a growing interest in speech recognition documentation technology in the paramedicine workflow, more research is needed, especially with larger samples in a live environment. The user requirements and perceptions of speech recognition documentation technology in paramedicine must be better understood to design systems with high adoption rates.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical risk prediction models integrated into digitized health care informatics systems hold promise for personalized primary prevention and care, a core goal of precision health. Fairness metrics are important tools for evaluating potential disparities across sensitive features, such as sex and race or ethnicity, in the field of prediction modeling. However, fairness metric usage in clinical risk prediction models remains infrequent, sporadic, and rarely empirically evaluated.
Objective
We seek to assess the uptake of fairness metrics in clinical risk prediction modeling through an empirical evaluation of popular prediction models for 2 diseases, 1 chronic and 1 infectious disease.
Methods
We conducted a scoping literature review in November 2023 of recent high-impact publications on clinical risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVID-19 using Google Scholar.
Results
Our review resulted in a shortlist of 23 CVD-focused articles and 22 COVID-19 pandemic–focused articles. No articles evaluated fairness metrics. Of the CVD-focused articles, 26% used a sex-stratified model, and of those with race or ethnicity data, 92% had study populations that were more than 50% from 1 race or ethnicity. Of the COVID-19 models, 9% used a sex-stratified model, and of those that included race or ethnicity data, 50% had study populations that were more than 50% from 1 race or ethnicity. No articles for either disease stratified their models by race or ethnicity.
Conclusions
Our review shows that the use of fairness metrics for evaluating differences across sensitive features is rare, despite their ability to identify inequality and flag potential gaps in prevention and care. We also find that training data remain largely racially and ethnically homogeneous, demonstrating an urgent need for diversifying study cohorts and data collection. We propose an implementation framework to initiate change, calling for better connections between theory and practice when it comes to the adoption of fairness metrics for clinical risk prediction. We hypothesize that this integration will lead to a more equitable prediction world.}

To evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of three Artificial intelligence (AI) models—GPT-4o, Canva-GPT, and ECG Reader-GPT—against emergency medicine specialists (EMSs) in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation using a standardized and validated test set.
Methods
In this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, 50 ECG questions were selected from the reference text 150 ECG Cases. Thirty EMSs completed the test once; each AI model was evaluated on the same test set daily over 30 consecutive days. Diagnostic accuracy was compared across predefined ECG subcategories and clinical case types.
Results
EMSs achieved the highest overall diagnostic accuracy (median: 41.5; IQR: 37.0–43.0), followed closely by ECG Reader-GPT (median: 39.5; IQR: 39.0–41.0), with no statistically significant difference between them (p = 0.530). ECG Reader-GPT significantly outperformed both GPT-4o and Canva-GPT across all case categories (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that ECG Reader-GPT performed comparably to EMSs in identifying ischemic syndromes, channelopathies and genetic syndromes, and normal ECGs (all p < 0.05); it surpassed them in interpreting rhythm disorders (p = 0.007).
Conclusion
ECG Reader-GPT, a customized AI model for ECG interpretation, demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to experienced EMSs and significantly outperformed general-purpose models across all ECG subcategories. These findings highlight the value of domain specialization in developing clinically effective AI tools.}

Treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) differs based on MI type, which can be difficult to determine in the emergency department. This study sought to evaluate whether a machine learning algorithm (MI3) in combination with N-Terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) can accurately differentiate MI type.
Methods
We conducted a secondary analysis of the multisite CMR-IMPACT trial, which prospectively enrolled adults with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and an initial indeterminate troponin. Patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of MI and an initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI; Abbott Laboratories) measure were included. Incidence of MI and MI type were adjudicated by expert reviewers. Receiver operator characteristic curves for MI-type were created and area under the curve (AUC) calculated for MI3 and MI3 with NT-proBNP and Gal-3. AUCs were compared using DeLong’s method.
Results
Among 123 patients with adjudicated MI, the mean age was 60±12 years and 37.4% (46/123) were female. Type 1 MI occurred in 58.5% (72/123) and type 2 MI in 41.5% (51/123). MI3 based on an initial hs-cTnI yielded an AUC of 0.704 (95% CI 0.611-0.797) for MI type. When combined with NT-proBNP and Gal-3, AUC improved to 0.789 (95% CI 0.709-0.869, p=0.0165). In patients with serial hs-cTnIs (n = 86), the AUC of MI3 for MI type was 0.721 (95% CI 0.614-0.829) and increased to 0.797 (95% CI 0.700-0.894, p=0.09) with the addition of NT-proBNP and Gal-3.
Conclusion
Adding NT-proBNP and Gal-3 to the MI3 machine learning algorithm shows promise in differentiating type 1 from type 2 MI.}

Lifestyle interventions (LIs) are the cornerstone for obesity management. The Mayo Clinic Diet (MCD) offers two approaches for LIs: the In-Person LI (IPLI) and the Digital Enhanced LI (DELI). The IPLI includes a 2-day in-person program with monthly follow-ups, whereas the DELI provides on-demand digital tools. The comparative efficacy of these approaches is currently unknown.
Methods
This retrospective study included two cohorts of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2 and weight metrics at least 3 months after starting either the IPLI or DELI program. The primary endpoint was the total body weight loss percentage (TBWL%) at 6 months.
Results
The study included 133 participants in the IPLI cohort (mean age 46.3 years, 65.4 % female, BMI 36.4) and 9603 in the DELI cohort (mean age 60.1 years, 85.0 % female, BMI 33.1).

In pharmacy research, LLMs have demonstrated potential utility, though challenges regarding response reproducibility, inconsistent accuracy, and information privacy persist. While LLMs can generate functional code, the usefulness of this capability for pharmacists remains underexplored. This commentary presents a practical example of how a pharmacist, drawing on digital competency, engaged with ChatGPT to create tools that support specific practice tasks, by requesting code. These include a calculator for pharmacokinetic parameters, volume and weight-based calculators, drug-drug interaction checks from a custom data table, and a hyperlink webpage tool to support multilingual translation of consumer medicines information documents. The tools were created through iterative prompting and are presented as functional prototypes, each of which passed a pilot functionality test. This commentary encourages pharmacists to enhance their digital competence to explore practice-relevant innovation through engagement with generative AI. It also highlights the value clinicians may gain through initiating such explorations as a foundation for potential collaboration with technology experts. Finally, the commentary discusses regulatory considerations related to pharmacists’ tool creation using AI, including issues on information privacy and task responsibility. Clinicians who actively leverage their digital competency to engage with AI may contribute to shaping the future of digital support tools within pharmacy practice while advancing their professional roles in the evolving landscape of healthcare technology.}

Materials and methods
Discharge summaries were compiled, and patient information was deidentified in a Python-based program. Prompts were engineered in GPT-4 to assess for the presence of postoperative complications. GPT-4 was further asked to interpret each complication's Clavien-Dindo classification and institutional-specific category. GPT-4's database was compared to a human-curated database. Discrepancies were manually reviewed to calculate match and accuracy rates.

Approximately 944 renal surgeries were conducted from August 2005 to March 2022. There was a 79.6% match rate between GPT-4 and human-curated data in detecting postoperative complications. Accuracy rates were 86.7% for GPT-4 and 92.9% for human-curated. A subgroup of 139 patients had a complication detected by both GPT-4 and human with available Clavien-Dindo classification and category information. There was a 37.4% overall match rate for Clavien-Dindo grade and 55.4% match rate for category.
Conclusions
GPT-4 was able to accurately detect if there were any postoperative complications. It struggled with the complex task of further analyzing complications, especially with Clavien-Dindo classification, which requires more critical thinking and interpretation. While GPT-4 is not yet ready for advanced postoperative complication analysis, it can still be used to support clinicians in this endeavor.}

abstract = {Background
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by high relapse and mortality rates. Our previous investigation identified enoyl-CoA hydratase domain-containing protein 3 (ECHDC3) as being of prognostic significance in AML; however, the underlying pathways remain elusive. The intricate crosstalk among genetic abnormalities, metabolic pathways, and protein dysfunctions underpins the complexity contributing to its poor prognosis.
Methods
ECHDC3 was knocked down by siRNA and subjected to RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and metabolomic assessments. Cell culture media were subjected to metabolomic assessments to evaluate changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. Mass spectrometry was conducted on bone marrow leukemia stem cells (CD34+) from chemotherapy-sensitive (S) and chemotherapy-resistant (R) patients. Additionally, untargeted metabolomic sequencing was performed on bone marrow supernatants from this patient cohort, and a combined proteomic-metabolomic analysis was conducted on the sequencing results from paired samples.
Results
Knockdown of ECHDC3 significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (p < 0.0001), increased the mitochondrial DNA copy number MT-CO1 (p = 0.0367) and MT-CO2 (p = 0.0081), and enhanced manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity (p = 0.0003). Significant differences were observed in choline metabolism in cancer (p = 0.0063), linoleic acid (p = 0.0160), and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism (p = 0.0250) between the R and S groups. Furthermore, correlation analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data suggested that choline and glycerophospholipid metabolism may play pivotal roles in the development of chemotherapy resistance in AML.
Conclusions
ECHDC3 contributes to chemotherapy resistance in AML by regulating mitochondrial function, autophagy, and metabolic pathways. This study highlights ECHDC3 as a potential therapeutic target and offers insights into the development of AML treatments to overcome drug resistance.}

abstract = {Objective
We tested the potential of circulating galectin-1, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) levels at baseline in individuals with knee pain as biomarkers for development of radiographic knee and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA).
Design
This study comprised 212 individuals with knee pain from the Halland osteoarthritis cohort (HALLOA). Clinical characteristics and serum/plasma levels of galectin-1, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha were measured at baseline, and knee and hand radiographs were obtained at a two-year follow-up. The predictive value of circulating inflammatory markers and clinical variables at baseline was assessed using multinominal logistic regression for those who developed radiographic OA in knees only (n ​= ​25), in hands only (n ​= ​40), and in both knees and hands (n ​= ​43); the group who did not develop OA (n ​= ​104) was used as reference. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
Results
As expected, age was identified as a risk factor for having radiographic knee and/or hand OA at the two-year follow-up. Baseline circulating galectin-1 levels did not associate with developing radiographic knee OA but associated with developing radiographic hand OA (odds ratio (OR) for a 20% increased risk: 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.29) and both radiographic knee and hand OA (OR for a 20% increased risk: 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.30). However, baseline IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha did not associate with developing radiographic knee and/or hand OA.
Conclusion
Non-age adjusted circulating galectin-1 is superior to IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha in predicting radiographic hand but not knee OA.}

abstract = {Background
Hearing loss affects an estimated 30 million individuals in the United States significantly affecting communication, social engagement, and overall quality of life. In August 2022, the Food and Drug Administration published its final rule creating a regulatory category for over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Few studies have assessed pharmacists’ readiness to provide patient support for these devices.
Objective
This qualitative study assessed pharmacist adoption and sustainable implementation of pharmacist-provided OTC hearing aids.
Methods
Community pharmacists were invited to participate in focus groups through self-selection via electronic invitations sent from the institution’s continuing professional development e-mail listserv. An interview guide was developed based on selected constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed interviews and coded by investigators. Focus groups were conducted until a point of saturation was reached (4 focus groups, 23 participants). Qualitative results spanned all 5 CFIR domains.
Results
Pharmacists viewed convenience and accessibility as major advantages offered by OTC hearing aids and felt the sale of OTC hearing aids fit logically within existing pharmacy workflow. However, they cited a lack of knowledge, skills, and training on the subject and devices, which influenced their reported lack of motivation and commitment to engage in selling OTC hearing aids. Pharmacists expressed frustration with the complex nature of these devices, noting significant variances in quality, technological sophistication, and cost.
Conclusion
Findings from our study clearly indicate a need for training and education opportunities for pharmacists who offer or will offer OTC hearing aids. Establishing a collaborative relationship with audiologists may help bridge the gap in knowledge and skills for pharmacists.}

abstract = {Background
Neuromyths are prevalent in counseling and counselor education, potentially promoting harmful, unproven methods. This study examines the factors that predict the prevalence of neuromyths among counselors.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 415 participants, including counselors-in-training, practitioners, educators, and supervisors. The survey measured neuromyth endorsement using a 15-item questionnaire and assessed demographic characteristics, neuroscience knowledge, and the use of nine information sources. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of neuromyths.
Results
Predictors accounted for 9.0% of the variation in neuromyths (F = 4.775, p < .001). Counselors with higher educational levels endorsed fewer neuromyths compared to those with bachelor’s degrees. The use of books was associated with fewer neuromyths (β = .144, p < .01), whereas reliance on TV predicted higher neuromyth endorsement (β = -.187, p < .001).
Conclusion
Promoting accurate neuroscience knowledge through credible sources can reduce neuromyths in the counseling profession.}
