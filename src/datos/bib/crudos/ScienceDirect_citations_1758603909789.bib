Introduction
Chatbot Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT), a multimodal generative AI, has been studied for potential applications in healthcare, including otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. In this study, authors investigates the consistency of ChatGPT-4o in analyzing clinical fiberoptic videos of suspected laryngeal malignancies compared to expert clinicians.
Methods
This experimental study involved twenty patients with primary laryngeal disease consulting at a tertiary academic center. Data, including laryngeal fiberoptic video examinations, were retrospectively analyzed using the ChatGPT-4o application programming interface. Responses were assessed for diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and clinical recommendations. Three otolaryngology-head and neck consultants independently evaluated ChatGPT-4o’s performance using the Artificial Intelligence Performance Instrument and a five-point Likert scale for complexity and consistency.
Results
ChatGPT-4o identified malignant diagnoses as the primary diagnosis in 30% of cases, while proposing malignancies as one of the top three diagnoses in 90% of cases. Despite high sensitivity, specificity was limited. The mean consistency score for image analysis was 2.36 ± 1.13, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.890 (P = 0.03). The model showed a tendency to prioritize text over visual data, limiting the improvement in diagnostic accuracy from video input.
Conclusion
While ChatGPT-4o demonstrates potential in analyzing laryngeal pathologies through multimodal data, current limitations in specificity and image interpretation indicate the need for further refinement. Ongoing advancements could enhance its integration into clinical workflows, supporting accurate diagnoses and decision-making in otolaryngology.}

In the study, a content analysis was conducted on the curriculum of 65 undergraduate tourism and hospitality management programs, followed by an analysis of data from 28 academics to explore the role of emerging technologies in the curriculum. We have observed six core topics. Technology courses had the lowest proportion. We further observe four categories of skills that emerging technologies may provide students, highlighting their potential to shape future career opportunities. Building on these findings, the current study contributes to the literature by linking these skill sets — digital and technological, theoretical, operational, and managerial — to emerging job roles such as virtual reality tour designers, competent tourism developers, and AI-driven marketing specialists. Furthermore, the study identifies the domains where emerging technologies have the most relevance and outlines which purpose they may be included in the tourism and hospitality curriculum as a course. Thus, it forwards previous studies emphasizing the importance of emerging technologies. The study also suggests the implications for the literature, practice, and public policies.}

Difficulty removing central venous ports in children is generally uncommon. We present a rare case of intraoperative difficulty with port removal that resulted in catheter breakage.
Case presentation
An 18-year-old girl presented for port removal nearly six years after placement. The catheter was stuck intraoperatively and despite increased tension, proximal dissection, and extraction attempts with a wire, a portion of the catheter broke off intravascularly. Since intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed that neither end of the catheter had free intravascular motion, the catheter was left in place. The patient has had no apparent complications from this retained portion of the catheter.
Conclusion
It is uncommon to have great difficulty removing a port in a child but in cases where the catheter is stuck, multiple techniques can be attempted intraoperatively to improve chances of removal. If the catheter breaks intraoperatively but has no free intravascular motion on fluoroscopy, it may be reasonable to leave the retained fragment in place and obtain interval imaging to ensure the fragment has not moved.}

Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are artificial intelligence programs designed to interpret and respond to text based input These programs can improve output based on prompting and tailored prompt engineering. Multiple studies have assessed the ability of various LLMs to perform on medical exams at different levels of training. The newest version of ChatGPT, GPT-4, allows image recognition which is relevant for many questions on orthopedic surgery exams. Performance of GPT-4, and the potential for LLMs to learn from prior exams remains unclear. The present study analyzed ChatGPT-4 performance on the 2023 hand surgery Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Self-Assessment Examination (SAE) before and after prompting with 5 previous versions of the test. It was hypothesized that GPT-4 would pass the exam and improve performance after prompting.
Methods
GPT-4 was tested with all text and image-based questions from the 2023 hand surgery SAE. Video-based questions were excluded. GPT-4 was then provided with questions, answers, and explanations from 5 previous SAEs from 2014 to 2020 and retested on the 2023 SAE text and imaging questions. Responses from GPT-4 on prompted and unprompted tests were recorded and compared.
Results
Both prompted and unprompted versions of ChatGPT-4 exceeded SAE exam passing requirement of >50 % correct response rate. GPT-4 answered 67 % of all questions correctly unprompted and 71 % of all questions correctly after prompting (p = 0.51). Sub-analysis demonstrated GPT-4 answered 66 % of image-based questions correctly after prompting, compared to 56 % before prompting (p = 0.25). GPT-4 answered 75 % of text only questions correctly before prompting and 74 % correctly after prompting (p = 1.0). Fischer's exact test on total questions, image only, and text only showed no statistically significant differences between prompted and unprompted versions of GPT-4.
Conclusion
GPT-4 demonstrated the ability to analyze orthopedic information, answer specialty-specific questions, and exceed the passing threshold of 50 % on the 2023 Hand Surgery Self-Assessment Exam. However, prompting GPT-4 with previous SAEs did not statistically significantly improve performance. With continued advancements in AI and deep learning, large language models may someday become resources in test simulation and knowledge checks in the realm of hand surgery.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment. Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.
Objective
This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.
Methods
We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.
Results
Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.
Conclusions
Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.}

abstract = {Introduction
We are currently developing a cell classification system intended for routine histopathology. During observation, cells of interest are added to a deep learning (DL) network, which after training classifies the remaining cells of interest with high and immediately validatable accuracy. In this study, we identify the optimal histological microsection thickness for this process and describe in high detail the morphological differences introduced by variation in microsection thickness.
Method
From HE-stained digitized sections of liver cut manually at 5 thicknesses and on an automated microtome (DS), hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were manually annotated and loaded into a DL convolutional neural network (ResNet). The network was trained at different settings to identify the thickness with optimal relation between number of training cells and validation accuracy. To shed interpretable light on the impact of thickness, exhaustive morphological details of the annotated cells were quantified and the differences between hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were analyzed with random forest.
Results
Classifying hepatocytes from DS sections clearly resulted in highest validation accuracy with least number of cells and for the remaining thicknesses a trend towards thin sections being more efficient was observed. Random forest analysis generally identified variations in nuclear granularity as the most important features in distinguishing cells. In DS and the thinner tissue sections, nuclear granularity features were more distinguished.
Conclusion
Microsections cut with DS in particular and thin sections in general are better suited for the intended cell classification system.}

The dataset was curated through the running of a prototyping hackathon designed to assess the abilities and performance of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the early stages of engineering design. This assessment involved comparing ChatGPT's performance to that of experienced engineering students in a hackathon setting, where participants competed by making a prototype that fires a NERF dart as far as possible. In this setup, all ideas, concepts, strategies, and actions undertaken by the AI-controlled team were autonomously generated by the ChatGPT, without human intervention or guidance, but implemented by two participants. Five self-directed baseline teams competed against the AI team. The dataset comprises 116 prototype entries and 433 edges (connection) that enable comparative analysis of design practices and performance between the team instructed solely by generative AI and baseline teams of experienced engineering design students. Prototypes and their attribute data were captured using Pro2booth, an online prototype capture platform running on participants' phones and computers. The dataset includes a transcript of the conversation between ChatGPT and the team responsible for implementing its recommendations, featuring 97 exchanges of prompts and responses. It contains the initial prompt used to instruct the AI, the objective and rules of the hackathon and the objective performance of teams, showing the ChatGPT team finishing 2nd among six teams. To the authors' knowledge, the TrollLabs Open dataset is the first and only open resource that directly compares the performance of generative AI with human teams in an engineering design context. Thus, it is intended to be a valuable resource to design researchers, engineering and design students, educators, and industry professionals seeking to find strategies for implementing generative AI tools in their design processes. By offering a comprehensive data collection, the dataset enables external researchers to conduct in-depth analyses that could highlight the practical implications of integrating generative AI in design practices, possibly providing an overview of its limitations and presenting recommendations for improved integration in the design process.}

abstract = {This study examines the role of higher education students’ perceptions in adapting Generative AI (GenAI) tools for teaching and learning, with a particular focus on the factors that influence student satisfaction and engagement. A comparative approach is adopted, exploring student experiences at Zayed University (ZU) in the UAE and King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Saudi Arabia. The principal variables of interest, including Expected Benefits (EB), University Support (US), Ethical Awareness (EA), and Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE), are examined, with particular attention to their direct and mediated influences through Behavioral Intention (BI) on student satisfaction (SS). Data were collected through surveys and analyzed using SmartPLS-4. The findings reveal notable similarities and differences between the two universities. At both ZU and KAU, BI demonstrated the strongest direct influence on SS, confirming its central role. EB and TSE significantly impacted SS both directly and indirectly through BI in both contexts, although their effects were stronger at KAU. Conversely, US and EA showed no significant direct or mediated effects on SS at either institution. R2 values indicated substantial explanatory power of the model, and Q2 values confirmed strong predictive relevance. These results suggest that while the core drivers (BI, EB, TSE) are consistent across contexts, institutional and cultural factors shape their relative impact. The findings highlight the importance of integrating GenAI tools into teaching practices and emphasize the role of student motivation, confidence, and institutional support in fostering effective adoption and enhancing learning experiences. Institutions should prioritize enhancing students' perceived benefits and technological self-efficacy by providing practical training and demonstrating the value of GenAI tools. These factors significantly influence student satisfaction and engagement, particularly in culturally distinct settings.}

Demand for mental health services exceeds available resources globally, and access to diagnosis and evidence-based treatment is affected by long delays. Digital mental health technologies present an opportunity to reimagine the delivery of mental health support by providing innovative, effective, and tailored approaches that meet people's individual preferences and goals. These technologies also present new challenges, however, and efforts must be made to ensure they are safe and effective. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have launched a partnership, funded by Wellcome, that explores regulation and evaluation of digital mental health technologies. This Viewpoint describes a series of key challenges across the regulatory and health technology assessment pathways and aims to facilitate discussions to ensure that approaches to regulation and evaluation are informed by patients, the public, and professionals working within mental health. We invite partners from across the mental health community to engage with, collaborate with, and provide scrutiny of this project to ensure it delivers the best possible outcomes.}

abstract = {Purpose
The research aims to unravel the dynamics of academic integrity in the ChatGPT era by analyzing critical predictors such as personal best goals (PBG), academic competence and workplace stress. Furthermore, it examines how ChatGPT adoption acts as a moderating factor, potentially influencing the relationship between these predictors and academic integrity, offering a nuanced understanding of its impact in academic settings.
Design/methodology/approach
Relying on the social cognitive theory, the authors adopt a quantitative approach through an online survey to explore the impact of key variables – PBG, academic competence and workplace stress, as well as ChatGPT adoption on integrity – by analyzing data from responses collected through Academic Social Networking Sites.
Findings
The study found that PBG related positively to academic integrity among academic staff. However, workplace stress had a negative impact on academic integrity, while academic competence failed to report any effect. With the integration of ChatGPT adoption as a moderator into the model, the authors found the association between PBG and academic integrity altered to be negative. The ChatGPT adoption-moderated interactions of academic competence and workplace stress on academic integrity were significant.
Practical implications
The findings suggest that institutions should provide training on the ethical and effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT to ensure they support rather than hinder academic integrity. Additionally, organizations should focus on stress management initiatives and fostering a balanced approach to personal goal setting to mitigate the potential negative impacts of ChatGPT adoption on ethical behavior.
Originality/value
This attempt is both timely and pioneering, addressing a clear gap in the current body of literature. As limited studies have examined the role of ChatGPT in academic settings, this work stands out as one of the earliest to investigate how educators and researchers incorporate OpenAI tools into their professional practices.}

abstract = {Objective
Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is advisable to promote better prognosis. The Mini-TEA scale was conceived as a sensitive screening for ASD among children. The authors aimed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the scale in a wider population.
Method
279 children from 2.5 to 12 yo were recruited, most of them under evaluation for possible ASD in the APAE of Passo Fundo/RS, as well as children with other diagnoses and normal children. Their parents/relatives answered the 48 binary questions (yes/no) of the Mini-TEA scale, divided into 15 items, which resulted in a score from 0 to 15. After that, the children were evaluated regarding the diagnostic criteria of ASD by experienced raters (gold standard) who had previously submitted to a concordance test and remained unaware of the children’s scores. Sensitivity and specificity Figs. were obtained. Factor analysis and Item Response Theory approaches were used for validity evidence.
Results
115 children were diagnosed with ASD. Scores ≥9 had 98.3 % of sensitivity and 62.2 % of specificity for the diagnosis. Two cases with the typical presentation of Asperger’s syndrome scored lower than 9. The mean time for screening was about 8.5 min. The validation model presented excellent coefficients of factorability. The analysis showed that the total variance of the scores of the scale through the 15 items was explained only by the set of ASD symptoms (unidimensionality).
Conclusion
The Mini-TEA scale is a very sensitive tool to screen for ASD and has high internal consistency for assessing typical autistic symptoms.}

This has created the need for transformative change in the agricultural sector, with soil health playing a key role in this transition. Soil health is essential for agricultural productivity, economic viability, and ecosystem resilience, while also advancing sustainability and inclusivity. Achieving these outcomes depends on effective soil management, but slow growth in fertilizer use and limited understanding of its efficiency by farmers pose significant challenges. The Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit (Nairobi, May 2024) underscored the urgency of these challenges, endorsing the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan. This commentary outlines key considerations for successful implementation of the plan, highlighting enabling conditions and strategic approaches: (1) trusted multi-sectoral partnerships fostering collaboration among farmers, governments, private companies, non-governmental organisations, and donors, (2) demand-driven research and development with strong focus on measurable development outcomes, (3) targeted investments and finance effectively expanding the role of the private sector, (4) effective policy mandates relying on comprehensive policy mixes, and (5) inclusive capacity-building using gender-transformative approaches. These strategic contributions are essential to achieving sustainable, equitable agricultural transformation in Africa. The transformation will demand innovation, long-term commitment, and coordinated action across sectors to ensure impact beyond the timeframe of the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan.}

Production of hydrogen directly on floating wind turbines is a scalable and modular approach to harnessing these wind resources. This paper presents a design for a floating 15 MW semi-submersible offshore turbine integrated with electrolyzers for hydrogen production and storage tanks. The modified configuration's hydrodynamic performance is simulated under combined aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading conditions. The modifications led to a 4–5 % increase in pitch and roll inertia of the platform. The maximum acceleration at the nacelle increased by less than 10 %, remaining within acceptable limits, and the maximum power output changed by less than 2 % across all load cases. Mooring line tensions increased by approximately 3 %, demonstrating minimal impact on overall stability.

Duodenum inversum is a rare congenital anatomical variant and presents a myriad of clinical challenges. This case presentation highlights a unique case of symptomatic duodenum inversum diagnosed in the second decade of life requiring operative intervention.
Case presentation
We present the case of a thirteen-year-old male who presented with one year of intermittent abdominal pain with associated bilious emesis. Diagnostic work-up included multiple abdominal ultrasounds and abdominal radiographs which only revealed constipation. Despite adequate bowel regimen, patient's symptoms persisted. Duodenum inversum was diagnosed on a fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal study and the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room to evaluate for concurrent midgut volvulus and malrotation. A diagnostic laparoscopy revealed fibrotic adhesive bands contributing to partial duodenal obstruction. Surgical resection of these bands alleviated the obstruction and resolved the patient's symptoms with no recurrence noted on post-operative follow-up.
Conclusion
In cases of duodenum inversum, recognition through diagnostic tools like fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal studies is critical. While initial medical management may suffice for mild cases, surgical intervention remains the cornerstone for severe cases, particularly when obstruction is evident, emphasizing the necessity of tailored approaches based on clinical severity.}

abstract = {Introduction
India accounts for 26 % of global tuberculosis (TB) cases, with delayed diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and drug resistance exacerbating disease transmission. Conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains time-consuming, while molecular tools like the Xpert MTB/RIF assay—though rapid—are limited to detecting MTB and rifampicin (RIF) resistance. Testing for isoniazid (INH) and second-line drugs requires the costly Xpert MTB/XDR assay. Although line probe assays (LPAs) identifies first- and second-line drug resistance, their accessibility is restricted to specialized laboratories. This underscores the need for a rapid, cost-effective alternative to diagnose resistance to INH and fluoroquinolones (FQs).
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed at the Department of Microbiology, AIIMS Bhubaneswar, and the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL), Cuttack, from March 2022 to April 2023. MTB isolates (n = 123) were analyzed using LPAs (Hain Lifescience's Genotype MTBDRplus and Genotype MTBDRsl) and multiplex allele-specific (MAS) PCR. The MAS-PCR targeted mutations in katG codon 315 and the inhA-15 promoter region for INH resistance, and gyrA codon 94 for FQ resistance.
Results
MAS-PCR identified INH resistance in 28/123 (22.76 %) isolates. Compared to LPA, MAS-PCR demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of 80.77 %, 93.81 %, 77.78 %, 94.79 %, and 91.06 %, respectively, for INH resistance. For FQ resistance, MAS-PCR identified 19/123 (15.44 %) resistant isolates, with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 87.50 %, 95.33 %, 73.68 %, 98.08 %, and 94.31 %, respectively, relative to LPA.
Conclusion
MAS-PCR offers a rapid, technically feasible, and cost-effective method for detecting resistance to INH and FQs. Its high accuracy and affordability position it as a viable alternative in resource-limited settings, facilitating timely TB diagnosis and resistance management.}

abstract = {Renal Resistive Index (RRI) and Renal Pulsatility Index (RPI) are currently used in the diagnosis of ureteral obstruction, early diagnosis and follow-up of acute kidney injury, assessment of chronic kidney disease, and evaluation of transplanted kidneys. However, their inter-observer and inter-scanner variability has not been investigated in dogs, limiting the accuracy and clinical applicability of these indices. The objectives of this cross-sectional observational prospective study were to assess the inter-observer and inter-scanner variability of RRI and RPI and to determine whether operator experience influences measurement accuracy. RRI and RPI were measured in the left kidney of 10 client-owned dogs by four different operators with varying levels of experience, using two different ultrasound scanners. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two ultrasound scanners for both RRI and RPI were good to excellent in all four observers (ICC > 0.75 and p < 0.05). Similarly, a good to excellent correlation coefficient was observed between the measurements of the four operators for both indices across each ultrasound scanner (ICC > 0.75 and p < 0.05). These findings indicate that RRI and RPI are feasible and reproducible measurements with good inter-scanner and inter-observer agreement, regardless of operator experience. However, achieving high reproducibility requires adequate training and the use of a standardized protocol with strict but adaptable settings tailored to each patient's characteristics.}

abstract = {Background: Neuromyths are widespread among educators, which raises concerns about misconceptions regarding the (neural) principles underlying learning in the educator population. With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, educators are increasingly relying on these for lesson planning and professional development. Therefore, if LLMs correctly identify neuromyths, they may help to dispute related misconceptions. Method: We evaluated whether LLMs can correctly identify neuromyths and whether they may hint educators to neuromyths in applied contexts when users ask questions comprising related misconceptions. Additionally, we examined whether explicitly prompting LLMs to base their answer on scientific evidence or to correct unsupported assumptions would decrease errors in identifying neuromyths. Results: LLMs outperformed humans in identifying neuromyth statements as used in previous studies. However, when presented with applied user-like questions comprising misconceptions, they struggled to highlight or dispute these. Interestingly, explicitly asking LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions increased the likelihood that misconceptions were flagged considerably, while prompting the models to rely on scientific evidence had only little effects. Conclusion: While LLMs outperformed humans at identifying isolated neuromyth statements, they struggled to hint users towards the same misconception when they were included in more applied user-like questions—presumably due to LLMs’ tendency toward sycophantic responses. This limitation suggests that, despite their potential, LLMs are not yet a reliable safeguard against the spread of neuromyths in educational settings. However, when users explicitly prompt LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions—an approach that may initially seem counterintuitive–this effectively reduced sycophantic responses.}

This study investigates the attitudes of English major students toward peer feedback in academic writing classes, using Sociocultural Theory as the analytical framework. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, the study first surveyed 142 students to quantify general trends in attitudes, followed by semi-structured interviews with 12 participants to explore the sociocultural dimensions underpinning those attitudes. Findings indicate that while students generally perceive peer feedback as beneficial for their academic development, their engagement is notably shaped by sociocultural factors including face-saving norms, perceived proficiency hierarchies, and interpersonal relationship dynamics. Significantly, students strongly preferred anonymity in peer feedback to mitigate emotional discomfort and enhance objectivity. The study concludes that incorporating anonymous feedback mechanisms in peer review activities substantially addresses sociocultural constraints and improves student engagement, thus representing a key strategy for effective writing instruction in EFL contexts. These insights underscore the importance of culturally responsive pedagogical practices and provide clear implications for instructional design in writing pedagogy.}

At the primary analysis of the EV-302 trial, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab (EV+P) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC).
Patients and methods
We present an updated analysis of efficacy and safety in the overall population, with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, providing an additional year of follow-up since the primary analysis.
Results
The median PFS by blinded independent central review was 12.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-16.6 months] for the EV+P arm and 6.3 months (95% CI 6.2-6.5 months) for the chemotherapy arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.57]. The median OS was 33.8 months (95% CI 26.1-39.3 months) for the EV+P arm and 15.9 months (95% CI 13.6-18.3 months) for the chemotherapy arm (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.61). Safety data with an additional year of follow-up were consistent with those of the primary analysis.
Conclusion
The continued survival benefit with EV+P compared with chemotherapy in this updated analysis reinforces EV+P as the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with la/mUC.}

abstract = {Purpose
To measure the accuracy and cost of a proof-of-concept prompted large language model (LLM) to route procedure requests to the appropriate phone number or pager at a single large academic hospital.
Materials and Methods
At a large academic hospital, existing teams, pager/phone numbers, and schedules were used to create text-based rules for procedure requests. A prompted LLM was created to route procedure requests at specific days and times to the appropriate teams. The prompted LLM was tested on 250 “in-scope” requests (explicitly defined by provided rules) and 25 “out-of-scope” requests using generative pretrained transformer (GPT)–3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models from OpenAI and 4 open-weight models.
Results
The prompted LLM correctly routed 96.4% of in-scope and 76.0% of out-of-scope requests using GPT-4, which outperformed all other models (P < .001). All models demonstrated worse performance for requests during evening and weekend hours (P < .001). OpenAI application programming interface costs were approximately $0.03 per request for GPT-4 and $0.0006 per request for GPT-3.5-turbo.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the accuracy of low-cost prompted LLMs to appropriately route procedure requests in a large academic hospital system. A similar approach may be used to help clinicians navigate a radiology phone tree or as a tool to help reading room coordinators route requests effectively.}

Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming musculoskeletal research, offering new approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and patient management in osteoarthritis (OA). However, implementation and ethical challenges persist. This manuscript summarizes insights from the OARSI 2025 Pre-Congress Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in Osteoarthritis Research, highlighting opportunities and challenges in applying AI across biomechanics, imaging, and clinical research domains.
Design
The workshop, organized by the OARSI Early Career Investigator Committee and co-chaired by Drs. Matthew Harkey and Brooke Patterson, convened experts to discuss the use of AI in real-world biomechanics data collection, radiomics for imaging-based biomarkers, and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and research applications. Emphasis was placed on the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical oversight.
Results
In biomechanics, AI-driven markerless motion capture and wearable sensors enable scalable, ecologically valid data collection, though issues such as class imbalance, data privacy, and model interpretability remain. In imaging, radiomics and deep learning models show promise for early OA detection and progression prediction but face challenges in domain adaptation and external validation. In clinical research, LLMs can streamline documentation and thematic analysis but must address concerns around bias, data security, and transparency. Across domains, transparency, reproducibility, and ethical use of AI were emphasized as critical for maintaining scientific rigor.
Conclusions
Cross-disciplinary collaboration and AI literacy are essential to responsibly advance AI integration in OA research. The workshop’s collective insights call for ethical, patient-centered approaches that leverage AI’s strengths while preserving research integrity and trust.}

abstract = {Background
Cognitive assessment is an important component of applied psychology, but limited access and high costs make these evaluations challenging.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) to create personalized artificial intelligence–based verbal comprehension tests (AI-BVCTs) for assessing verbal intelligence, in contrast with traditional assessment methods based on standardized norms.
Methods
We used a within-participants design, comparing scores obtained from AI-BVCTs with those from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) verbal comprehension index (VCI). In total, 8 Hebrew-speaking participants completed both the VCI and AI-BVCT, the latter being generated using the LLM Claude.
Results
The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) demonstrated strong agreement between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (Claude: CCC=.75, 90% CI 0.266-0.933; GPT-4: CCC=.73, 90% CI 0.170-0.935). Pearson correlations further supported these findings, showing strong associations between VCI and AI-BVCT scores (Claude: r=.84, P<.001; GPT-4: r=.77, P=.02). No statistically significant differences were found between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (P>.05).
Conclusions
These findings support the potential of LLMs to assess verbal intelligence. The study attests to the promise of AI-based cognitive tests in increasing the accessibility and affordability of assessment processes, enabling personalized testing. The research also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy and overreliance on AI in clinical work. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to establish the validity and reliability of this approach and develop more accurate scoring procedures.}

abstract = {Conventional methods for restoring unknown regions in images often face challenges arising from ambiguous semantics and unrealistic structural reconstructions. These issues primarily stem from the rigid frameworks that struggle to extract reliable semantic information from corrupted inputs. To overcome these limitations and improve model adaptability, we propose a flexible model that leverages dynamic feature aggregation and mask-aware guidance. Our approach introduces an integrated architecture that synergizes Transformers and CNNs, endowed with dynamic learning mechanisms through image and feature-level predictive filtering. This innovative architecture is further enhanced by a mask-guided, dual-way dynamic convolution designed to address discordant decoding issues. The effectiveness of these novel components is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on various benchmark datasets, consistently achieving superior performance in reconstructing coherent and plausible structures, particularly in cases of severe corruption.}

This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of >4 orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of ≃50. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.}

Examples of approaches to classifying research have been applied to surgical simulation educational research. The article outlines these classifications and offers simulation examples. The surgical simulation community have published research priorities with most articles reflecting strong positivist notions of research. We believe this is a limited view and argue for research that seeks to deepen understanding of how simulation supports learning and can prepare trainees for the complexity of surgical practice. We acknowledge the role of professional communities in advancing simulation research and look to a future of interdisciplinary research.

This configurative review explores how the concept of creative learning has been understood and put into practice across 112 education studies since 2010. Specifically, the review addresses two questions: First, what are the constitutive features and actions that characterize creative learning? Second, what are the overarching themes that can be identified in the literature? The study reports on the findings of an extensive thematic analysis, which indicated four general approaches to creative learning: namely (1) creative agency over learning, (2) affective and embodied pathways, (3) relational ecologies, and (4) learning by doing and making. The review concludes with a discussion of each of these themes, deriving from them a set of practical recommendations and a revised definition of creative learning.}

To assess the clinical reasoning capabilities of two large language models, ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0, compared to those of neonatal nurses during neonatal care scenarios.
Design
A cross-sectional study with a comparative evaluation using a survey instrument that included six neonatal intensive care unit clinical scenarios.
Participants
32 neonatal intensive care nurses with 5–10 years of experience working in the neonatal intensive care units of three medical centers.
Methods
Participants responded to 6 written clinical scenarios. Simultaneously, we asked ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 to provide initial assessments and treatment recommendations for the same scenarios. The responses from ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 were then scored by certified neonatal nurse practitioners for accuracy, completeness, and response time.
Results
Both models demonstrated capabilities in clinical reasoning for neonatal care, with Claude-2.0 significantly outperforming ChatGPT-4 in clinical accuracy and speed. However, limitations were identified across the cases in diagnostic precision, treatment specificity, and response lag.
Conclusions
While showing promise, current limitations reinforce the need for deep refinement before ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 can be considered for integration into clinical practice. Additional validation of these tools is important to safely leverage this Artificial Intelligence technology for enhancing clinical decision-making.
Impact
The study provides an understanding of the reasoning accuracy of new Artificial Intelligence models in neonatal clinical care. The current accuracy gaps of ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 need to be addressed prior to clinical usage.}

abstract = {Despite the growing body of research exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts, there remains a critical gap in understanding the specific effects of generative AI (GAI) on English language learning, particularly within higher education in Thailand. This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking.}

abstract = {Introduction
Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a rare condition in athletes and musicians who perform repeated prolonged forced gripping movements. It mainly affects young men, and presents with cramp-like pain, beginning on the anteromedial side of the forearm and progressively extending to the entire circumference, and may be associated with muscle weakness and neurologic symptoms. The objective of this study was to report preliminary results of ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome.
Material and methods
A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted. Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome was diagnosed on clinical presentation and pathological intramuscular pressure measurement, defined as >30 mmHg at 1 min after effort. The series comprised 7 men, with bilateral involvement. Mean age was 30 years. All patients were motorcyclists. The mean preoperative intramuscular pressure at 1 min after effort was 60.75 mmHg (range: 30−81 mmHg). The main study endpoint was change in pain on visual analogic scale. Secondary endpoints comprised patient satisfaction, change in competitive sports level, and time to return to sport. Complications were noted.
Results
Six patients (12 forearms) were evaluated. Mean follow-up was 22.5 months (range: 3–48 months). Mean pain rating was 7.3/10 (range: 6–9) preoperatively, and 0/10 postoperatively. All patients were satisfied with the procedure. Mean time to return to sports was 25.5 days (range: 21–30 days). No patients decreased their competitive sports level after the procedure. One patient presented a postoperative hematoma, not requiring surgery.
Conclusion
Ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is an innovative technique with promising preliminary results.

The National Library of Medicine’s Integrated Academic/Advanced Information Management Systems (IAIMS) initiative played a central role in the evolution of health informatics over the project’s lifetime (1983–2009) and continues to do so.
Aim
Our objective is to demonstrate how IAIMS and two key IAIMS concepts, integration and outreach, have functioned at very different times during this evolutionary process.
Approach
Using a framework drawn from Lorenzi and Stead’s 2021 history of IAIMS, we examine the role of integration and outreach in work at the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) in the early 1980s and at the University of Texas Arlington (UTA) in 2020.
Results
Guided by these concepts, UMB implemented a campus-wide information utility, while UTA established a center to accelerate research and innovation.
Conclusions
Outreach and integration have been formative in the evolution of health informatics and will continue to hold their power.}

abstract = {The Infinite Monkeys Theorem has long-established the eventual certainty of the complete works of William Shakespeare being reproduced by a monkey randomly pressing keys on a typewriter. This only considers the infinite limit, with either an infinite number of monkeys and/or an infinite time period of monkey labour. Here, we consider the Finite Monkeys Theorem and look at the probability of a given string being typed by one of a finite number of monkeys within a finite time allocation consistent with estimates for the lifespan of our universe. We also calculate the expected number of keystrokes until a target string would first be produced. Given the expected time until the heat death of the universe, we demonstrate that the widely-accepted conclusion from the Infinite Monkeys Theorem is, in fact, misleading in our finite universe. As such, this places the theorem in a class of probabilistic problems or paradoxes, including the St. Petersburg paradox, Zeno's dichotomy paradox and the Ross–Littlewood paradox wherein the infinite-resource conclusions directly contradict those obtained when considering limited resources, however sizeable.}

abstract = {Involving children in creation of school meals is important to engage them on healthy and sustainable eating habits, and the whole food utilization is a way to avoid food waste and increase the consumption of nutrients. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown to be an interesting source of new ideas but has not been used for designing children’s meals. The aims of the work were to evaluate the potential of school meals either co-designed by children or generated with AI, and to explore parents’ perception towards the utilization of whole food in their children’s meal. Children, with the potential support of their parents, proposed recipes with whole fruit/vegetable utilization, and a selection among the suggestions was conducted by nutritionists and the school cooks. The selected meal was compared to a similar recipe from ChatGPT generated from a simple prompt with regard to their acceptance and emotions evoked. The two dishes were variations of carrot pie recipes including vegetable peel and were both prepared by experienced school cooks. A third recipe proposed by the school’s cooks was used as comparison. Parents’ perceptions towards whole food utilization to their children were elicited by sentence completion methodology. Results showed that children liked both their and the cooks’ recipes but rejected ChatGPT’s recipe. Both cooks’ and children’s carrot pies evoked positive emoji pairs, meanwhile ChatGPT’s carrot pie was associated to emojis of negative connotation. Texture and unfamiliar taste were cited to justify the rejection. For parents, the utilization of whole fruits/vegetable in children’s meals is perceived as a good and nutritious idea, but safety concerns were revealed. This work demonstrates co-design with school children and whole food utilization as actionable strategies towards reducing waste of nutritious resources. Moreover, the study reports an unsuccessful exploratory usage of ChatGPT through a task-focused prompt. This may suggest the importance of specifying the context of the task when prompting an AI, to compensate for contextual information that is implicitly available to humans. Concerns about safety aspects should be addressed to ensure parents’ support for whole vegetable utilization in school meals.}

Background
Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has expanded across various fields, including medical education and professional applications. However, the extent to which AI is utilized in writing personal statements (PSs) for adult reconstruction fellowship applications remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of AI-generated text in PSs submitted to our institution before and after the release of ChatGPT.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed PSs submitted to our institution’s adult reconstruction fellowship from 2021 to 2025. The PSs were divided into two cohorts: Pre-PS (2021 to 2022) and Post-PS (2024 to 2025). The PSs from 2023 were excluded due to uncertainty in AI adoption. All PSs were analyzed using GPTZero, an AI detection software, to determine the proportion of AI-generated versus human-generated text. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses were conducted.
Results
A total of 421 PSs were analyzed. The Pre-PS cohort had an average GPTZero score of 99.5% (SD 1.9) human, 0.4% (SD 0.8) AI, and 0.1% (SD 1.8) mixed, while the Post-PS cohort had scores of 83.8% (SD 29.9) human, 15.1% (SD 28.9) AI, and 1.1% mixed (SD 5.2) (P < 0.001). The AI-generated text was significantly more prevalent in the Post-PS cohort compared to the Pre-PS cohort. Additionally, international medical graduates (IMGs) and applicants from non-U.S. residencies demonstrated a higher proportion of AI-generated text in their PSs compared to U.S. applicants (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The use of AI in PS writing has increased significantly since the release of ChatGPT. Given the role of PSs in candidate selection, these findings highlight the need for transparency, standardized guidelines regarding AI-assisted writing, and re-evaluation of the importance placed on personal statements in candidate selection. Further research should expand to other subspecialties and institutions to assess the broader implications of AI in postgraduate medical education.}

Implemented in a postgraduate Business Economics course at a business school in Singapore, the intervention embedded ChatGPT across four Executive MBA cohorts (n = 87) using scenario-based prompting, Socratic inquiry, and transcript-annotated reflection. Comparative analysis with four demographically matched traditional cohorts (n = 93) revealed that GenAI-supported instruction significantly improved assignment performance. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression confirmed that AI integration was a robust and statistically significant predictor of higher scores, even after controlling for demographic and professional background variables. Simultaneous quantile regression further showed that lower-performing students experienced the greatest gains, highlighting the intervention's equalizing potential. Beyond these quantitative results, students demonstrated more structured economic reasoning and deeper conceptual application. By emphasizing faculty agency, ethical AI use, and inquiry-based design, this model offers a scalable and replicable approach for integrating GenAI in executive education.}

As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth—namely that highly hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and cell envelope morphology (hops are not equally effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre- and post-assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.}

abstract = {Considering the influence of external time-varying disturbances on trajectory tracking control of nonlinear systems, a novel prescribed-time nonsingular sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed. Firstly, based on the definition of prescribed time stability, a lemma of practical prescribed time stability is proposed, which guarantees the system states converge to a region within the prescribed time. Secondly, a prescribed time SMC method is designed, which does not contain negative power terms in the controller and solves the singular problem. In addition, a continuous function is adopted instead of the sign function to reduce chattering, and it is also considered in the stability proof. The stability analysis shows that whatever it is in the sliding stage or the reaching stage, the tracking error is prescribed time stable. On the basis of prescribed time SMC method, the neural network (NN) is introduced to approximate the unknown model information. Finally, compared with other existing control methods, the results of simulation demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance, encompassing the achievement of prescribed time stability, the elimination of chattering, and the capability to analyze unknown model information via neural networks.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to assess whether information from AI chatbots on benefits and harms of breast and prostate cancer screening were concordant with evidence-based cancer screening recommendations.
Methods
Seven unique prompts (four breast cancer; three prostate cancer) were presented to ChatGPT in March 2024. A total of 60 criteria (30 breast; 30 prostate) were used to assess the concordance of information. Concordance was scored between 0 and 2 against the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast and prostate cancer screening recommendations independently by international cancer screening experts.
Results
43 of 60 (71.7 %) criteria were completely concordant, 3 (5 %) were moderately concordant and 14 (23.3 %) were not concordant or not present, with most of the non-concordant criteria (9 of 14, 64.3 %) being from prompts for the oldest age groups. ChatGPT hallucinations (i.e., completely made up, non-sensical or irrelevant information) were found in 9 of 60 criteria (15 %).
Conclusions
ChatGPT provided information mostly concordant with USPSTF breast and prostate cancer screening recommendations, however, important gaps exist. These findings provide insights into the role of AI to communicate cancer screening benefits and harms and hold increased relevance for periods of guideline change.
Practice implications
AI generated information on cancer screening should be taken in conjunction with official screening recommendations and/or information from clinicians.}
