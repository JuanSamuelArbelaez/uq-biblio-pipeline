abstract = {Blockchain technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, prompting researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses to seek viable ways to validate the application of blockchain within their specific use cases. Blockchain decision schemes (BDSs) can assist in this decision-making process, offering a potentially more cost-effective alternative to domain experts. Flow chart blockchain decision schemes (FC-BDSs) constitute 77.5% of all BDSs, and this paper systematically reviews these by standardising and aggregating the most prominent schemes into an open-source package. Central to our approach is the definition of an FC-BDS as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Upon this mathematical foundation, we engage in a meticulous exploration and analysis of various elements within FC-BDSs. We present an in-depth analysis of the structure of FC-BDSs, exploring features such as vertex count, question categorisation, and outcome distribution. Notably, the majority of FC-BDS questions ask about data and participation (34.1%) above other domains such as security (18.6%) and performance (10.8%). Observations regarding outcomes shows an overall balance in suggesting the usage or avoidance of blockchains; however, there is a discrepancy between the average questions required to reach these outcomes, revealing potential biases within schemes. Further analysis using similarity metrics (based on both structural and semantic features) identifies significant overlaps between FC-BDSs, with some schemes showing over 90% similarity. These observations could be attributed to a more informal publishing routine for FC-BDSs, and help trace the evolution of FC-BDSs over time. The insights drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the broader BDSs landscape, and stand to make significant strides towards the standardisation of FC-BDSs, thereby promoting a more coherent and effective utilisation of these decision-making tools in the realm of blockchain technology application.}

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the most recent LLMs—Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash—in yielding correct answers to questions related to soil science, a fundamental discipline in agricultural, natural resources, and environmental sciences. For this purpose, 105 specialized multiple-choice questions covering all domains of soil science were selected from the Iranian national PhD entrance exam in soil science. The GPT-4o-based chatbot, also known as ChatGPT, was employed to translate questions from Persian into English to assess the impact of input language on its performance. The LLMs were compared using Cohen's Kappa coefficient and the Chi-Square test. The study results indicated that the overall performance of chatbots powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o was comparable, as both models correctly answered 64.80 % of the questions. Nevertheless, these chatbots had significantly higher answering accuracy than Gemini 1.5 Pro and cost-efficient LLMs, namely Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini (p < 0.05). This finding suggests that soil science questions could be categorized as complex tasks for chatbots. The GPT-4o model's performance in answering questions was not significantly dependent on the language used (p > 0.05), revealing that input language is not a limiting factor when applying ChatGPT to soil science. Overall, AI chatbots can, at best, achieve slightly above-moderate performance in answering soil science questions. The study highlights the importance of soil scientists' knowledge and experience in integrating AI chatbots into soil science research and education.}

It is important to design and optimize the geometry of architected materials within a wide search space. This study integrates Voronoi tessellation and informatics to construct architected materials informatics for geometry optimization. Voronoi tessellation can design diverse architected materials by dividing a design space with bisecting planes between arbitrarily arranged seed points and replacing the bisecting plane edges with solid struts. The neural network surrogate model predicts the properties of the architected materials based on the seed point coordinates and the strut radius. The genetic algorithm inversely analyzes the surrogate model to optimize the seed point coordinates and strut radius directly linked to the optimized architected material geometry. This framework rapidly optimized the geometry of cellular-structured heat sinks, optimally balancing pressure loss and heat transfer (Pareto front) under forced convection. The optimized geometry of the Pareto front was validated using computational fluid dynamics and experiments. In addition, the data obtained during the optimization was analyzed to develop a strategy to improve the pressure loss and heat transfer trade-off. This study provides architected materials informatics framework to optimize the geometry of architected materials for diverse applications.}

In domains such as urban dynamics, environmental monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems, predictive models must effectively integrate heterogeneous data sources while maintaining transparency in decision making. This paper introduces a novel Two-Stage Attention Integrated Graph-Based Multi-source Spatio-Temporal Data Fusion Network (2S-AGMSTDF) that leverages generative AI-enhanced representations to improve both prediction accuracy and model interpretability. In the first stage, we perform external feature embedding using an Augmented Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network (AKGCN), spatial feature embedding via a GCN-ResNet-based Cross-Modality Transformer (GRCMT), and temporal feature embedding using an Attention-Based LSTM. The second stage fuses the learned embeddings through a Sparse Attentive Backtracking LSTM, enabling the model to trace influential patterns across modalities and time steps. This architecture allows for effective fusion of diverse data types, such as environmental indicators, mobility patterns, and auxiliary data such as traffic flow and point-of-interest (POI) information. The proposed method demonstrates how generative AI techniques can improve both the quality of the representation and the fusion process across modalities, enabling scalable and interpretable predictions in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets validate the superiority of 2S-AGMSTDF in terms of predictive performance and model transparency, making it a strong candidate for GenAI-based information fusion applications.}

The study conducted path analyses on 16,148 secondary school students in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, China in PISA 2022. The results showed that growth mindsets, ICT self-efficacy, and creative environments can directly promote their creative self-efficacy and thinking, while school environments negatively impact creative thinking. Besides, online information practices mediate the relationship between predictors, CSE, and creative thinking. However, ICT feedback and support do not serve as mediators for creative thinking. ICT availability at school positively affects CSE through ICT feedback, while ICT availability outside of school has a negative effect. This study highlights the combined influence of individual traits, behaviors, and external environments on students’ creative thinking, providing valuable insights for educators to take a holistic approach to fostering student development.}

abstract = {Background
Pyloromyotomy is a clean surgical procedure with a low risk of surgical site infections (SSIs). Despite this, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is often administered, raising concerns about unnecessary antibiotic exposure and antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to evaluate whether SAP reduces SSI rates in infants undergoing pyloromyotomy for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and to propose a guideline for selective SAP omission.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Infants undergoing pyloromyotomy between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023 were included. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SSIs within 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included stratified rates of superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space SSIs.
Results
Among 4917 infants (age <1 year; 84.26 % male), 49.48 % received SAP. Additionally, 81 patients (1.65 %) received post-operative antibiotics beyond the intraoperative period. The overall SSI rate was 1.42 %, primarily comprised of superficial SSIs. There was no significant difference in SSI rates between infants receiving SAP (1.15 %) and those not receiving SAP (1.69 %) (p = 0.110). The rate of unplanned readmission and unplanned return to the operating room within 30 days was 2.44 % and 1.04 %, respectively, with no significant difference between those who received post-operative antibiotics and those who did not (p > 0.2 for both comparisons).
Conclusions
Routine SAP administration in pyloromyotomy is unnecessary given the low risk of SSIs. SAP in ASA Class I or II infants undergoing isolated pyloromyotomy without mucosal perforation, immune-compromising conditions, infections, or trauma should be omitted. These findings support efforts to optimize antibiotic stewardship in pediatric surgical practice.

In this study, a green, efficient, and cost-effective tactic was creatively proposed so that the aerated liquid fraction of digestate (aerated-LFD) could be employed to pretreat corn straw. The influence of aerated-LFD post different aeration intervals (10min, 60min, 120min) and aerated-LFD without aeration on the biomethane production of corn straw were compared. The results show that the lignocellulosic array structure was disrupted, promoting microbial attachment and releasing soluble organic matter crucial for methane production. Methane production performance was better in all aerated-LFD groups than in the liquid fraction of digestate (LFD) and control group. The methane production of corn straw pretreated by 120min aerated-LFD was the highest, which was 198.23mL/gVS, 40.05% higher than the untreated corn straw, together with a 67% lag time reduction. The coupling model could well explain the kinetic behavior during anaerobic digestion of corn straw. These findings highlight the potential of aerated-LFD pretreatment as a sustainable bioenergy production strategy, offering insights into meeting energy needs while mitigating environmental impacts.}

Expressing these novel, structurally unprecedented proteins within cellular systems inherently adds complexity to their functional unpredictability. Robust biosafety and bioethics evaluations are therefore required to address potential risks such as immune reactions, cellular pathway disruptions, and environmental persistence. We systematically analyse the computational frameworks underpinning this revolution and highlight the capability of de novo proteins to act as a modular toolkit for synthetic biology. Looking forward, we envision integrating closed-loop validation with multi-omics profiling for comprehensive risk assessments along with a hierarchical design framework for advancing the future of synthetic biology – from the creation of tailored de novo functional protein modules and structure-guided rational genetic circuits design to the development of full-synthetic cellular systems, thereby establishing a scalable path from protein design to system-level implementation.}

We retrospectively investigated clinical, radiological, and pathological features of B3 lesions associated with the risk of subsequent upgrade to malignancy. Methods: We included consecutive vacuum-assisted biopsies (VABs) performed during 2011–2020 on suspicious microcalcifications not associated with other radiological signs diagnosed as B3 lesions and followed by surgical excision (SE) with definitive histological examination. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to identify independent predictors of malignancy. Results: Out of the 366 B3 lesions included, 56 (15.3 %, 95 % CI 11.8–19.4 %) had upgraded to malignancy at SE: of these, 42/366 (11.5 %, 95 % CI 8.4–15.2 %) and 14/366 (3.8 %, 95 % CI 2.1–6.3 %) were in situ and invasive carcinoma, respectively. At univariate analysis, variables positively associated with upgrade to malignancy were age ≥ 60 years (p = 0.008), mixed morphology (p = 0.018), scattered distribution (p = 0,001), extension of microcalcifications > 10 mm (p = 0.001), and mixed B3 lesion (p = 0.017). Among B3 subtypes, the highest rates of upgrade were observed for AIDEP, LCIS/LIN2, FEA + AIDEP, FEA + LCIS/LIN2, and FEA + AIDEP + LCIS/LIN2 (24.6 %, 21.4 %, 25.3 %, 20.0 % and 40.0 % respectively), while FEA and ALH/LIN1 had a lower rates of upgrade (7.5 % and 3.7 %, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed as risk factors older age (p = 0.029), larger extension (p = 0.001) and mixed morphology (p = 0.007) of microcalcifications, AIDEP (p = 0.011) among pure B3 lesions, and FEA + AIDEP (p = 0.001) and FEA + AIDEP + LCIS/LIN2 (p = 0.037) among mixed B3 lesions. Conclusions: Based on our findings, vacuum-assisted excision is reasonable as definitive management for FEA and ALH/LIN1, while SE should remain the mainstay of treatment for AIDEP and LCIS/LIN2, whose upgrade rates are too high to safely recommend VAE.}

However, with the explosive growth of demand for data and annotation in generative models and the emphasis on data-centric algorithms, improving model performance by improving data-efficiency has become another way for the future development of generative models. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to improve the performance of the generative models inspired by active learning. Through the cognitive feature extractor of generative models (similar oracle in active learning) to complete the annotation of data informativeness. By guiding the generative models to focus on samples in low-feature density region, i.e., with high informativeness, the models can gradually achieve “full-cognition” of the data. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our strategy and demonstrate its widespread application in generative models and downstream data-driven tasks.}

Credit is commonly being taken for authorship by those who fail to meet authorial criteria, which is unethical. Experienced coauthors are providing inadequate diligence in drafting, critical review, and final approval of submitted articles, which is unethical or, at the very least, careless. Research lacking originality (“copycat” studies) is becoming common, which although not unethical, is uninteresting and creates a burden for journal reviewers, editors, and, most of all, readers. Publication of least publishable units (LPU or “salami slicing”), where authors divide a single research publication into a number of papers with small amounts of information in each paper, results in quantity rather than quality and is ethically inappropriate. LPU can result in redundancy, self-plagiarism, publication overlap, and duplicate reporting of patient data that can result in inaccurate conclusions in systematic reviews. Duplicate submission of a paper to more than one journal (in the same or different languages), such that the paper is under peer review by multiple journals at the same time is unethical and can result in two or more journals publishing the same article. Duplicate publication (publication of a paper that overlaps substantially with one already published), without clear reference to the previous publication is unethical. Predatory journals, with low standards of quality or peer review, and predatory practices by publishers and owners of ostensibly nonpredatory journals, can result in solicitation and acceptance of articles (as well as author publication charges or fees) for the purpose of generating revenue, rather than for legitimate editorial reasons based on article quality and content. This is unethical. Opportunities exist to mitigate against these trends, and by naming these trends and identifying opportunities to avoid ethical transgression, our well-intentioned community can publish our scholarship in an unimpeachable manner.}

The accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has raised critical questions about the role of pharmacists and the potential for AI to substitute for human expertise in pharmaceutical care. Grounded in Porter’s Five Forces framework—specifically the threat of substitutes—this commentary explores whether AI can adequately fulfill the complex and relational functions of pharmacists in delivering care to patients. Drawing from foundational definitions of pharmaceutical care and economic theories of substitution, the paper examines both historical and emerging competitors to pharmacist-provided services, including physicians, nurses, and now AI-powered tools. Rather than assert a binary conclusion about AI’s ability to replace pharmacists, this paper identifies conditions under which substitution may be more or less likely. Key factors include the nature of the pharmaceutical care service, patient preferences, the quality and accessibility of AI tools, and regulatory and institutional constraints. Drawing on examples from practice and education, the commentary highlights areas where AI may function as a substitute—such as information delivery or curricular mapping—and others where human oversight remains central. Ultimately, the question is not whether AI will serve as a substitute, but to what extent, under what circumstances, and with what implications for pharmacy educators. Preparing students for a professional environment augmented by AI requires a shift in educational strategies, with a focus on adaptability, data literacy, and meaningful integration of emerging technologies.}

However, much of the current literature on psychopathy impairment appears mixed in findings, varying by the traits examined and measured outcomes. The current paper aims to contribute to this field of research by examining how a triarchic model of psychopathy relates to a wide variety of potential consequences, including impairment, personality functioning, interpersonal functioning, internalizing, and perceived quality of life. Through two studies utilizing the Triarchic psychopathy model in undergraduate samples, significant psychopathy impairment was identified. Broadly, disinhibition was related to the most significant impairments across functioning domains. Boldness was more variable and elicited both positive (e.g., higher quality of life, lower self-harm) and negative (impairments in empathy and intimacy) outcomes. Meanness was primarily related to interpersonal difficulties; however, differences in measuring meanness led to different findings on its connection to personality functioning. By better understanding the consequences of psychopathy and how they vary by dimensional traits, interventions can be better tailored to alleviate both individual and societal suffering.}

abstract = {The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in ophthalmology holds great promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and enhancing patient care. However, regulatory, ethical, and technical challenges must be addressed to ensure its safe and effective implementation. Bias in AI can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, while the “black-box problem” raises concerns about transparency and trust. Ethical principles must guide AI integration, particularly regarding patient safety, accountability, and liability. Privacy risks related to data collection and security are especially critical in ophthalmology, where large imaging datasets are essential. Additionally, AI-generated inaccuracies, or “hallucinations,” pose potential risks to clinical decision-making. Cybersecurity threats targeting AI-powered healthcare systems further emphasize the need for robust protections. Despite these challenges, AI has the potential to improve access to ophthalmic care, particularly in underserved regions, as seen in AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening. However, financial and infrastructural barriers remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption. Addressing these issues requires collaboration among stakeholders, including regulators, healthcare providers, AI developers, and policymakers, to establish clear guidelines and promote trustworthy AI systems. This review explores key regulatory and ethical concerns and highlights strategies to ensure the responsible integration of AI into ophthalmology.}

Mental health is an important public health issue in China, compounded by a shortage in psychiatric services. Against this backdrop, digital technologies could offer solutions. Digital mental health interventions use technologies, such as smartphone applications, to improve mental health outcomes. Although there has been a drastic increase in mental health mobile apps available in recent years, current evidence-based digital interventions for mental health are scarce and seldom evaluated for effectiveness and implementation in China. In this Viewpoint, we review digital mental health interventions in China and propose a framework that could guide the development of culturally sensitive digital mental health innovations, with the adoption of co-creation and community engagement strategies. We also provide recommendations to address issues related to usage, interventions, and implementation to improve health equity and implementation of digital mental health interventions in the Chinese context.}

The nanopores and hills, at different etching conditions, were found to have higher surface area as well as enough space to possess highly populated SERS-active sites. For short term etching in MCEE technique, the vertical etching was found to be dominant making the nanostructures narrow, whereas for long term etching pore size increased due to accelerated top lateral etching. It was noted that smaller Ag-NCs with the size distribution of 29.04±5.69 nm were observed within eSi-NSs of shorter etching time, whereas comparatively bigger Ag-NCs with the size distribution of 51.36±11.21 nm were observed within those of longer etching time. Strong SERS-activity was observed in presence of Ag-NCs-decorated eSi-NSs using Rhodamine 6G. The SERS-enhancement was noted to be as high as 1 × 106. SERS enhancements in presence of eSi-NSs with shorted etching time was noted to be nearly double of those with longer etching time. EM near-field distributions derived from finite difference time domain simulations validated the observations as well. A plausible explanation and correlation with the experimental observations have been amended.}

Background
Anorectal malformations (ARM) are often accompanied by urological anomalies, which can contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of kidney and urinary tract anomalies, as well as bladder dysfunction, and their potential impact on the development of CKD in children with ARM.
Study design
This single-center, retrospective study included 175 children with ARM, after excluding 75 children with missing data. Clinical and radiological findings and serum creatinine levels were obtained from medical records. Anorectal malformations were classified as “high” and “low” type based on the Wingspread classification, and also further classified by fistula type and sex distribution according to the Krickenbeck International Classification. CKD was defined and staged according to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines.
Results
The median age of the patients was 9.7 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.13:1. Among the 175 patients, 97 (55 %) had intermediate or low-type ARM, and 78 (45 %) had high-type ARM. Kidney and/or urinary tract anomalies were identified in 85 patients (48.5 %), with 63 having kidney anomalies and 71 having urinary tract anomalies. The most common urinary tract anomaly was vesicoureteral reflux (n = 58). Bladder dysfunction was observed in 56 patients (32 %). CKD was diagnosed in 30 patients (17 %); six of them were in CKD stage 5, and the remaining 24 were in stages 2–4. The development of CKD was more common in both females and males with kidney anomalies (p < 0.001), urinary tract anomalies (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), bladder dysfunction (p < 0.001), urinary tract infection (p < 0.001), in addition females with persistent cloaca (p = 0.023) and spinal anomalies (p = 0.013). Kidney anomalies and bladder dysfunction were independently associated with the development of CKD (p < 0.001 and p = 0.046, respectively).
Discussion
This study highlights that approximately half of the children with ARM had kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and one-third had bladder dysfunction. Additionally, almost one-fifth of the patients developed CKD, mostly in the early stages. Our findings also suggest that both kidney anomalies and bladder dysfunction are significant risk factors for CKD development in children with ARM.
Conclusion
This study emphasizes the presence of kidney anomalies, along with bladder dysfunction as risk factors for CKD. Physicians should take care to monitor and manage these risks to minimize the long-term impacts on kidney health in children with ARM.}

abstract = {Background
Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Given its rarity, clinical management often mirrors colorectal cancer dCRC), despite distinct molecular features and inferior outcomes. Although checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy has shown efficacy in mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC, data in SBA remain scarce, and MMR testing is not routinely implemented.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of SBA patients treated with CPI at Copenhagen University Hospital – Herlev between March 2019 and January 2024. Radiological responses were assessed using RECIST v1.1. We also analyzed the frequency of MMR testing and dMMR status in SBA patients.
Results
Among 148 SBA patients, seven received CPI therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was 86%, with one (14%) complete response (CR) and five (71%) partial responses (PR). Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 31 months (mFU:32 months); median overall survival (mOS) was not reached (mFU: 33 months). Overall, 55% underwent MMR testing, and 18% of SBA patients were dMMR.
Conclusion
CPI therapy yields high, durable response rates in dMMR SBA, supporting dMMR as a predictive biomarker. However, inconsistent MMR testing strategy may limit access to optimal treatment. Routine molecular profiling and broader biomarker discovery are key to expanding CPI eligibility and improving outcomes.}

To contribute to this understanding, the objective of this work was to assess students’ perceptions of the widely diffused chatbot ChatGPT and its use as a learning tool. A mixed methodology was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses in a repeated cross-sectional study with an intervention. Data was collected from undergraduate students in Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering across three different semesters. The qualitative evaluation indicated that the course level had no impact on students’ perceptions, and gender only influenced prior knowledge of ChatGPT, without affecting satisfaction or perceived usability. The strongest correlation was found between the perceived quality of the responses and overall satisfaction. Response quality was also a central theme in the qualitative data, with about 45 % of respondents noting that ChatGPT should be used cautiously due to its lack of accuracy in more complex tasks. The study also evaluated ChatGPT's specific applicability as a learning tool in courses focused on machining. In this context, students viewed its use positively when applied as a complementary aid. Ultimately, the results suggest that, regardless of students' prior familiarity with ChatGPT, most were able to use it effectively, demonstrated critical thinking regarding its use, and expressed willingness to adopt it as a complementary learning tool.}

abstract = {Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a rare but often fatal complication of allogeneic transfusion, caused by the activation and expansion of donor T lymphocytes in susceptible recipients. Prevention focuses on reducing these immune cells through leukoreduction and irradiation. While leukoreduction of blood components decreases white blood cell content and improves overall transfusion safety, it does not fully prevent TA-GVHD, as viable T cells may persist. Irradiation using gamma or X-ray methods remain the most effective strategy, inactivating donor T cells by inducing DNA damage and suppressing proliferation. However, it also compromises red blood cell quality by increasing hemolysis, oxidative injury, membrane damage, extracellular potassium, and reducing storage duration. As an alternative, hypothermic storage of leukoreduced red blood cells is gaining attention. Evidence suggests that extending storage beyond 21 days significantly reduces T cell viability and proliferation without compromising red blood cell integrity. Further research is needed to directly compare the efficacy of hypothermic storage to irradiation.}

abstract = {Purpose
LibQUAL is an international recognized tool for evaluating user satisfaction across three dimensions: Affect of Service, Information Control and Library as Place. With the rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in library systems, spanning both the Global South and North, there is a growing need to adapt LibQUAL to reflect these technological advancements. This study aims to advocate for a revision of LibQUAL to include a dedicated AI dimension that aligns with evolving service models.
Design/methodology/approach
This conceptual study draws on a comprehensive review of recent practices that highlights the increasing integration of AI technologies across diverse library contexts. This paper investigates how AI tools such as chatbots, recommendation systems and automated cataloguing are reshaping traditional library functions and user experiences.
Findings
This study proposes that LibQUAL should evolve to include a fourth dimension focused on AI services. This future-ready addition would enable libraries to assess the quality of AI-driven offerings, gather targeted feedback from users, identify service gaps and implement iterative improvements. Despite widespread AI adoption, no existing opinion piece or framework has thoroughly addressed the need for updating LibQUAL to reflect this AI shift.
Originality/value
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is among the first to systematically argue for the integration of AI as a core evaluative category in LibQUAL. It contributes to both library assessment literature and strategic planning by offering a forward-looking approach to measuring service quality in an increasingly AI-reliant library environment.}

The purpose of our study was to develop a novel magnetic resonance imaging classification system to predict the progression of traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (TONFH) in young adults and assess its clinical implications.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2007 to December 2022, including 134 hips (134 patients, mean age 41 years (range, 21 to 43), 65.7% men) diagnosed with TONFH at Association Research Circulation Osseous Stage I. The bone repair band (BRB) classification system categorized lesions into Superficial (Type S), Uncertain (Type U), and Extensive (Type E) based on magnetic resonance imaging coronal views. Patients were followed with observational treatment and x-ray assessments. Radiographic signs and femoral head collapse were evaluated during follow-up. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between BRB classification and disease progression.
Results
The 134 hips were categorized into Type S (n = 54), Type U (n = 21), and Type E (n = 59). Over a mean follow-up of 39.6 months, radiographic signs were most prevalent in Type E (94.9%) and least in Type S (9.3%), with median times to radiographic signs of 18 months for Type U and 16 months for Type E. Femoral head collapse occurred in 50.8% of Type E, 23.8% of Type U, and none in Type S, with a median time to collapse of 34 months for Type E. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified BRB classification as an independent predictor of disease progression, with Type E showing the highest risk for adverse outcomes.
Conclusions
The newly proposed BRB classification provides a systematic approach to assessing necrotic lesion severity in TONFH and demonstrates significant correlation with femoral head collapse risk. Future studies are needed to further validate its clinical significance and explore the anatomical basis underlying this classification.}

However, cell processing facilities (CPFs) still heavily rely on manual operations by cell processing operators (CPOs). The intricate nature of cell culture and stringent sterility requirements impose a considerable psychological burden on CPOs, particularly the risk of cell contamination. This study delves into the psychological aspects experienced by CPOs in relation to the risk of contamination during cell culture. An online survey was conducted across 47 sites to investigate concerns regarding contamination and the strategies implemented to mitigate contamination risk in cell processing facilities. The survey findings revealed that 72 % of operators expressed concern about contamination, with 18 % reporting direct experiences of contamination. This indicates that the perceived contamination risk in CPFs is higher than the actual reported incidents. Furthermore, this study examines operational practices, such as material handling, and the utilization of biological safety cabinets (BSCs). The results highlight variations in BSC utilization and material handling practices, underscoring potential operational challenges. Implementing risk assessments and leveraging evidence-based data at each site could help address these challenges and alleviate the psychological strain on CPOs. This, in turn, would enhance the quality of cell therapy products and improve the well-being of CPOs.}

The contemporary management of patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases is complex. This study appraises the recommendations made by national/international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with synchronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
Methods
A systematic review of national and international guidelines published between 2011 and 2024 was carried out using PubMed, OvidSP and Guidelines International Network databases. The quality of guidelines was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. Guidelines were assessed for the quality of advice for specific scenarios. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021243744).
Results
The search strategy returned ninety unique articles with 11 guidelines eligible for inclusion. Of these, one (9 %) guideline defined ‘synchronous disease’ at outset, eight (73 %) recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy as first intervention. Seven (64 %) guidelines supported synchronous hepatic resection with colectomy. One (9 %) recommended against synchronous surgery.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates important variations between international clinical guidelines on diagnostic workup and management of synchronous liver metastases in colorectal cancer. [167 words].}

Knowledge of the traits that influence tick resistance contributes to the development of breeding strategies designed to improve herd productivity. Within this context, this study evaluated the resistance of Caracu, a tropically adapted cattle breed, to R. microplus. Tick count, hair length, coat thickness, and coat color were evaluated in 202 naturally tick-infested females (cows and heifers) over a period of 18 months. Blood samples were collected from all animals during the winter season for hematological analysis. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlations, generalized linear models, and principal component analysis. Correlation coefficients of tick count with coat color, coat thickness, and hair length were estimated within each season. Hematological parameters were only included in the winter season analysis and were analyzed by the restricted maximum likelihood method using log-transformed data. No differences in blood parameters were observed between animals with and without ticks. However, tick count was negatively correlated with erythrocytes (−0.29) and hematocrit (−0.24) and positively correlated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (0.21) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (0.25). These findings suggest that higher tick counts lead to a decrease in erythrocytes but also to an increase in the amount of hemoglobin per erythrocyte, which could reduce the damage caused by low erythrocyte levels due to tick hematophagy, delaying or preventing anemia. Although tick infestation on pasture was demonstrated by the infestation of all staff members during herd management, none of the animals exhibited high tick counts, providing evidence of resistance of Caracu animals to R. microplus. Tick infestation was influenced by age class (cows > heifers), season (spring and summer > fall and winter), coat thickness (>1.5 mm > <1.5 mm), and hair length (>6 mm > <6 mm). Three components were extracted by principal component analysis, which accounted for 69.46% of data variance. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of efficient strategies aimed at reducing economic losses due to tick infestation and could be applied in animal breeding to select for tick resistance traits, reducing chemical control strategies and consequently improving sustainable livestock production.}

abstract = {Introduction
Distal femur fractures are commonly managed with retrograde femoral nailing or locked lateral plating (LLP). As implant design has evolved, more distal and complex patterns are being treated with intramedullary implants. The aim of the present study was to compare early outcomes in distal femur fractures managed with the novel DePuy Synthes RFN-Advanced (RFNA) Retrograde Femoral Nailing System to a similar cohort treated with locked lateral plating.
Patients and methods
This is a retrospective cohort study of operative distal femur fractures that presented to our Level I trauma center over a 7-year period. We included patients with AO/OTA types 33A2–3, 33C1–2 fractures treated with either the RFNA or a lateral locked plate over two distinct time points. Injury radiographs were reviewed independently by three orthopedic traumatologists to include only cases deemed “nailable.” Primary outcomes included coronal and sagittal alignment. Secondary outcomes included nonunion, surgical site infection (SSI), and unplanned reoperation.
Results
We identified 107 patients treated with either the RFNA (n = 45) or LLP (n = 62) over the 7-year study period. No significant differences were identified in the rates of sagittal (2.2 % versus 9.7 %, P = 0.12) or coronal malalignment (2.2 % versus 0 %, P = 0.421). The nonunion rate was 8.9 % in the RFNA cohort versus 19.4 % in the LLP cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.174). We also found no difference in infection or implant failure between groups. Screw backout occurred in 8 RFNA patients (17.8 %), with 7 patients undergoing screw removal (15.6 %) either in clinic (n = 5) or the operating room (n = 2).
Discussion and conclusions
This matched cohort study demonstrated promising results comparing the RFNA to lateral plating of distal femur fractures. The nonunion rate of 9 % in the RFNA cohort adds to recent literature that supports improved union rates with intramedullary nailing of these fractures. Interlocking screw backout was the most common complication with RFNA treatment at a rate of 16 %, with the majority removed in clinic.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into medical education, with transformative potential for learning and assessment. However, their performance across diverse medical exams globally has remained underexplored.
Objective
This study aims to introduce MedExamLLM, a comprehensive platform designed to systematically evaluate the performance of LLMs on medical exams worldwide. Specifically, the platform seeks to (1) compile and curate performance data for diverse LLMs on worldwide medical exams; (2) analyze trends and disparities in LLM capabilities across geographic regions, languages, and contexts; and (3) provide a resource for researchers, educators, and developers to explore and advance the integration of artificial intelligence in medical education.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted on April 25, 2024, in the PubMed database to identify relevant publications. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed, English-language, original research articles that evaluated at least one LLM on medical exams. Exclusion criteria included review articles, non-English publications, preprints, and studies without relevant data on LLM performance. The screening process for candidate publications was independently conducted by 2 researchers to ensure accuracy and reliability. Data, including exam information, data process information, model performance, data availability, and references, were manually curated, standardized, and organized. These curated data were integrated into the MedExamLLM platform, enabling its functionality to visualize and analyze LLM performance across geographic, linguistic, and exam characteristics. The web platform was developed with a focus on accessibility, interactivity, and scalability to support continuous data updates and user engagement.
Results
A total of 193 articles were included for final analysis. MedExamLLM comprised information for 16 LLMs on 198 medical exams conducted in 28 countries across 15 languages from the year 2009 to the year 2023. The United States accounted for the highest number of medical exams and related publications, with English being the dominant language used in these exams. The Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) series models, especially GPT-4, demonstrated superior performance, achieving pass rates significantly higher than other LLMs. The analysis revealed significant variability in the capabilities of LLMs across different geographic and linguistic contexts.
Conclusions
MedExamLLM is an open-source, freely accessible, and publicly available online platform providing comprehensive performance evaluation information and evidence knowledge about LLMs on medical exams around the world. The MedExamLLM platform serves as a valuable resource for educators, researchers, and developers in the fields of clinical medicine and artificial intelligence. By synthesizing evidence on LLM capabilities, the platform provides valuable insights to support the integration of artificial intelligence into medical education. Limitations include potential biases in the data source and the exclusion of non-English literature. Future research should address these gaps and explore methods to enhance LLM performance in diverse contexts.}

Moreover, due to differences in knowledge complexity and the availability of data resources, when performing multi-discipline tasks, users devote more effort to query optimization and data evaluation but gain lower search performance. When performing intellectual-multi-discipline tasks, data searchers use System 1 and System 2 in a complementary way to support systematic and efficient evaluation.

abstract = {Purpose
Epidural analgesia (EA) is commonly employed for postoperative pain management in children undergoing abdominal tumor resection. Indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) often remain for the duration of EA administration due to concern for associated urinary retention. This study focuses on children undergoing abdominal tumor resection with appropriate EA coverage, to assess whether IUC can be removed early with minimal risk of reinsertion for urinary retention.
Methods
A retrospective review of children who underwent abdominal tumor resections with EA between 2015 and 2023 at two institutions was conducted. Data were summarized, and rates of postoperative urinary retention requiring catheter reinsertion and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) were compared between patients with early and late IUC removal groups using Fisher's exact testing. “Early” was defined as IUC removal with EA in place and “late” as IUC removal after or concurrent with EA discontinuation.
Results
A total of 228 children underwent abdominal tumor resections with EA. Of these, 104 had early, and 124 had late IUC removal. The average postoperative day (POD) of IUC removal in the early group was 1.1±0.5 days and 2.9±1.1 days in the late group. EA was at T12 level or higher in 101 patients (97.1 %) in the early group, and 68 (54.8 %) in the late group (p<0.001). EA contained opioids in 27 (26.0 %) in the early group and 54 (43.5 %) in the late group (p=0.005). There were 6 (5.8 %) children in the early group and 1 (0.8 %) in the late group requiring re-catheterization (p = 0.049). For those requiring re-catheterization, the EA level was T7-8 in 5 patients, T10-11 in 1 patient, and T4 in 1 patient (late). There was 1 (1.0 %) patient with a CAUTI in the early group, and 3 (2.4 %) patients in the late group (p = 0.63).
Conclusions
Early removal of indwelling urinary catheters in the setting of thoracic epidural analgesia is associated with a small risk of urinary retention necessitating catheter re-insertion. Balancing the need for IUCs with this possibility, patient comfort, and infectious risk should inform decision-making to best align with enhanced recovery efforts.}

Deep learning technologies have demonstrated the ability to identify dyssynergic defecation for diagnosis of common gastrointestinal motility disorders through nuanced interpretation of 3-dimensional high-definition anal manometry (3D-HDAM). We aimed to validate a deep learning algorithm capable of spatiotemporal analysis of 3D-HDAM in a multicenter setting.
Methods
We included 1214 consecutive anorectal manometry studies performed across 3 large health care systems between 2018 and 2022. Deep learning results were compared with expert interpretation according to the London consensus protocol as reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using bootstrap sampling to calculate area under the curve (AUC). We used Wilcoxon tests to analyze how well the confidence scores from the deep learning model correlated with the likelihood that experts would assign ambiguous labels in cases where determinations were uncertain. Video-based deep learning features were clustered using Gaussian Mixture Modeling to reveal novel dyssynergia subtypes.
Results
The deep hybrid learning algorithm achieved AUCs of 0.99 (± 0.001 standard deviation), 0.90 ± 0.008, and 0.79 ± 0.003 at Dartmouth Health, Henry Ford Hospital, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, respectively, performance comparable or superior to solely deep learning or traditional modeling on every cohort. The algorithm appeared capable of reporting confidence aligned with manual expert interpretation of ambiguity (W = −20.50; P < .001; −1.73; P = .08; and −3.22; P = .001). We further identified 2 novel classes of dyssynergia patterns that may represent clinically relevant phenotypes of dyssynergia.
Conclusions
3D-HDAM combined with video-based deep learning is a useful and clinically relevant technology for evaluating anorectal dyssynergia. Future use cases can be expanded to evaluate other motility disorders and their treatment.}

This prospective exploratory study included 20 adults who visited their first outpatient clinic due to hepatobiliary or pancreatic conditions. Consultations were audio-recorded, transcribed using Whisper-1 (OpenAI), and converted into structured Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) clinical notes using ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI), implemented through Python 3.11.6. The transcriptions were manually reviewed against gold-standard references, and the ASR performance was quantified using standard metrics from the Jiwer library. Descriptive statistics were computed, and the ChatGPT note quality was evaluated using a standardized checklist, before assessing for statistical significance. The median patient age was 47 years (65 % female). The average interview duration was 15.98 min. Whisper transcribed audio in a median of 59.3 s, and ChatGPT generated SOAP notes in 5.7 s. ChatGPT produced satisfactory results in 85 % of cases, with a significant performance. The ASR system demonstrated acceptable transcription quality. The integration of Whisper and ChatGPT drastically reduced the documentation time compared with manual electronic health record (EHR) entry. Despite some limitations, these results highlight the promise of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered documentation tools in outpatient practice. Further research with larger samples and direct comparisons with traditional methods is warranted to confirm these findings and address the ethical, legal, and implementation challenges associated with AI in clinical environments.}

abstract = {Objectives
Numerous prior works have demonstrated the risk of clinical deterioration with movement and transport, and the higher the patient's acuity, the higher the risk and consequence of decompensation.
Methods
We performed a descriptive study of patients with a cardiac arrest during critical care transport (CCT) October 2020 through September 2022. Inclusion criteria included all patients with arrest after the arrival of the CCT team. To analyze factors associated with arrest, we performed a case-control study. Exclusion criteria included scene transports, pediatric patients, patients who did not arrest en route, and patients not transported.
Results
Over two years, 87 patients (0.7 %) had a cardiac arrest after arrival of the CCT team. The most common indications for transport were severe trauma, respiratory arrest, and aortic emergencies, and patients were commonly ED to ED transfers. In the case-control assessment, four variables were associated with arrest: mode of transport, OR 2.66 (95 % CI 1.05–6.75), number of vasopressors [1, OR 3.46 (95 % CI 1.05–11.39), 2, OR 6.67 (95 % CI 1.97–22.55), 3, OR 16.0, (95 % CI 3.77–68.0)], and initial MAP and SBP [both OR 0.98 (95 % CI 0.97–0.99)]. Of the 32 patients who arrested in transport, only 15 (46.9 %) had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
Conclusions
In a case-control assessment, four variables were associated with arrest in CCT: mode of transport, the number of vasopressors, the initial MAP, and the initial SBP. While cardiac arrest was uncommon, the rate of ROSC was only 46.9 %. Future work should build upon this work to determine thresholds for which patients are at the highest risk for arrest in transport.}

Estimating noncompliance and understanding its motivations is important for developing strategies to reduce illegality. In Chile, the socio-ecologically important kelp fishery (Lessonia spicata; L. berteorana) is suspected of having high levels of noncompliance. We estimated the levels and types of noncompliance within the fishery directly from small-scale fishers, along with exploring motivations for noncompliance. We did so across four different harvesting regulations, two management regimes, and two geographies. Levels of noncompliance differed across all three factors. Fishers have higher compliance in areas managed with territorial user rights management regimes compared to those managed by regional management plans that establish control rules. However, the differences were more pronounced in one geography compared to another. Fishers show high levels of normative and legitimacy-based motivations with respect to complying with kelp harvesting regulations. In contrast, instrumental motivations were weaker and more heterogenous, which may be tied to noncompliance. Results support the premise that a lack of enforcement may be the main driver of noncompliance in the Chilean kelp fishery. Thus, deterrent mechanisms such as enhancing the perceived likelihood of detection, improving surveillance methods, increasing penalties, and strengthening co-management governance through combining informal and formal mechanisms may help increase compliance.}

abstract = {Background
In addition to standard older adult care services, mobile medical devices have proved to be an effective tool for controlling the health of older adults. However, little is known about the variables driving the acceptance of these gadgets and the willingness of older adults in China to use them.
Objective
This study aims to explore the factors that affect the use of mobile health (mHealth) devices by older adults in China, focusing on individual, social, and family influences.
Methods
The Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents survey database provided the data for this study. The survey was conducted in 148 Chinese cities between June 20 and August 31, 2022. The parameters linked to older persons’ desire to use mobile medical devices were determined by this study using a combination model of multiple stepwise linear regression and a classification and regression tree decision tree.
Results
In total, 4085 older adults took part in the poll. On a scale of 0 to 100, the average score for willingness to adopt mHealth devices was 63.70 (SD 25.11). The results of the multiple stepwise linear regression showed that having a postgraduate degree and higher (β=.040; P=.007), being unemployed (β=.037; P=.02), having a high social status (β=.085; P<.001), possessing high health literacy (β=.089; P<.001), demonstrating high self-efficacy (β=.043; P=.02), not living with children (β=.0340; P=.02), having a household per capita monthly income of >Y4000 (US $550) (β=.048; P=.002), experiencing high perceived social support (β=.096; P<.001), reporting a high quality of life (β=.149; P<.001), having higher levels of family communication (β=–.071; P<.001), having an identity bubble (β=.085; P<.001), not having chronic diseases (β=.049; P=.001), and experiencing mild depression (β=–.035; P=.02) were associated with older adults’ willingness to use mHealth devices. The classification and regression tree decision tree model’s findings demonstrated that the primary determinants of older adults’ desire to use mHealth devices are quality of life, identity bubble, social status, health literacy, family health, and perceived social support.
Conclusions
This study uses the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model to investigate the effects of demand variables, enabling resources, and predisposing traits on older persons’ propensity to use mHealth devices. These results offer reference data for the marketing and use of mHealth devices for older individuals in the future. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to create a balanced and harmonious integration of technology and humanistic care.}

In this hypothesis, we employ an innovative “water pipe” theory to elucidate the potential underlying causes of CRE infection recurrence. We propose a potential therapeutic approach utilizing engineered phages to combat CRE infections, demonstrating the mechanism of action of phages carrying lytic enzymes or antimicrobial peptides against biofilms and persister cells.

abstract = {Background
Underdiagnosis or undertreatment of osteoporosis consequently impacts individual morbidity and mortality, as well as on healthcare systems and communities as a whole. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard method for identifying osteoporosis, however, opportunistic CT screening is capable of precisely estimating bone mineral density (BMD) in abdominopelvic imaging with no additional cost, radiation exposure or inconvenience to patients. This study uses opportunistic CT screening to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis and anatomic distribution patterns in patients presenting with lower extremity fractures at our institution.
Hypothesis
Trauma patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) are more likely to present with peri-articular versus shaft fractures.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective review of 721 patients presenting as trauma activations to the emergency department (ED) of a Level 1 Trauma Center with lower extremity fractures. Patients were excluded if under the age of 18 or lacking a CT scan upon arrival in the ED. Hounsfield Units (HU) were measured at the L1 vertebral level on CT scans to determine bone mineral density. Values of ≤100 HU were consistent with osteoporosis, whereas 101–150 HU were consistent with osteopenia.
Results
The final cohort included 416 patients, with mean age of 49 ± 21 years. Average bone density was 203.9 ± 73.4 HU. 15.9% of patients were diagnosed as osteopenic and 9.9% as osteoporotic. 64.2% of fractures were peri-articular, 25.7% were shaft, and 10.1% were a combination. Peri-articular fractures were significantly more likely to have lower average BMD than shaft fractures (189 ± 74.7 HU vs. 230.6 ± 66.1 HU, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a significant relationship between low bone mineral density and lower extremity fracture pattern, however, likely influenced by other factors such as sex. Opportunistic CT screening for osteoporosis in trauma settings provides ample opportunity for early detection of low BMD and implementation of highly effective lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy intervention. Reduction in the overall incidence of peri-articular fracture with widespread adoption of opportunistic CT screening may lessen the morbidity, mortality, and total cost currently afflicting patients, healthcare systems, and communities.

abstract = {Introduction
Refractory prosthetic joint infections (PJI) of the hip remain a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. The Girdlestone procedure, also known as resection arthroplasty, was originally described for native hips but has since been adopted as a salvage option for complex and recurrent prosthetic infections. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in treating prosthetic hip infections in this context.
Materials and methods
Eighty-eight patients (91 hips) who underwent femoral resection arthroplasty for refractory hip prosthesis infection between March 2004 and August 2019 were retrospectively included and analyzed as part of a single-center study with a minimum follow-up of two years. The primary outcome was infection eradication. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of treatment failure and the nature of postoperative complications. Risk factors for failure were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. Bacteriological data and functional outcomes were also reported.
Results
Out of 91 hips, infection eradication was achieved in 65 cases (71%) following Girdlestone procedure. Six postoperative deaths related to infection occurred (6/88, 7%). In 20 out of 91 hips (22%), one or more revision surgeries were performed for persistent infection after implant removal. Among these, infection control was achieved in 10/20 (50%). Multivariate analysis identified corticosteroid use (HR = 6; p < 0.01), preoperative fever (HR = 4.12; p < 0.01), and polymicrobial infection (HR = 2.5; p < 0.05) as independent risk factors for failure. The mean limb shortening was 5.7 (±1.7) cm, and the average walking distance was 175 (±350) meters. The mean Merle d’Aubigné and Postel score at final follow-up was 9.3 (±2.2) out of 18.
Conclusion
Definitive removal of the hip prosthesis remains a viable therapeutic option in refractory infections, despite a substantial complication rate. It should be considered, particularly when the prosthesis is no longer functional.
