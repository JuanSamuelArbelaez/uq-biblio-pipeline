abstract = {Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) leverages the photoacoustic effect to provide high-resolution structural and functional imaging. However, achieving high-speed imaging with high spatial resolution remains challenging. To address this, undersampling and deep learning have emerged as common techniques to enhance imaging speed. Yet, existing methods rarely achieve effective recovery of functional images. In this study, we propose Mask-enhanced U-net (MeU-net) for recovering sparsely sampled PAM structural and functional images. The model utilizes dual-channel input, processing photoacoustic data from 532 nm and 558 nm wavelengths. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive vascular attention mask module that focuses on vascular information recovery and design a vessel-specific loss function to enhance restoration accuracy. We simulate data from mouse brain and ear imaging under various levels of sparsity (4 ×, 8 ×, 12 ×) and conduct extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that MeU-net significantly outperforms traditional interpolation methods and other representative models in structural information and oxygen saturation recovery.}

The degradation efficiency of methyl orange by g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst was as high as 94.5%, which is 1.56 times higher than that by g-C3N4. This was attributed to the V2C MXene inhibiting the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and facilitating rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons (e−) from g-C3N4 to MXene. Moreover, g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst showed good cycling stability. The photocatalytic performance was higher than 85% after three cycles. Experiments to capture free radicals revealed that superoxide radicals (·O2−) are the main contributors to the photocatalytic activity. Thus, the proposed g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst is a promising visible-light catalyst.}

To address this, four workshops were held during the 28th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP28) in Dubai. These workshops gathered insights into the experiences of urban children and youth in cities affected by climate change through discussions with youth and other stakeholders present at COP28. Opportunities for creating healthier and more sustainable youth-focused cities were identified using a participatory approach. Youth facilitators led discussions between participants and an expert panel, and participants shared their experiences and perspectives of growing up in cities and their hopes for future youth-focused cities amidst a changing climate. Narrative was collected through an online collaboration tool, which was fed into an artificial intelligence tool to generate images, which served as triggers for further discussion. The thematic analysis of the narratives was conducted by a team of early-career researchers. Three themes were identified: the effects of climate change on urban youth, visions for healthier and more sustainable cities prioritising youth, and principles guiding action. The findings emphasize the importance of involving young people and representing children's needs in research and decision-making.}

Until now, it has only been possible to calculate the apparent velocity of groundwater flow in the karst system after obtaining experimental field investigation to verify e.g. the movement of pollution through the underground karst system, by applying the dye-tracing test technique using a dye tracer. The methodology for calculation of the apparent velocity of groundwater flow takes into account the measured “actual or real” travel time and shortest (air) distance (path) between sites of dye insertion and dye appearance which means that it does not include the “actual or real” distance with multidimensionality and extremely nonlinear behavior of karst system. In contrast with this methodology, the calculation of mean translational velocity is based on “actual or real” data of measured travel time and distance required that dye appears on springs from the moment when the dye was inserted in the sinkhole, and the minor and major semi-axes of the boundary ellipse. This mathematically presented novel methodology takes into account information such as measured travel time and environmental characteristics (aquifer boundaries) which makes novel methodology innovative and sustainable. Since it would be good to know the velocity as close as possible to the “actual or real” groundwater flow velocity, the paper discusses the possibility of obtaining the mean translational velocity based on theoretical calculations and improving the existing calculation of the apparent velocity of groundwater flow. Additionally, the value of this paper is a quantification of the relationships between the qualitative features of the karst system, i.e. makes them measurable contributing to SDG6.}

abstract = {The polyvagal collection of hypotheses is based upon five essential premises, as stated by its author (Porges, 2011). Polyvagal conjectures rest on a primary assumption that brainstem ventral and dorsal vagal regions in mammals each have their own unique mediating effects upon control of heart rate. The polyvagal hypotheses link these putative dorsal- vs. ventral-vagal differences to socioemotional behavior (e.g. defensive immobilization, and social affiliative behaviors, respectively), as well as to trends in the evolution of the vagus nerve (e.g. Porges, 2011 & 2021a). Additionally, it is essential to note that only one measurable phenomenon—as index of vagal processes—serves as the linchpin for virtually every premise. That phenomenon is respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart-rate changes coordinated to phase of respiration (i.e. inspiration vs. expiration), often employed as an index of vagally, or parasympathetically, mediated control of heart rate. The polyvagal hypotheses assume that RSA is a mammalian phenomenon, since Porges (2011) states “RSA has not been observed in reptiles.” I will here briefly document how each of these basic premises have been shown to be either untenable or highly implausible based on the available scientific literature. I will also argue that the polyvagal reliance upon RSA as equivalent to general vagal tone or even cardiac vagal tone is conceptually a category mistake (Ryle, 1949), confusing an approximate index (i.e. RSA) of a phenomenon (some general vagal process) with the phenomenon, itself.}

The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of WMSDs among small-scale construction workers in Namibia's capital city of Windhoek, located in Southern Africa. A cross-sectional survey in Windhoek, Namibia, involved 117 workers from four small-scale construction companies. Self-administered questionnaires and in-depth interviewing procedures were employed in the research to compile data on the occurrence of WMSDs associated with among workers in small-scale construction. Both descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings revealed the symptoms and prevalence of WMSDs in several body parts among the small-scale construction employees surveyed. The research findings further showed that 28 % of respondents lacked safety knowledge for the intention to work safely, whereas 72 % of respondents who planned to work safely indicated greater levels of safety knowledge. Age, brick size and repetitive work were the job risk factors that positively correlated with WMSDs. The results suggest for instance that as the worker ages, so do the chances to contract WMSDs. Overall, the study demonstrated that mechanical, individual, and psychosocial factors all influence the frequency of WMSDs among workers in small-scale construction. However, further research is needed to provide solutions on occupational health of small scale construction workers and on training and awareness of ergonomic risk factors in relation to WMSDs.}

In this context, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive natural language processing abilities to generate sophisticated computer code for research tasks in various domains. We report the first study on the applicability of LLMs to perform computer experiments on microstructure pattern formation in model materials. In particular, we exploit LLM’s ability to generate code for solving various types of phase-field-based partial differential equations (PDEs) that integrate additional physics to model material microstructures. The results indicate that LLMs have a remarkable capacity to generate multi-physics code and can effectively deal with materials microstructure problems up to a certain complexity. However, for complex multi-physics coupled PDEs for which a detailed understanding of the problem is required, LLMs fail to perform the task efficiently, since much more detailed instructions with many iterations of the same query are required to generate the desired output. Nonetheless, at their current stage of development and potential future advancements, LLMs offer a promising outlook for accelerating materials education and research by supporting beginners and experts in their physics-based methodology. We hope this paper will spur further interest to leverage LLMs as a supporting tool in the integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach to materials modeling and design.}

This paper explores whether there are differences in the information behaviour of high school students when choosing a higher education institution (HEI) based on the educational attainment of their parents. We focus on the social factors of information behaviour in the post-conflict society of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Design/methodology/approach
We use Bourdieu’s social theory to demonstrate the need for a deeper inclusion of the social context for a more comprehensive understanding of information behaviour, and Bronfenbrenner’s theory of human development to propose a model for social interventions to reduce information inequality. Using the concept of cultural capital (CC), Bourdieu explains the reproduction of social inequalities through the educational system. We apply this concept to explain information behaviour when choosing an HEI as a partially socially conditioned behaviour. In a quantitative study, we investigate how the institutionalized form of parents’ CC is reflected in their children’s information behaviour in selecting an HEI.
Findings
There are two different patterns of information behaviour of high school seniors when choosing an HEI based on the institutionalized CC of their parents, especially fathers. The group of respondents whose fathers have a higher academic degree shows a different “taste” in using information sources and channels compared to the group whose fathers have a lower degree. These findings suggest that the lack of CC functions as an internalized structural barrier that shapes information behaviour on an unconscious level, and that social context operates on multiple levels.
Originality/value
This is one of the first papers that applies Bourdieu’s concept of CC and Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory to understand the social dimension of information behaviour.}

abstract = {In sludge dewatering of most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the dose of polymer flocculant is manually adjusted through direct visual inspection of the flocs without the aid of any instruments. Although there is a demand for the development of automatic control of flocculant dosing, this has been challenging owing to the lack of a reliable flocculation sensor. To address this issue, this study developed a novel image sensor for measuring the degree of flocculation (DF) based on deep learning. Two types of sludge samples were used in the laboratory-scale flocculation tests: excess sludge and mixtures of excess sludge and raw wastewater. To search for a deep learning regression model suitable for DF inference, ten models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and a multilayer perceptron MLP mixer, were comparatively analysed. The ConvNeXt and MLP mixer models showed the highest accuracies with coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.9. The region contributing to the DF inference in the flocculation images was visualised using a modulus-weighted, gradient-weighted regression activation map. A prototype of the flocculation sensor was constructed using an inexpensive EdgeAI device. This device comprises a single-board computer and an integrated graphical processing unit (GPU) and is equipped with a quantised ConvNeXt model. The maximum inference speed of the sensor was 12.8 frames per second (FPS). The flocculation control tests showed that the sensor could control the DF to the target value by adjusting the polymer flocculant dose. Therefore, the flocculation sensor can provide a data-driven approach to the management of the flocculation process, thereby facilitating the automation of WWTPs.}

Traditional studies on road network vulnerability have primarily focussed on physical attacks like node or link removal, with little attention to disinformation attacks. To fill this gap, this study introduces a novel disinformation attack mode for road TCPS. It hacks navigation applications by strategically modifying the link cost information, thereby affecting drivers' routing decisions. Crucially, this attack mode leaves the physical topology of TCPS-based road networks unchanged, impacting only the cyber layer's information. Additionally, intriguing link metrics, like the partial derivative of total travel time to link flow, are introduced to identify attack targets. On this basis, we design multi-strategy disinformation attacks to assess road network vulnerability. The proposed research framework, validated by San Francisco's large-scale urban road network, reveals that disinformation attacks on just 0.12% of links could cause an annual city-wide economic loss of $79.26 million in the worst-case scenario. This study offers a unique viewpoint on road network vulnerability, emphasising the vital need for TCPS cybersecurity to ensure urban transportation's reliability and resilience.}

abstract = {Background
Early treatment is critical for improving eating disorder prognosis. Single-session interventions (SSIs) can provide short-term support to people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment; however, it is not always possible to access SSIs. We co-designed and developed a rule-based chatbot called ED ESSI (Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention), which delivered an SSI and demonstrated its acceptability and feasibility. However, the effectiveness of ED ESSI is yet to be investigated.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an SSI delivered by ED ESSI. We examined the chatbot’s impact on eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, stress, and motivation for change or treatment in individuals aged ≥16 years on waitlists for treatment for all types of eating disorders.
Methods
This multicenter 2-armed randomized controlled trial included 60 people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment in the chatbot intervention group (n=30, 50%) or the control group (n=30, 50%). The ED ESSI chatbot guided participants through a 30-minute SSI of assessment and psychoeducation, while the control group received web-based information on the same core topics covered in the SSI. There were 4 time points: before intervention or baseline (time point 1 [T1]), after intervention within 72 hours of baseline (T2), 1 month after baseline (T3), and 3 months after baseline (T4). Eating disorder pathology (primary outcome) and psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) were measured at T1, T3, and T4, and motivation for change or treatment (secondary outcome) was measured at all 4 time points. Furthermore, the System Usability Scale was implemented at T2 for the chatbot intervention group only.
Results
ED ESSI induced significantly greater reductions compared to the control group in the primary outcome of eating disorder pathology (P=.003) and secondary outcomes of psychosocial impairment (P=.008), depression (P=.002), and anxiety (P=.040) over the 1- and 3-month time points, with small to moderate effects (Cohen d=0.15-0.53). Chatbot use also induced an increase in participants’ confidence in their ability to change (secondary outcome) immediately after use (T2), with a moderate effect (P<.001; Cohen d=0.74). The chatbot was rated as “excellent” in terms of usability. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the chatbot group (28/30, 93%) entered treatment by 3 months upon the opportunity being offered to them, compared to the control group, with a moderate effect (21/30, 70%; P=.042; ϕ=0.30).
Conclusions
ED ESSI promptly induced improvements in eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety, which were detectable at 1 month and maintained to 3 months. ED ESSI potentially represents an effective, accessible, and scalable form of early intervention for people aged ≥16 years waiting for eating disorder treatment. Further research is needed to determine the longer-term effectiveness of ED ESSI.

This study examines individuals' willingness to pay to reduce automation risk, using a discrete-choice experiment conducted with nearly 6000 participants. Results reveal that respondents accept a salary reduction of almost 20 % of the Swiss median annual gross wage to reduce their automation risk by 10 percentage points or, conversely, demand a 20 % risk premium to accept an equivalent increase in automation risk. Interestingly, the study finds that WTP for risk reduction increases with higher baseline automation risk levels, contrary to patterns observed in other contexts. While preferences are generally homogeneous, differences exist between demographic groups. Men, younger and risk-tolerant individuals, and those with higher education show lower willingness to pay for reduced automation risk. By having respondents express preferences for hypothetical children, the study also explores potential gender biases, finding no significant differences in willingness to pay for reduced automation risk, educational degrees, hierarchical position, or wage based on the child's gender.}

In this study, we have designed a photo essay assignment where students recount a story in the form of photo essays and prompt AI image-generating tools to create photos for their storytelling. Drawing on interview data, written reflections, written annotations, and multimodal products from seven focal participants, we have identified two remixing practices–layering and blending–through which students attempted to establish a coherent and unique voice in writing. The study sheds light on the intentional and discursive nature of multimodal writing with AI as afforded by the technological flexibility, while also highlighting the practical and ethical challenges that could be attributed to students’ insufficient prompt and multimodal literacy and the innate limitations of AI systems. This study provides important implications for incorporating AI tools in designing multimodal writing tasks.}

Automated building energy modeling (ABEM) is significant to reduce this burden, promoting widespread adoption of building energy modeling in building design and operation practice. This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor large language models (LLMs) for ABEM. Leveraging Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) and a comprehensive training dataset (490 k samples), the proposed approach enhances LLM customization while maintaining computational efficiency. Model quantization and mixed-precision training further optimize efficiency without compromising performance. Using this approach, the developed platform (EPlus-LLMv2) can auto-generate complex buildings with varying geometries, thermal zones, materials, hourly schedules, operation settings, etc. Tests on 402 modeling cases demonstrate 100 % accuracy of modeling while reducing modeling efforts by >98 %. Additionally, an interactive human-AI interface is developed to further enhance the platform's accessibility. Finally, insights and future work to customize LLMs in ABEM and other building applications are discussed.}

The use of Eleutherococcus trifoliatus L. S. Y. Hu (E. trifoliatus) in Yi ethnomedicine to treat rheumatic diseases can be traced back hundreds of years. However, its pharmacological mechanism and possible material basis remain unknown.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study is to explore the effective components and mechanisms of E. trifoliatus in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Materials and methods
Arthritic rats induced with FCA were treated with E. trifoliatus extracts (ETPE, ETEA, ETNBA) or methotrexate (MTX) for 30 days. The arthritis index, paw edema, organ indices, histopathology, serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, PGE2, NO), and synovial MMPs/NF-κB were assessed. The active ETPE fraction was separated, and the main compound, pimaradienoic acid (PA), was identified. PA's effects on MH7A cells were evaluated using CCK-8, Transwell, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blot.
Results
ETPE significantly reduced AI scores, paw swelling, thymic/splenic indices, synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltration (p < 0.05 vs. model), and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, PGE2, NO, p < 0.05 vs. model) while increasing IL-10 in FCA rats (p < 0.05 vs. model). It also downregulated synovial MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB (p < 0.05 vs. model). A high content and active ent-pimarane diterpenoid, pimaradienoic acid (PA), was isolated from ETPE. PA inhibited MH7A proliferation (IC50 = 69.13 ± 6.82 μM), migration, invasion, and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (p < 0.01). PA treatment reduced VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, IL-1β, and NF-κB secretion (p < 0.05), downregulated Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and IKKα protein expression, and upregulated Bax (p < 0.01).
Conclusions
ETPE is the main anti-RA fraction in E. trifoliatus, contains the active constituent PA, which alleviates RA by inhibiting synoviocyte proliferation, migration, and inflammation through NF-κB suppression and apoptosis promotion. This supports E. trifoliatus' traditional use and highlights PA as a promising anti-RA candidate.}

It plays a role in regulating melanin changes and rhythmic behaviors such as sleep and feeding, though its relationship with these processes is not fully understood. Our preliminary research revealed significant differences in melanin degradation in zebrafish under varying light conditions, suggesting a link to MCH. This study aims to explore MCH's role in lighting-induced changes in rhythmic behavior patterns and melanin of zebrafish. Using the zebrafish model, we evaluated MCH expression under different lighting conditions and analyzed the effects of arousal-promoting and sleep-inducing agents. We also investigated the impact of exogenous MCH and its inhibitors on melanin degradation, behavioral changes, and differences in MCH expression to uncover potential regulatory relationships between MCH, sleep pressure, and melanin. In-depth research using flow cytometry, acridine orange staining, LysoTracker Red staining, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of autophagy- and apoptosis-related genes showed that melanin degradation regulation depends on MCH expression levels. Sleep pressure can intervene in MCH's effects, forming a regulatory loop to jointly regulate melanin degradation. The influence of the MCH-sleep pressure loop on melanin degradation is closely tied to autophagic and lysosomal pathways. Our findings reveal a mutually regulatory loop in zebrafish between MCH and sleep pressure, affecting melanin degradation through these pathways.}

Improving the prognosis of patients with melanoma requires an early and precise diagnosis. Recently, deep learning models have emerged as dominant tools in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for the categorization of potential melanoma lesions. In clinical settings, obtaining high quality skin images can be challenging due to blurry, noisy, low-contrast images that may contain extraneous objects such as rulers or hair. To overcome these challenges, the Spatio Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Network (STJGCN) was utilized to detect and classify melanoma from dermoscopy images. The input images are collected from the 2020 Challenge Dataset of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The input images are provided to Information Exchange Multi-Bernoulli-Filter (IEMBF) based pre-processing for hair noise removal, resizing, random rotations, cropping, and splitting from input dataset. The pre-processed images are provided to Spatio Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Network (STJGCN) for detecting and classifying melanoma as benign and malignant. The Red Panda Optimization Algorithm (RPOA) is used to fine-tune STJGCN parameters. The proposed EOIQ-MC-STJGCN approach is implemented in Python and various performance metrics are analyzed to assess the efficacy of the proposed approach. The proposed approach attains the highest accuracy of 97.86% in melanoma detection and classification compared to various existing approaches. By demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed EOIQ-MC-STJGCN technique, this research contributes to faster and more accurate melanoma diagnosis, ultimately facilitating earlier intervention and treatment.}

This study proposes a lightweight assessment model for transformer windings, integrating an image fusion module and a recognition module to address the accuracy limitations of single-image analysis and the high computational demands of multi-scale analysis. First, a Parallel Efficient Mixed Attention Mechanism (PEMAM) is proposed, designed to enhance adaptability to transformer vibration signals while maintaining a low parameter count. This mechanism improves the feature extraction capability of the Image Fusion Framework based on a Convolutional Neural Network, significantly boosting the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing resistance to distortion in fused images. Subsequently, multi-scale Markov field images, derived from the time and frequency domain features of vibration signals, are fused and fed into the PEMAM-enhanced recognition module for condition assessment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 99.63 % accuracy in identifying transformer winding conditions while maintaining low model complexity and computational cost.}

In this study we employ the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) checklist to evaluate the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence for Student Performance Prediction (AI4SPP), an AI-powered system designed to detect students at risk of school failure. We strongly support the ethical and legal development of AI and propose an implementation design where the user can choose to have access to each level of a three-tier outcome bundle: the AI prediction alone, the prediction along with its confidence level, and, lastly, local explanations for each grade prediction together with the previous two information. AI4SPP aims to raise awareness among educators and students regarding the factors contributing to low school performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of interventions not only to help students, but also to address biases within the school community. However, we also emphasize the ethical and legal concerns that could arise from a misuse of the AI4SPP tool. First of all, the collection and analysis of data, which is essential for the development of AI models, may lead to breaches of privacy, thus causing particularly adverse consequences in the case of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the system’s predictions may be influenced by unacceptable discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background, leading to unfair actions. The ALTAI checklist serves as a valuable self-assessment tool during the design phase of AI systems, by means of which commonly overlooked weaknesses can be highlighted and addressed. In addition, the same checklist plays a crucial role throughout the AI system life cycle. Continuous monitoring of sensitive features within the dataset, alongside survey assessments to gauge users’ responses to the systems, is essential for gathering insights and intervening accordingly. We argue that adopting a critical approach to AI development is essential for societal progress, believing that it can evolve and accelerate over time without impeding openness to new technologies. By aligning with ethical principles and legal requirements, AI systems can make significant contributions to education while mitigating potential risks and ensuring a fair and inclusive learning environment.}

Several studies have depicted an essential role for dampened mitophagy and mitochondrial injury in Dox cardiotoxicity. However, preventative measure to alleviate Dox-evoked cardiotoxicity via targeting mitophagy and mitochondrial integrity remains elusive. Urolithin A (UA) is a newly identified mitophagy inducer with antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties although its effect on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is unknown. This study was designed to explore the effect of UA on Dox cardiotoxicity and mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that UA alleviated Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction exhibited by echocardiographic parameters and histological analyses, and partially relieved Dox-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and mitochondrial dysfunction including ΔΨm dissipation and ROS production in vitro. The ability of UA to facilitate restoration of mitophagy in mice and H9C2s underscored its advantageous effects, manifested as upregulation of mitophagy-related proteins, including p62, LC3, PINK1 and Parkin, as well as the co-location between LC3 and mitochondria. Incubation with 3 -MA nearly reversed the UA-evoked rise of mitophagy-related proteins, and inhibition of apoptosis. Given that knockdown of Ambra1 almost abolished UA-induced protective effect, the enhanced expression of Ambra1 owing to UA increased PINK1 levels by inhibiting its degradation via LONP1. Collectively, our results suggest that the cardioprotective properties of UA depend on the stimulation of PINK1-dependent mitophagy through promoting Ambra1 expression to inhibit PINK1 degradation by LONP1. This highlights UA's potential as a valuable treatment option and its importance in cardioprotective strategies against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.}

abstract = {Background
In the United States, 1 in 5 adults currently serves as a family caregiver for an individual with a serious illness or disability. Unlike professional caregivers, family caregivers often assume this role without formal preparation or training. Thus, there is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of family caregivers to provide quality care. Leveraging technology as an educational tool or an adjunct to care is a promising approach that has the potential to enhance the learning and caregiving capabilities of family caregivers. Large language models (LLMs) can potentially be used as a foundation technology for supporting caregivers. An LLM can be categorized as a foundation model (FM), which is a large-scale model trained on a broad data set that can be adapted to a range of different domain tasks. Despite their potential, FMs have the critical weakness of “hallucination,” where the models generate information that can be misleading or inaccurate. Information reliability is essential when language models are deployed as front-line help tools for caregivers.
Objective
This study aimed to (1) develop a reliable caregiving language model (CaLM) by using FMs and a caregiving knowledge base, (2) develop an accessible CaLM using a small FM that requires fewer computing resources, and (3) evaluate the model’s performance compared with a large FM.
Methods
We developed a CaLM using the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework combined with FM fine-tuning for improving the quality of FM answers by grounding the model on a caregiving knowledge base. The key components of the CaLM are the caregiving knowledge base, a fine-tuned FM, and a retriever module. We used 2 small FMs as candidates for the foundation of the CaLM (LLaMA [large language model Meta AI] 2 and Falcon with 7 billion parameters) and adopted a large FM (GPT-3.5 with an estimated 175 billion parameters) as a benchmark. We developed the caregiving knowledge base by gathering various types of documents from the internet. We focused on caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. We evaluated the models’ performances using the benchmark metrics commonly used in evaluating language models and their reliability for providing accurate references with their answers.
Results
The RAG framework improved the performance of all FMs used in this study across all measures. As expected, the large FM performed better than the small FMs across all metrics. Interestingly, the small fine-tuned FMs with RAG performed significantly better than GPT 3.5 across all metrics. The fine-tuned LLaMA 2 with a small FM performed better than GPT 3.5 (even with RAG) in returning references with the answers.
Conclusions
The study shows that a reliable and accessible CaLM can be developed using small FMs with a knowledge base specific to the caregiving domain.}

Advancements in noninvasive surface and internal imaging techniques, along with computational methods, have revolutionized 3D visualization of organismal morphology—enhancing research, medical anatomical analysis, and facilitating the preservation and digital archiving of scientific specimens. We introduce the SmARTR pipeline (Small Animal Realistic Three-dimensional Rendering), a comprehensive workflow integrating wet lab procedures, 3D data acquisition, and processing to produce photorealistic scientific data through 3D cinematic rendering. This versatile pipeline supports multiscale visualizations—from tissue-level to whole-organism details across diverse living organisms—and is adaptable to various imaging sources. Its modular design and customizable rendering scenarios, enabled by the global illumination modeling and programming modules available in the free MeVisLab software and seamlessly integrated into detailed SmARTR networks, make it a powerful tool for 3D data analysis. Accessible to a broad audience, the SmARTR pipeline serves as a valuable resource across multiple life science research fields and for education, diagnosis, outreach, and artistic endeavors.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emphasizes the concept of medicine food homology (MFH), which integrates dietary therapy into health care. However, the practical application of MFH principles relies heavily on expert knowledge and manual interpretation, posing challenges for automating MFH-based dietary recommendations. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in health care decision support, their performance in specialized domains such as TCM is often hindered by hallucinations and a lack of domain knowledge. The integration of uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) with LLMs via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising solution to overcome these limitations by enabling a structured and faithful representation of MFH principles while enhancing LLMs’ ability to understand the inherent uncertainty and heterogeneity of TCM knowledge. Consequently, it holds potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of MFH-based dietary recommendations generated by LLMs.
Objective
This study aimed to introduce Yaoshi-RAG, a framework that leverages UKGs to enhance LLMs' capabilities in generating accurate and personalized MFH-based dietary recommendations.
Methods
The proposed framework began by constructing a comprehensive MFH knowledge graph (KG) through LLM-driven open information extraction, which extracted structured knowledge from multiple sources. To address the incompleteness and uncertainty within the MFH KG, UKG reasoning was used to measure the confidence of existing triples and to complete missing triples. When processing user queries, query entities were identified and linked to the MFH KG, enabling retrieval of relevant reasoning paths. These reasoning paths were then ranked based on triple confidence scores and entity importance. Finally, the most informative reasoning paths were encoded into prompts using prompt engineering, enabling the LLM to generate personalized dietary recommendations that aligned with both individual health needs and MFH principles. The effectiveness of Yaoshi-RAG was evaluated through both automated metrics and human evaluation.
Results
The constructed MFH KG comprised 24,984 entities, 22 relations, and 29,292 triples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Yaoshi-RAG in different evaluation metrics. Integrating the MFH KG significantly improved the performance of LLMs, yielding an average increase of 14.5% in Hits@1 and 8.7% in F1-score, respectively. Among the evaluated LLMs, DeepSeek-R1 achieved the best performance, with 84.2% in Hits@1 and 71.5% in F1-score, respectively. Human evaluation further validated these results, confirming that Yaoshi-RAG consistently outperformed baseline models across all assessed quality dimensions.
Conclusions
This study shows Yaoshi-RAG, a new framework that enhances LLMs’ capabilities in generating MFH-based dietary recommendations through the knowledge retrieved from a UKG. By constructing a comprehensive TCM knowledge representation, our framework effectively extracts and uses MFH principles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in synthesizing traditional wisdom with advanced language models, facilitating personalized dietary recommendations that address individual health conditions while providing evidence-based explanations.}

A comprehensive calculation and in-depth analysis of the ecological niche of open innovation ecosystem and basic ecological niche in 30 provincial-level administrative regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Tibet) are carried out. The research results not only reveal the significant differences in the suitability of innovation ecological niche among different provincial-level administrative regions, but also show the complex relationship between ecological niche suitability and evolutionary momentum, as well as the different characteristics and development trends of each basic ecological niche. Compared to traditional measurement methods, the large model approach adopted in this study demonstrates significant advantages: (1) It is capable of processing massive and complex datasets, capturing the dynamic changes within innovation ecosystems; (2) By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, it effectively addresses the vanishing gradient problem inherent in traditional RNN models, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy; (3) In conjunction with fitness models, it provides a more comprehensive assessment of the internal mechanisms and external environmental factors of innovation ecosystems. This research provides important theoretical basis and empirical support for in-depth understanding of the innovation ecosystem in various provincial-level administrative regions of China, and helps to better grasp the pattern and direction of national innovation development and provide a powerful reference for formulating scientific and reasonable innovation policies.}

It assesses existing methods to mitigate biases and improve decision-making, introducing the novel “Impostor Bias”, which arises as a systematic tendency to question the authenticity of multimedia content, such as audio, images, and videos, often assuming they are generated by AI tools. This bias goes beyond evaluators' knowledge levels, as it can lead to erroneous judgments and false accusations, undermining the reliability and credibility of forensic evidence. Impostor Bias stems from an a priori assumption rather than an objective content assessment, and its impact is expected to grow with the increasing realism of AI-generated multimedia products. The paper discusses the potential causes and consequences of Impostor Bias, suggesting strategies for prevention and counteraction.

This study compared the functional response of plant communities on soil-bioengineered riverbanks with those on natural and hard-engineered (ripraps) riverbanks across 124 sites in Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that the Community Weighted Means (CWM) of 10 functional traits and three ecological attributes relevant in a riparian context and based on 356 plant taxa would be similar between bioengineered and natural sites, while functional diversity measured as richness (FRic) and dispersion (FDis) would be higher in bioengineered sites due to the diverse conditions (substrate, microhabitats). Contrary to expectations, we found trait-specific results. Compared to ripraps, natural sites were dominated by plants that were taller and had lighter seeds, as well as higher dispersion in specific leaf area, height, and seed mass, higher FRic, more dispersion of propagules by water and less by animals, and more plants with vegetative reproduction, shade tolerance, wetland-affinity, native, and fewer ruderal species. Bioengineered sites had intermediate mean trait values and dispersion, and only small differences among the three techniques applied (pure, keyed, and mixed) regarding the proportion of living and mineral material. Consistent with a previous study that used the same set of sites, we found higher plant cover, species richness, and diversity in natural sites compared to ripraps, with bioengineered sites falling in between the two. Bioengineering can partially reproduce natural riparian plant communities both taxonomically and functionally. Practitioners should consider functional diversity in their designs.}

One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the Distribution System Operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modeled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.}

IED is associated with a host of cognitive and affective symptoms not included in the diagnostic criteria which may be a valuable indicator of heterogeneity in IED—such information can be useful to enhance understanding and treatment of this disorder in mental health settings. A preliminary investigation conducted on cognitive-affective symptom heterogeneity in individuals with a history of IED demonstrated that level of emotional dysregulation primarily differentiated IED subgroups, however the sample size was limited, and almost half of the individuals did not have current IED (only lifetime IED). The present study addressed these limitations by conducting a latent class analysis of cognitive-affective symptoms among a large (n = 504) sample of individuals diagnosed with current IED. The latent IED classes were then externally validated on several adverse outcomes, historical precursors, and demographic variables. Statistical and clinical indicators supported a four-class model, with classes primarily distinguished by patients' severity of emotion dysregulation. The two moderate emotion-dysregulated classes both endorsed callous-unemotional traits and low empathy relative to other classes, a finding which differs from the initial investigation. An external validation of the four classes revealed that they significantly differed on severity outcomes (e.g., aggression, suicide attempts, antisocial behavior, global functioning, comorbidities) and historical precursors (e.g., aversive parental care, childhood maltreatment). These findings provide further insight into the heterogeneity within IED and the associations of such variability with important precursors and clinical outcomes.}

Caregivers of children with mental health challenges are at heightened risk for burnout and absenteeism. This strain affects both their well-being and work performance, contributing to widespread workplace issues. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are increasingly used to support pediatric mental health, but their impact on caregiver outcomes remains underexplored.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the associations between caregiver burnout, absenteeism (ie, missing work), comorbid symptoms, and child mental health problems, and to assess whether caregiver burnout and absenteeism improved as their child participated in a pediatric DMHI.
Methods
This retrospective study included 6506 caregivers whose children (aged 1‐17 years) received care from Bend Health, Inc, a pediatric DMHI providing digital-based therapy and coaching, digital content, and caregiver support. Caregiver burnout, absenteeism, comorbid symptoms, and child mental health symptoms were measured by monthly assessments. Cumulative link models were used to assess the associations of between child symptoms and caregiver outcomes and to assess changes in caregiver outcomes over the course of the DMHI. Analyses of baseline associations included the full sample (n=6506), while analyses of pre-post changes in caregiver outcomes were conducted in caregivers with elevated burnout (n=2121) and absenteeism (n=1327) who had an assessment after starting care.
Results
At baseline, 45.96% (2990/6506) of caregivers reported elevated burnout and 28.96% (1884/6506) reported elevated absenteeism. More severe burnout was associated with having a child with elevated symptoms of any type (all P<.01). More severe absenteeism was significantly associated with having a child with elevated symptoms of depression (z=3.33; P<.001), anxiety (z=3.96; P<.001), inattention (z=2.48; P=.013), and hyperactivity (z=2.12; P=.03). Burnout decreased for 68.64% (1456/2121) and absenteeism decreased for 87.26% (1158/ 1327). Greater months in care was associated with less severe caregiver burnout (z=−5.48; P<.001) and absenteeism (z=−6.74; P<.001).
Conclusions
DMHIs for children may reduce caregiver burnout and absenteeism. These findings emphasize the value of employers offering pediatric DMHIs as part of employee benefits, potentially enhancing workplace outcomes.}

By examining how and to what extent different visual patterns build up unique characteristics of cities, we propose a data-driven framework to measure visual uniqueness in terms of identity and distinctiveness. We performed bottom-up visual clustering on Google Street View (GSV) images in the six most visited Japanese cities. We found that 8 representative visual clusters explain each city's visual identity and relative distinctiveness. This research demonstrates how artificial intelligence applied to visual data can reveal subtle differences in urban environments. In the era of growing globalization, with frequent tourism and intercity visits, the cultivation of a city's unique visual characteristics can help avoid the homogenization of urban landscapes, and stimulate the development of urban tourism by shaping an imageable city.}

This study employs a cross-sectional quantitative design to examine the relationships between SDL, AL, and CT in the context of adult learners' use of GenAI tools like ChatGPT. It considers how demographic variables moderate these relationships. The study was underpinned by the SDL theory by Tough in 1971. An analysis of 281 survey responses of adult learners grouped by generation from five (5) adult higher education institutions in Ghana was performed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA (analysis of variance), and SEM (structural equation modeling). The study’s findings indicate that GenAI is perceived as having a significant positive effect on the SDL, AL, and CT of adult learners. A significant positive interrelationship was observed between SDL, AL, and CT. Demographic factors involving gender, year born (generational group), education level, and mode of learning had a perceived significant positive effect on SDL, AL, and CT. Notably, no statistical mean differences were found in the use of GenAI for SDL, AL, and CT across generational groups. The findings advocate for the effective adoption of GenAI to foster lifelong learning among adult learners.

abstract = {Background
Sleep health is a multidimensional construct that includes objective and subjective parameters and is influenced by individual sleep-related behaviors and sleep disorders. Symptom network analysis allows modeling of the interactions between variables, enabling both the visualization of relationships between different factors and the identification of the strength of those relationships. Given the known influence of sex and age on sleep health, network analysis can help explore sets of mutually interacting symptoms relative to these demographic variables.
Objective
This study aimed to study the centrality of symptoms and compare age and sex differences regarding sleep health using a symptom network approach in a large French population that feels concerned about their sleep.
Methods
Data were extracted from a questionnaire provided by the Réseau Morphée health network. A network analysis was conducted on 39 clinical variables related to sleep disorders and sleep health. After network estimation, statistical analyses consisted of calculating inferences of centrality, robustness (ie, testifying to a sufficient effect size), predictability, and network comparison. Sleep clinical variable centralities within the networks were analyzed by both sex and age using 4 age groups (18-30, 31-45, 46-55, and >55 years), and local symptom-by-symptom correlations determined.
Results
Data of 35,808 participants were obtained. The mean age was 42.7 (SD 15.7) years, and 24,964 (69.7%) were women. Overall, there were no significant differences in the structure of the symptom networks between sexes or age groups. The most central symptoms across all groups were nonrestorative sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In the youngest group, additional central symptoms were chronic circadian misalignment and chronic sleep deprivation (related to sleep behaviors), particularly among women. In the oldest group, leg sensory discomfort and breath abnormality complaint were among the top 4 central symptoms. Symptoms of sleep disorders thus became more central with age than sleep behaviors. The high predictability of central nodes in one of the networks underlined its importance in influencing other nodes.
Conclusions
The absence of structural difference between networks is an important finding, given the known differences in sleep between sexes and across age groups. These similarities suggest comparable interactions between clinical sleep variables across sexes and age groups and highlight the implication of common sleep and wake neural circuits and circadian rhythms in understanding sleep health. More precisely, nonrestorative sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness are central symptoms in all groups. The behavioral component is particularly central in young people and women. Sleep-related respiratory and motor symptoms are prominent in older people. These results underscore the importance of comprehensive sleep promotion and screening strategies tailored to sex and age to impact sleep health.}

The analysis yielded the following results: (1) Based on their learning performance, primary school students were identified as three distinct clusters: programming specialized unit (PSU), high performance unit (HPU), and low performance unit (LPU). (2) Regarding SRL behaviors, students prioritized self-control (65.8 %), followed by self-observation (19 %), task analysis (12.1 %), and behavior stagnation (3.2 %). (3) Students in PSU and HPU consistently adopted goal-oriented SRL strategies, whereas students in LPU exhibited passive dependence and fragmented strategy use. GenAI's facilitative effect in supporting learning correlated with users' SRL capabilities. (4) Students in PSU and HPU exhibited frequent transitions between SRL behaviors, whereas students in LPU had insufficient ability to switch strategies when facing programming difficulties. Based on these findings, this study proposed four forward-looking design recommendations: effectively integrating GenAI with the programming environment, utilizing multimodal data and AI for learning assessment and feedback, building a cluster-driven early warning mechanism, and conducting dynamic SRL analysis and guidance based on fine-grained time-series data.}

To address these challenges, this paper validates a remote English learning strategy system through comparative experiments, focusing on four dimensions: goal management, multimodal learning, interactive reinforcement, and motivation maintenance. The results show significant improvements in learners' English proficiency, motivation, and retention rates, providing valuable insights for optimizing curriculum design. In summary, the proposed strategy system offers effective learning methods and references for both learners and educational institutions. Future research and practice are expected to further explore and refine this area,}

abstract = {Pastoralism is a cornerstone of the argan forest ecosystem in Morocco, where the argan tree supports food production and livelihoods. However, overbrowsing threatens this ecosystem, underscoring the need for sustainable management strategies. This study assessed the impact of three browsing intensities on argan trees in the Essaouira region: no-browsing, moderate-browsing (managed browsing or the Agdal system), and heavy-browsing systems. Measurements of argan physiological and biochemical traits and soil parameters revealed significant differences among the three-browsing intensities. Heavily browsed argan trees exhibited reduced photosynthetic efficiency, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic pigments content, and leaf area index, while no-browsing system maintained optimal performances. The Agdal strategy significantly enhanced plant health compared to heavy browsing, improving physiological indicators and soil quality. Soil traits including electrical conductivity, moisture, and organic matter and total nitrogen content were notably better under managed browsing, promoting healthier argan ecosystems. Additionally, browsing intensity affected leaf biochemistry: overbrowsing induced a decline in protein content, while it enhanced total soluble sugars, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide content, and antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase), reflecting heightened stress responses. Overall, even if the non-browsed trees performed best, the moderate-browsing system (Agdal) may be the most suitable of the three browsing systems, since it will be able to meet goats’ feed needs while ensuring the sustainability of the argan forest ecosystem.}

In an online introductory economics course, learners applied economic theory to seek solutions to anomalous outcomes in markets or policy. While puzzles have been used in seminars for decades, this novel approach brings structure and rigor to using economic puzzles in an online course, stimulating participation and active learning by using elements of gamification to provide ongoing progress updates and an incentive to solve a final mystery for course credit. This approach requires no specialized software beyond a learning management system (LMS) and a method of digital communication, either in the LMS or via email. This approach was utilized in online AP Microeconomics courses but could be applicable to a variety of subjects and levels within economics.}

abstract = {Background
There has been controversy over the extent to which technology use in general—and social media exposure specifically—may be associated with adverse youth mental health outcomes. To date, studies have generally been small and exploratory, relying on youth self-reports to characterize technology and social media use patterns. The goal of this study is to explore the associations between objectively collected data, gathered through a commercially available app, and youth mental health outcomes.
Objective
The broad goal of this study is to characterize the association between objectively measured technology/social media use and a range of mental health–related outcomes. Three specific aims will be initially addressed. First, we aim to quantify the association between objectively measured smartphone use and measures of well-being. Second, we aim to differentiate types of engagement—specifically, the types of content consumed versus the overall time spent on the device—and examine their association with outcomes. Third, we aim to identify moderating factors, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, that might influence these relationships. A secondary broad objective of this research is to establish a freely available data resource that can be accessed by qualified investigators to address a much wider range of questions in the future.
Methods
Up to 1000 male, female, and nonbinary youth aged 8-17 years (inclusive), along with their primary caregivers, will be enrolled in the study. Youth participants must have their own dedicated iOS- or Android-based smartphone or tablet, and both they and their parents must be willing and able to download and install the data collection app on their devices. The study is open to all US-based participants who meet these 2 criteria. Following electronic consent (eConsent), participants and their caregivers will complete a range of baseline measures electronically, including assessments of psychiatric and social functioning, as well as measures of loneliness, digital stress, and disordered eating. Caregivers will be asked to provide information on the participant’s health and mental health history. Youth and caregivers will then complete a similar battery of assessments 1, 2, and 3 months after baseline. Youth participants will also respond to daily questions about their mood, stress, physical activity, and sleep. Both youth and their caregivers will be compensated for completing measures at each time point. The data collection app gathers a wide range of daily data from the participant’s device, including temporal patterns of use, the number and frequency of various app usage, social interactions within apps, and keystroke data. A variety of analytic methods will be used to address key questions related to how technology and social media use are associated with mental health and wellness outcomes.
Results
Enrollment for this study began on November 13, 2024. As of May 20, 2025, a total of 106 participants and their caregivers had consented to participate and provided baseline data. An additional 203 children and parents have consented and are currently undergoing eligibility verification and enrollment. Initial data analysis is anticipated to begin in late autumn 2025 or winter 2026, with the expected publication of initial findings in spring 2026.
Conclusions
This study will be among the largest to date to collect both objective device usage data and validated, clinically relevant outcome measures. In accordance with our data-sharing policies, any qualified investigator will be able to access the study data, provided appropriate steps are followed.

The use of synthetic data is a widely discussed and promising solution for privacy-preserving medical research. Synthetic data may, however, not always rule out the risk of re-identifying characteristics of real patients and can vary greatly in terms of data fidelity and utility. We systematically evaluate the trade-offs between privacy, fidelity, and utility across five synthetic data models and three patient-level datasets. We evaluate fidelity based on statistical similarity to the real data, utility on three machine learning use cases, and privacy via membership inference, singling out, and attribute inference risks. Synthetic data without differential privacy (DP) maintained fidelity and utility without evident privacy breaches, whereas DP-enforced models significantly disrupted correlation structures. K-anonymity-based data sanitization of demographic features, while preserving fidelity, introduced notable privacy risks. Our findings emphasize the need to advance methods that effectively balance privacy, fidelity, and utility in synthetic patient data generation.}

abstract = {Post-earthquake damage assessment of bridge portfolios faces challenges in balancing efficiency and accuracy. While machine learning offers a promising solution, it often faces difficulties due to complex damage scenarios and imbalanced data, where safe samples vastly outnumber those requiring inspection or classified as dangerous. This imbalance limits the performance of machine learning models. To address these issues, this study proposes a rapid seismic damage assessment method for bridge portfolios using a SMOTE-enhanced XGBoost model. By utilizing bridge parameters and seismic data, this method eliminates the need for time-consuming on-site inspections, enabling quick and accurate predictions of bridge safety and traffic capacity. SMOTE is used to generate synthetic samples for all categories, with sampling ratios carefully adjusted to determine the optimal configuration that maximizes accuracy and improves data balance. The enhanced XGBoost model is then trained on the balanced dataset to classify bridge conditions, effectively mitigating the impact of class imbalance. The study also compares the performance of XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost on both original and SMOTE-balanced datasets. Results indicate that the SMOTE-enhanced XGBoost model achieves a best accuracy of 83.3 %–87.5 %. This study integrates oversampling techniques with machine learning and proposes an automated modeling framework for imbalanced data. Its key innovation lies in the automatic determination of the optimal oversampling ratio, which is incorporated into the XGBoost training process to significantly improve classification performance and generalization ability, providing reliable support for emergency response and functional recovery.}

As a result of the rapidly changing external environment, diverse types of cooperatives have emerged. However, a comprehensive understanding of the organizational structures, including ownership, control, and benefit rights, of different types of cooperatives, is limited. This study analyzes the organizational structures of two types of cooperatives in China: entrepreneur-led cooperatives and government-led cooperatives. Qualitative methodology was used in this study, including semi-structured interviews with four green vegetable production cooperatives in Shandong province. Results reveal the structural differences between these two types of case cooperatives. Despite the shared ownership, control, and benefit rights among members, entrepreneur-led cooperatives are characterized by the dominance of core members in capital contribution, control rights, and dividend distribution; whereas government-led cooperatives distribute those rights more equally among all members. The findings in this study present a more comprehensive landscape of the organizational structures of China’s cooperatives. Empirically, it demonstrates how cooperatives can evolve and vary across laws and cultures, even within the same legislative background. Additionally, it offers crucial insights for these cooperatives to develop and sustain long-term vitality.}

keywords = {information searching, credibility, internet, medicine, information search skills},
abstract = {Background
Nowadays, the internet has become the primary source of information for physicians seeking answers to medical questions about their patients before consulting colleagues. However, many websites provide low-quality, unreliable information that lacks scientific validation. Therefore, physicians must develop strong information search skills to locate relevant, accurate, and evidence-based content. However, previous studies have shown that physicians often have poor search skills and struggle to find information on the web, which may have detrimental consequences for patient care.
Objective
This study aims to determine how medical students and residents searched for medical information on the internet, the quality of the web resources they used (including their nature and credibility), and how they evaluated the reliability of these resources and the answers they provided. Given the importance of domain knowledge (in this case, medicine) and information search skills in the search process, we compared the search behaviors of medical students and residents with those of computer science students. While medical students and residents possess greater medical-related knowledge, computer science students have stronger information search skills.
Methods
A total of 20 students participated in this study: 10 medical students and residents, and 10 computer science students. Data were extracted from a freely accessible data set in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. All participants searched for medical information online to make a diagnosis, select a treatment, and enhance their knowledge of a medical condition—3 primary activities they commonly perform. We analyzed search performance metrics, including search time, the use of medical-related keywords, and the accuracy of the information found, as well as the nature and credibility of web resources used by medical students and residents compared with computer science students.
Results
Medical students and residents provided more accurate answers than computer science students without requiring additional time. Their medical expertise also enabled them to better assess the reliability of resources and select high-quality web sources, primarily from hospital websites. However, it is noteworthy that they made limited use of evidence-based tools such as PubMed.
Conclusions
Although medical students and residents generally outperformed computer science students, they did not frequently use evidence-based tools. As previously observed, they may avoid databases due to the risk of encountering too many irrelevant articles and difficulties in applying appropriate filters to locate relevant information. Nevertheless, clinical and practical evidence-based medicine plays a crucial role in updating physicians’ knowledge, improving patient care, and enhancing physician-patient relationships. Therefore, information search skills should be an integral part of medical education and continuing professional development for physicians.}

Existing research suggests that ligands for the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels may carry a risk of abuse. To evaluate the abuse potential of crisugabalin, five well-recognized animal models were utilized in these preclinical studies. Firstly, an intravenous self-administration paradigm was implemented in rats that were self-administering propofol to assess the reinforcing effects of crisugabalin. Secondly, a rat drug discrimination study was employed to determine the pharmacological similarity between crisugabalin and the training drug midazolam. Then, a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in rats was utilized to evaluate the rewarding properties of crisugabalin. After that, a spontaneous withdrawal study was conducted in rats chronically treated with crisugabalin to examine the liability of developing physical dependence. Finally, a mouse pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model was used following chronic exposure to crisugabalin to assess its potential for physical dependence. The results indicated that crisugabalin showed no positive reinforcing effects and did not display midazolam-like discriminative stimulus effects. Moreover, crisugabalin did not induce significant CPP in rats and there was no risk of physical dependence in the pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model. In the rat spontaneous withdrawal study, crisugabalin demonstrated a very low level of physical dependence. These findings suggest that crisugabalin has minimal to no potential for abuse, thereby establishing itself as a safer option relative to pregabalin and mirogabalin.}

The results based on mediation and moderation tests show that algorithm appreciation plays a mediating role among the perceived news value, the perceived recommendation personalization, the perceived recommendation explainability and the continuance usage intention. Algorithm fatigue plays a mediating role among users' perceived information narrowing, perceived content low quality, perceived information overload and continuance usage intention. Privacy concerns negatively moderate the positive effect of algorithm appreciation on continuance usage intention, while positively moderating the negative effect of algorithm fatigue on continuance usage intention. To enhance users' continuance usage intention recommended news apps, it is necessary to pay attention to the two emotional elements of algorithm appreciation and algorithm fatigue, thereby improving user experience, and achieving a win-win situation between the platform and users.}

However, our understanding of the effect of lipid nanostructure on interactions of NCs with bacteria is lacking. Herein, we investigate the interactions of four different lipid NCs (including both cubosomes and hexosomes) with a simple bacterial supported lipid bilayer (SLB) mimicking the lipid bilayer of Escherichia coli (E. coli) using a combination of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF-M), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS). Addition of the fusogenic lipid di-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) increased interactions with the SLB, while addition of the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) significantly increased interactions. The QCM-D data and SR-SAXS data indicate that mixing of the particles with E. coli mimicking model layers results in significant disruption to the cubosome structure, while hexosomes remain essentially structurally intact. We propose that the interaction mechanism with bacterial membranes differs among lipid NCs; while cubosomes primarily fuse with the lipid bilayer resulting in a loss of internal nanostructure, hexosomes interact with bacterial membranes via a different mechanism which allows them to retain structural integrity.}

Dam-breaks are complete if the dam is totally and suddenly removed, or partial if the breach is smaller than the dam. While the behaviour of dam-break waves following the complete structural failure has been extensively studied, research on partial dam break scenarios remains limited. A special partial dam break scenario, consisting of a breach opening at the dam bottom, can be modelled in laboratory experiments with the sudden partial lifting of a sluice gate. Until now, the mathematical and numerical modelling of this partial dam break has received only partial scrutiny, and it is still unclear if the solutions predicted by existing models are those effectively observed in real-world scenarios or laboratory experiments. This study addresses these gaps by confronting the results of the analytical and numerical models proposed by Cozzolino et al. (2023) with recent laboratory experimental data from the literature. The comparison reveals that the inviscid exact solution to the partial dam break problem can reliably predict the type, number, and height of the moving waves developed under both free and submerged flow conditions. The agreement with experimental data is enhanced when applying the numerical model by Cozzolino et al. (2023), owing to the inclusion of dissipative effects through the frictional term. These results advocate extending the existing flow gate equations, usually found in steady flow conditions, to the case of strong transients. The findings further corroborate the application of the Shallow water Equations to the simulation of strong transients in open channels, even in the presence of flow-structure interactions such as those involving sluice gates, bridges, and flood control barrages.}

This systematic review aims to determine potential metabolic biomarkers and pathways linked to DRE, which could inform personalized treatment and optimize therapeutic outcomes. A comprehensive search of databases, namely Medline, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded 29 eligible studies after full-text screening. The risk of bias from these studies was reviewed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating tool. Key information, including study groups, sample size, model types, and main findings were tabulated. Several metabolites were identified, including amino acids (glycine, glutamate, isoleucine), organic acids (lactate), and glucose, which may serve as potential biomarkers for DRE. MetaboAnalyst 6.0 pathway analysis identified the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, as well as phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways, emerged with significant impact score (≥0.5, p < 0.05). The findings highlight the promising role of these metabolites and pathways as predictive biomarkers for DRE and potential therapeutic targets for novel drug development.}

abstract = {Reconstructing visual stimuli from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a complex challenge in neuroscience. Most existing approaches rely on mapping neural signals to pretrained models to generate latent variables, which are then used to reconstruct images via a diffusion model. However, this multi-step process can result in the loss of crucial semantic details, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel brain decoding framework, called Memory Recall (MR), inspired by bionic brain mechanisms. MR mimics the human visual perception process, where the brain retrieves stored visual experiences to compensate for incomplete visual cues. Initially, low- and high-level visual cues are extracted using spatial mapping techniques based on VAE and CLIP, replicating the brain’s ability to interpret degraded stimuli. A visual experience database is then created to retrieve complementary information that enriches these high-level representations, simulating the brain’s memory retrieval process. Finally, an Attentive Visual Signal Fusion Network (AVSFN) with a novel attention scoring mechanism integrates the retrieved information, enhancing the generative model’s performance and emulating the brain’s refinement of visual perception. Experimental results show that MR outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple evaluation metrics and subjective assessments. Moreover, our results provide new evidence supporting a well-known psychological conclusion that the basic information capacity of short-term memory is four items, further demonstrating the informativeness and interpretability of our model.}

abstract = {Background
“Am I hungry? Did I overeat at lunch?” Gastric interoception - the sensing, interpretation, and regulation of signals from the gastrointestinal system - is central to daily behavior and homeostasis. Dysfunctional gastric interoception has been proposed as a maintenance factor in both eating disorders and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, no qualitative research has explored how individuals across these groups, and the general population, subjectively experience gastrointestinal signals, known as gastric interoceptive sensibility. This study aimed to investigate how gastric sensations are sensed, interpreted, and regulated among individuals with eating disorders, gastric disorders, and those without such diagnoses, focusing on identifying shared experiences. Methods: Fifteen semi-structured focus groups (n = 96) were conducted. Transcripts underwent hybrid deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Findings: Four key themes were identified. In “Sensations in the Interoceptive Body”, participants described hunger and fullness as physically aversive or reported an absence of cues related to satiation. “Perceiving the Interoceptive Body” captured the noticing, interpreting, attending to, and reacting to sensations of hunger, satiation, and fullness. In “Affective Experiences of the Interoceptive Body”, participants discussed how these sensations influenced emotional states positively, negatively, or not at all. “Responding to the Interoceptive Body” described participants strategies relating to relief-seeking, compensation, acceptance, distraction, and body checking in response to gastric sensations. Discussion: These findings shed light on the nuanced components of gastric interoceptive sensibility and suggest that individuals vary in how they experience and manage gastric signals. This work may inform interoceptive exposure therapies targeting maladaptive interpretations and regulation strategies in eating and gastrointestinal symptoms.}

This study aims to explore the impact and mechanisms of an online summer camp incorporating generative AI (GenAI)-enabled microteaching lesson study on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) of prospective secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs).
Design/methodology/approach
A mixed-methods research approach was employed, with 21 PSMTs participating in a 9-day online summer camp that included two rounds of microteaching lesson study, expert lectures, plenary discussions, and group discussions. Data were collected using pre- and post-mathematics-specific TPACK scales, teaching artifacts, and qualitative reflections to evaluate the evolution of PSMTs’ TPACK and identify key influencing factors.
Findings
The study reveals statistically significant improvements across all sub-domains of the TPACK framework among PSMTs. The degree of improvement in the TPACK sub-domain varied among participants, with some experiencing significant enhancement, others moderate gains, and a few showing smaller changes. The study identifies four critical factors driving TPACK development: expert guidance, practical exploration, collaborative learning, and ongoing reflection, which enhanced PSMTs’ incorporation of digital technologies (e.g. GeoGebra, GenAI) into their teaching practices.
Research limitations/implications
This study demonstrates that incorporating GenAI into microteaching lesson study significantly enhances TPACK, thereby highlighting its potential for structured, scaffolded teacher professional development. Additionally, the study shows that online formats can effectively support teachers’ TPACK development, offering a replicable model for future programs.
Originality/value
This study innovatively incorporates GenAI into microteaching lesson study, offering a novel approach to enhance PSMTs’ TPACK. It also validates a mathematics-specific TPACK scale and identifies key factors for effective teacher professional development in technology-integrated environment.}

Early detection of SAD lays the foundation for the introduction of early interventions. However, due to the nature of social avoidance in social anxiety, the screening is challenging in the clinical setting. Classic questionnaires also bear the limitations of subjectivity, memory biases under repeated measures, and cultural influence. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop a reliable and easily accessible tool to be widely used for social anxiety screening. Here, we developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS) based on generative multi-modal foundation artificial intelligence (AI) models, containing a total of 279 social pictures and 118 control pictures. Social scenarios were constructed to represent core SAD triggers such as fear of negative evaluation, social interactions, and performance anxiety, mapping to specific dimensions of social anxiety to capture its multifaceted nature. Pictures devoid of social interactions were included as a control, aiming to reveal response patterns specific to social scenarios and to improve the system’s precision in predicting social anxiety traits. Through laboratory and online experiments, we collected ratings on SAIPS from five dimensions. Machine learning results showed that ratings on SAIPS robustly reflected and predicted an individual’s trait of social anxiety, especially social anxiety and arousal ratings. The prediction was reliable, even based on a short version with less than 30 pictures. Together, SAIPS may serve as a promising tool to support social anxiety screening and longitudinal predictions.}

Higher loading of active electrode materials is desired in batteries, especially those based on conversion reactions, for enhanced energy density and cost efficiency. However, increasing cathode loading in electrodes can cause performance depreciation, which can be alleviated by a compatible electrolyte design. In this work, a data-driven approach based on a graph-based deep learning model is adopted to screen high-performing electrolytes for a multi-electron redox-mediated Li-ICl battery and extract design rules custom to different cathode loadings. The model is trained with an experimental dataset of electrolyte formulations and battery capacity, with the inclusion of additional cell-level variables like cathode loadings. The approach brings about an additional 20% increment in the specific capacity of the battery over capacities obtained from the experimental optimization. The study resulted in an electrolyte with a high specific capacity of 250 mAh/g (at 1 mA/cm2) and excellent rate capability at the targeted 45 wt % cathode loading.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

abstract = {Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with a high burden in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. Conventional treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy, are often limited by patient factors such as multifocal disease, poor pulmonary reserve, or central airway obstruction. This review explores bronchoscopic intratumoral injection as a novel, localized therapeutic strategy and assesses its feasibility in resource-limited settings. We conducted a narrative synthesis of recent literature on bronchoscopic intratumoral injection techniques, therapeutic agents, clinical outcomes, and implementation challenges. Additional focus was placed on the Indonesian healthcare context, particularly the infrastructure in West Sumatra. Bronchoscopic intratumoral injection delivers chemotherapeutic, immunologic, or gene-based agents directly into tumors using flexible bronchoscopy, including transbronchial needle injection, endobronchial ultrasound-guided injection, and cone-beam computed tomography. This approach achieves high local drug concentrations with minimal systemic toxicity, shifting the paradigm toward immune modulation and durable tumor control. Clinical outcomes include improved airway patency, lung function, symptom relief, and survival in patients ineligible for standard therapies. Feasibility in Indonesia is supported by existing clinical resources and agent availability. Despite challenges, such as limited access to advanced imaging, specialized equipment, and skilled personnel, bronchoscopic intratumoral injection may represent a promising investigational strategy in selected cases. Further research is warranted before routine clinical implementation can be contemplated. Strategies such as structured training and regional collaboration can bridge implementation gaps, aligning innovation with equitable lung cancer care in developing countries.
Resumen
El cáncer de pulmón sigue siendo la principal causa de mortalidad relacionada con el cáncer en el mundo, con una carga muy elevada en el Sureste Asiático, en particular en Indonesia. Los tratamientos convencionales —como la cirugía, la radioterapia y la quimioterapia sistémica— suelen verse limitados por factores asociados al paciente, como la enfermedad multifocal, la escasa reserva pulmonar o la obstrucción de las vías respiratorias centrales. En esta revisión se analiza la inyección intratumoral broncoscópica como una estrategia novedosa de tratamiento localizado y se evalúa su viabilidad en los entornos con recursos limitados. Se llevó a cabo una síntesis narrativa de la bibliografía reciente sobre las técnicas de inyección intratumoral broncoscópica, los fármacos, los resultados clínicos y las dificultades de aplicación. Se prestó especial atención al contexto sanitario indonesio, sobre todo a las infraestructuras de Sumatra Occidental. Con las inyecciones intratumorales broncoscópicas se administran antineoplásicos, inmunomoduladores o genofármacos directamente en los tumores mediante técnicas de broncoscopia flexible, como la inyección transbronquial con aguja, la inyección guiada por ecografía endobronquial y el TAC de haz cónico. De esta forma se consiguen concentraciones locales elevadas del fármaco con una toxicidad sistémica mínima, lo que supone un cambio de paradigma y permite la modulación inmunitaria y el control duradero del tumor. Los principales resultados clínicos son el aumento de la permeabilidad de las vías respiratorias, la mejora de la función pulmonar, el alivio de los síntomas y la supervivencia de pacientes que no cumplen los criterios para recibir los tratamientos habituales. La viabilidad de esta técnica en Indonesia se justifica por los recursos clínicos existentes y la disponibilidad de medicamentos. Pese a las dificultades, como el acceso limitado a las técnicas avanzadas de imagen, a los equipos especializados y al personal cualificado, la inyección intratumoral broncoscópica puede ser una estrategia experimental prometedora para casos seleccionados. Antes de proceder a su aplicación clínica sistemática es necesario realizar más estudios. Las dificultades de aplicación pueden mitigarse adoptando estrategias como la formación estructurada y la colaboración regional, para que la innovación redunde en un tratamiento del cáncer de pulmón más equitativo en los países en desarrollo.}

However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art stable diffusion model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments. To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images. This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning workflows and public engagement.}

abstract = {Extensive applications have been found for rapid downscaling on meteorological wind field data in extreme weather warning, renewable energy assessment and site selection optimization, as well as dynamic simulation of nuclear accident emergency responses. This study proposes a progressive deep learning downscaling model (from 0.25° to 3 km) for generating high-resolution wind field data by integrating diffusion models with multi-head cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, a progressive diffusion framework is developed to generate high-resolution wind fields through iterative denoising of latent states initialized from Gaussian noise distributions. Compared to Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) architecture, our approach achieved approximately 32 % reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 46 % reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE), while Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) was significantly improved from 0.7 to over 0.8. It is deduced that this approach significantly improves generation quality and alleviates non-physical artifacts caused by the mode collapse within Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The integration of multi-head cross-attention mechanisms and 2D Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) enables effective fusion of cross-modal information from low-resolution wind fields, terrain data, and diffusion model latent states. Ablation studies demonstrate that the attention mechanism reduced both MAE and MSE by approximately 20 %, while improving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and SSIM values. This indicates that the attention mechanisms enable the model to capture long-range spatial dependencies, significantly enhancing its representational capacity and physical consistency in spatial feature reconstruction. Additionally, to address the slow reasoning speed of traditional diffusion models, this work implements the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling algorithm to achieve deterministic latent space mapping, substantially reducing inference steps while maintaining generation accuracy. This framework ultimately realizes rapid generation of high-precision wind field data within seconds. The proposed methodology provides a novel solution for meteorological wind field downscaling, directly serving various engineering applications requiring refined meteorological data.}

abstract = {Introduction
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital modality for investigating brain related disorders. However, data scarcity especially for novel molecular targets like neuroepigenetic enzymes combined with difficult-to-recruit patient populations limits the development of machine learning (ML) models. Our primary objective is to enhance single-subject classification of neuromolecular imaging data and facilitate biomarker discovery. We demonstrate our approach using histone deacetylase (HDAC) PET/MR imaging in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).
Methods
We propose Catalysis Training pipeline, a framework that augments real imaging data with high-quality synthetic data generated by a Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN). Using [11C]Martinostat PET/MR imaging, we extracted 1-D standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) tabular features representing HDAC enzyme expression density across eight cingulate subregions. These were used to train and test ML classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Random Forest, under leave-one-out cross-validation.
Results
Integrating synthetic data in the training process improved classification accuracy significantly: +26% for XGBoost and Random Forest (from 59% to 85%), and +18% for SVM (from 70% to 88%). Synthetic samples improved model generalizability. Key hemispheric and subregional cingulate HDAC patterns were also identified as potential biomarkers.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that generative AI can help overcome data scarcity in low-data regime neuroimaging applications. Catalysis Training provides a scalable strategy to enhance ML-driven biomarker discovery and disease classification, especially for rare or difficult-to-study disorders like AUD. Clinically, cingulate HDAC expression measured by [11C]Martinostat PET/MR shows promise as an objective biomarker for AUD, complementing DSM-based diagnosis and informing novel treatment strategies.}

Circulating levels of N-terminal brain natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-sensitive troponin T, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2, procalcitonin were measured. Predictors of AKI were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results
We found that the presence of atrial fibrillation, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥16.5 mg/g Cr, serum levels of adropin<2.1 ng/mL and NT-proBNP ≥19,540 pmol/mL were independent predictors for AKI in patients with ADHF. UACR and atrial fibrillation revealed a strict similarity in prediction of AKI, whereas discriminative ability of adropin<2.1 ng/mL were higher to NT-proBNP ≥19,540 pmol/mL. The combined predictive model (low levels of adropin + higher levels of NT-proBNP) showed significantly better discriminatory power compared to other models.
Conclusion
Low levels of adropin<2.1 ng/mL on hospital admission in patients with ADHF can predict AKI and that its predictive ability was significantly higher compared with the conventionally used urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and NT-proBNP. Adropin may add predictive information to NT-proBNP for AKI in individuals with ADHF.}

abstract = {Background
Despite research linking chemical and physical restraints to negative outcomes including unplanned intubations and psychological distress, there is little guidance for their use in the care of trauma patients. We used institutional data to describe recent trends in chemical and physical restraint in the emergency department evaluation and treatment of trauma patients and to identify characteristics associated with their use.
Methods
This study includes adult trauma activations at a United States urban level I trauma center from January 2016 to July 2022. Data were collected from the trauma registry and medical record. We assessed the use of chemical restraints and physical restraints during care provided in the trauma resuscitation bay and emergency department. We assessed trends over time graphically and with logistic regression. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations between restraint use and patient and clinical characteristics and the outcomes of ICU admission, hospitalization duration, and mortality.
Results
Of the 8,112 patients, most were male (74.8 %), White (55.8 %), and privately insured (35.2 %). Overall, 8.1 % were restrained with 7.1 % chemically restrained and 2.7 % physically restrained. Overall restraint use increased 254 % (p < 0.001) from 2016 to 2022 driven primarily by a 460 % (p < 0.001) increase in chemical restraint use including a 630 % increase in ketamine administrations (p < 0.001). Use of restraints was associated with pre-existing psychotic disorders, intoxication, altered mental status, increasing injury severity, and Medicaid insurance (p < 0.001). Chemical restraint administration was associated with a 3.5 percentage point (95 %CI 1.1–5.9; p = 0.004) increase in the probability of ICU admission and a 1.0 day (95 %CI 0.6–1.4; p < 0.001) increase in hospitalization duration.
Conclusions
In this institutional study, nearly one-in-twelve trauma patients were restrained during emergency department evaluation and treatment. Restraint utilization increased during the study driven primarily by increases in ketamine and restraints utilized during trauma bay evaluation and resuscitation. Future research should assess the generalizability of these findings. It is important that rigorous guidelines are established to ensure the safe and effective use of restraints in trauma.}

Integral to the macrophage stress response is the recognition of hypoxia and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are often coupled. The age-specific, cell-intrinsic nature of this stress response remains vague. To uncover age-defined divergences in macrophage crosstalk potential after exposure to hypoxia and PAMPs, we interrogated the secreted proteomes of neonatal versus adult macrophages via non-biased mass spectrometry. Through this approach, we newly identified age-specific signatures in the secretomes of neonatal versus adult macrophages in response to hypoxia and the prototypical PAMP, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neonatal macrophages secreted proteins most consistent with an anti-inflammatory, regenerative phenotype protective against apoptosis and oxidative stress, dependent on hypoxia inducible transcription factor-1α (HIF-1α). In contrast, adult macrophages secreted proteins consistent with a pro-inflammatory, glycolytic phenotypic signature consistent with pathogen killing. Taken together, these data uncover fundamental age and HIF-1α dependent macrophage responses that may be targeted to calibrate the innate immune response during stress and inflammation.}

However, there is a scarcity of understanding of nighttime safety despite the fast-growing body of urban scene auditing research based on daytime street view imagery (SVI). To fill the gap, this study collected ∼1000 pairwise day-and-night SVIs to train a day-to-night (D2N) SVI generator to effectively predict nighttime SVI based on daytime counterpart using generative adversarial network (GAN). The accuracy of fake nighttime image was evaluated with commonly-used GAN metrics (e.g., structural similarity index, inception score) and human validation. Then, an online visual survey with 46 participants was conducted to collect their perceived safety on street scenes during daytime and nighttime (D&N), and the results become training labels for machine learning models to predict D&N safety perceptions. Our results revealed significant discrepancies in D&N safety perception. First, through correlation analysis, we found that the sky and building features matter to the prediction accuracy of generated nighttime SVIs. Second, the micro-level streetscape features (e.g., pavements, roads, and buildings) play influential roles in perceived safety. Third, higher safety perceptions are consistently found in areas with higher building density regardless of whether they are daytime or night. In contrast, untended trees and grass reduce perceived safety at night. This study provides a valuable reference for improving the accuracy of generating nighttime images from daytime SVIs. It also reveals how streetscapes affect D&N safety perceptions in high-density cities like Hong Kong, providing empirical evidence for urban design policies to facilitate nighttime attractiveness and prosperity.}

abstract = {Lattice structures are known for their lightweight nature, excellent energy absorption, and superior thermal and acoustic insulation properties, making them ideal for applications in safety, aerospace, heat dissipation systems, and biomedical devices. With the advent of additive manufacturing, particularly laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB), the fabrication of complex lattice geometries with high precision has become feasible, which requires further investigation of their surface characteristics, microstructural behaviour, mechanical characteristics under different loading conditions, and biocompatibility. Therefore, this study was conducted to comprehensively analyze the surface integrity, mechanical responses, and biocompatibility of six distinct cellular architectures based on strut-based and sheet-based triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) topologies. The structures were designed using 3D Xpert software and manufactured using biomedical grade 316 L stainless steel (316 L SS) powder through the PBF-LB process. The dimensional analysis and surface roughness values indicated that the sheet-based structure demonstrated the closest alignment with its designed value. The XRD patterns and microstructural analysis have presented a marginal difference in the peak intensity and grain morphologies of the strut-based and sheet-based structures. Key mechanical properties, including compressive and tensile strength, high-cycle fatigue, and deformation behaviour, were systematically evaluated to compare the performance of these cellular designs. Relative density emerged as a crucial factor influencing the lattices' mechanical properties. In tensile testing, TPMS architectures outperformed strut-based counterparts in both strength and ductility. Among the strut-based lattices, the dodecahedron structure exhibited the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at 83.92 MPa, while the split-p lattice from the TPMS category achieved a UTS of 307.34 MPa. The dodecahedron and split-p lattices also demonstrated exceptional resistance to both tensile and compressive loads, making them promising candidates for further study. Furthermore, the high-cycle fatigue tests revealed that the split-p lattice significantly outlasted the dodecahedron structure, enduring 317,010 cycles before failure at 0.2 σy and 48,730 cycles at 0.8 σy. Finally, the cell viability assessment showed that the dodecahedron lattice demonstrated the highest viability in the strut-based group, while the gyroid structure led among the sheet-based configurations. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the mechanical performance of strut and TPMS cellular architectures, highlighting their potential for optimization in biomedical applications where strength, durability, and weight reduction are critical.}

The HBsAg is generally present in the bloodstream of individuals with acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. It is classically known as the HBV infection marker, and is therefore the first marker to be investigated in the laboratory in the clinical hypothesis of infection by this agent. One of the factors that compromises the HBsAg detection in the bloodstream by the assays adopted in serological screening in both clinical contexts is the loss of S protein antigenicity. This can occur due to mutations that emerge in the HBV genome regions that encode the S protein, especially for its immunodominant region – the ‘a’ determinant. These mutations can induce exchanges of amino acid residues in the S protein's primary structure, altering its tertiary structure and the antigenic conformation, which may not be recognized by anti-HBs antibodies, compromising the infection diagnosis. In addition, these exchanges can render ineffective the anti-HBs antibodies action acquired by vaccination, compromise the effectiveness of the chronically HBV infected patient's treatment, and also the HBsAg immunogenicity, by promoting its retention within the cell. In this review, the residues exchange that alter the S protein's structure is revisited, as well as the mechanisms that lead to the HBsAg antigenicity loss, and the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological consequences of this phenomenon.}

Rare diseases (RDs) are conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 people, with over 7,000 identified, primarily genetic in nature, and more than half impacting children. Although each RD affects a small population, collectively, between 3.5% and 5.9% of the global population, or 262.9–446.2 million people, live with an RD. Most RDs lack established treatment protocols, highlighting the need for proper care pathways addressing prognosis, diagnosis, and management. Advances in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to document the temporal progression of phenotypic features, addressing gaps in current knowledge bases. This study proposes an LLM-based framework to capture the natural history of diseases, specifically focusing on Noonan syndrome. The framework aims to document phenotypic trajectories, validate against RD knowledge bases, and integrate insights into care coordination using electronic health record (EHR) data from the Undiagnosed Diseases Program Singapore.}

Methods: Retrospective cohort study in adult patients with 1 emergency department visit or hospitalization with an HF diagnosis in a university hospital in 2018. One-year clinical outcomes, resources, and costs were compared with the Clinical Outcomes, Health care Resource Utilization, and Related Costs (COHERENT) model according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60, 30 to 59, 15 to 29, and < 15 (including patients on dialysis) mL/min/1.73 m². Results: Of 3274 patients with HF (median age, 84 years; 56% women), 1453 (44.4%) had eGFR ≥ 60. Lower eGFR levels were associated with higher 1-year mortality (20.4% in eGFR ≥ 60 vs 45.4% in eGFR 15 to 29; P < .001 for trend), rehospitalization, and new emergency department visits. Patients with eGFR < 15 had the highest readmission rate (50.8%; P < .001 for trend). Days out of hospital without dialysis decreased from 292 (80.0%) in eGFR ≥ 60 to 184 (50.3%) in eGFR < 15. Median cost per patient journey increased from 3960 (Q1-Q3, euro1750 to euro8410) with eGFR ≥ 60 to euro9590 (Q1-Q3, euro4140 to euro28 520; P < .001) with eGFR < 15, driven mainly by hospitalizations (84%-90% of total, except for eGFR < 15, 59.0%). Conclusions: Renal dysfunction severity was associated with progressively worse clinical outcomes, increased health resource utilization, and higher costs in patients with HF. Strategies are needed to improve outcomes and reduce costs in patients with HF and severe chronic kidney disease.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos: La enfermedad renal crónica es frecuente en pacientes con insuficiencia cardiaca (IC), complica su tratamiento y empeora el pronóstico. Este estudio evaluó el impacto de diferentes grados de disfunción renal, incluida la diálisis, en los resultados clínicos, el uso de recursos y los costes en pacientes con IC. Métodos: Estudio retrospectivo en pacientes con diagnóstico de IC en urgencias o ingreso en un hospital terciario durante 2018. Se compararon resultados clínicos, recursos y costes a 1 año según la tasa de filtración glomerular estimada (TFGe) ≥ 60, 30-59, 15-29 y < 15 ml/min/1,73 m2 (incluida diálisis), con el modelo Clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilization and related costs (COHERENT). Resultados: De 3.274 pacientes con IC (mediana de 84 años; el 56% mujeres), 1.453 (44,4%) tenían TFGe ≥ 60. TFGe menores se asociaron a mayor mortalidad (el 20,4% en TFGe ≥ 60 y el 45,4% en TFGe 15-29; p de tendencia < 0,001), más rehospitalizaciones y nuevas visitas a urgencias. Los pacientes con TFGe < 15 presentaron la mayor tasa de reingresos (50,8%; p de tendencia < 0,001). Los días vivos fuera del hospital sin diálisis disminuyeron de 292 (80,0%) en TFGe ≥ 60 a 184 (50,3%) en TFGe < 15. El coste mediano por paciente aumentó de 3.960 euro (Q1-Q3, 1.750-8.410 euro) con TFGe ≥ 60 a 9.590 euro (Q1-Q3, 4.140-28.520 euro, p < 0,001) con TFGe < 15, impulsado principalmente por la hospitalización (el 84-90% del total, excepto en la TFGe < 15, que fue del 59,0%). Conclusiones: La enfermedad renal crónica grave en pacientes con IC se asocia con peores resultados clínicos, mayor uso de recursos y costes mucho más altos. Se necesitan nuevas estrategias para mejorar resultados, y reducir costes en pacientes con IC y enfermedad renal crónica grave.}

abstract = {Drilling fluids are complex suspensions of particles with a wide diameter range. While extensive research has explored the rheological behavior of drilling fluids, several limitations still exist. High-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions encountered in drilling fluids have introduced unique challenges, and only a few studies have attempted to develop a comprehensive equation that addresses both aspects concurrently. This study aims to perform a rheological characterization of a water-based drilling fluid (WBDF) containing xanthan gum under HPHT conditions and propose a constitutive equation to fit rheological data in such conditions. The experiments were conducted using an Anton Paar MCR 702TD rotational rheometer, coupled with a pressure cell. Steady-state flow curves were obtained at three different temperatures (25, 55, and 100 °C) and pressures ranging from 100 to 800 bar. The experimental data were fitted to the power-law model, and the rheological parameters of the model were fitted with variations in temperature and pressure. The fluid exhibited shear-thinning behavior, with the influence of temperature being more predominant than the effect of pressure, however, both variables have a strong relationship. Furthermore, we proposed a methodology to establish an equation capable of predicting the shear stress of the drilling fluid under HPHT conditions. The equation was also compared with different drilling fluids tested on different rheometers. This equation demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy within the fitted range. The insights provided in this study hold substantial implications for the oil and gas industry, as predicting the rheological behavior of drilling fluids under varying temperatures and pressures within the annular region of the well is essential for efficient drilling planning, particularly in offshore fields.}

Sensors are the key elements to generate real world data and to feed trustworthy data into digital models or digital twins. A large variety of applications require a consistent digital metrology domain. It is a complex and challenging task, especially for modern internet of things (IOT) based factory environments with numerous sensors distributed. A stringent chain of traceable calibration information is essential when calibrating sensors and providing calibration data in a machine readable and machine interpretable way for a trusted digital quality infrastructure. The GEMIMEG-II project used and qualified the Digital Calibration Certificate (DCC) for industrial applications. It introduced quality indicators (QoX) with information on the trust level of the respective data. Finally, a DCC sub-model for the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and Digital Product Passport (DPP) was prepared. A future perspective concludes this paper.}

We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SM-Seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and targeted qPCR to compare microbial and ARG diversity in the influent to a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Australia. ARGs were annotated with CARD-RGI and MEGARes databases, and bacterial diversity was characterised by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SM-Seq, with species annotation in SILVA/GreenGenes databases or Kraken2 and the NCBI nucleotide database respectively. CARD and MEGARes identified evenly distributed ARG profiles but MEGARes detected a richer array of ARGs (richness = 475 vs 320). Qualitatively, ARGs encoding for aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and multidrug resistance were the most abundant in all examined databases. RNA-seq detected only 32 % of ARGs identified by SM-Seq, but there was concordance in the qualitative identification of aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide, phenicol, sulfonamide and multidrug resistance by SM-Seq and RNA-seq. qPCR confirmed the detection of some ARGs, including OXA, VEB and EREB, that were identified by SM-Seq and RNA-seq in the influent. For bacteria, SM-Seq or 16S rRNA gene sequencing were equally effective in population profiling at phyla or class level. However, SM-Seq identified a significantly higher species richness (richness = 15,000 vs 3750). These results demonstrate that SM-Seq with gene annotation in CARD and MEGARes are equally sufficient for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in wastewater. For more precise ARG identification and quantification however, MEGARes presented a better resolution. The functionality of detected ARGs was not confirmed, but general agreement on the putative phenotypic resistance profile by antimicrobial class was observed between RNA-Seq and SM-Seq.}

abstract = {HIV-1 can rapidly infect the brain upon initial infection, establishing latent reservoirs that induce neuronal damage and/or death, resulting in HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder. Though anti-HIV-1 antiretrovirals (ARVs) suppress viral load, the blood-brain barrier limits drug access to the brain, largely because of highly expressed efflux proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gp). While no FDA-approved P-gp inhibitor currently exists, HIV-1 protease inhibitors show promise as partial P-gp inhibitors, potentially enhancing drug delivery to the brain. Herein, we employed docking and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate key differences in P-gp’s interactions with several antiretrovirals, including protease inhibitors, with known inhibitory or substrate-like behaviors towards P-gp. Our results led us to hypothesize new mechanistic details of small-molecule efflux by and inhibition of P-gp, where the “Lower Pocket” in P-gp’s transmembrane domain serves as the primary initial site for small-molecule binding. Subsequently, this pocket merges with the more traditionally studied drug binding site—the “Upper Pocket”—thus funneling small-molecule drugs, such as ARVs, towards the Upper Pocket for efflux. Furthermore, our results reinforce the understanding that both binding energetics and changes in protein dynamics are crucial in discerning small molecules as non-substrates, substrates, or inhibitors of P-gp. Our findings indicate that interactions between P-gp and inhibitory ARVs induce bridging of transmembrane domain helices, impeding P-gp conformational changes and contributing to the inhibitory behavior of these ARVs. Overall, insights gained in this study could serve to guide the design of future P-gp-targeting therapeutics for a wide range of pathological conditions and diseases, including HIV-1.}

This research aims to contribute to this knowledge by assessing the effect of temperature and water availability along the growing cycle on grape quality and in particular on the phenolic compounds and their extractability. The research was carried out in a commercial vineyard in La Mancha Designation of Origen (Spain) planted with Merlot. Edaphoclimatic characteristics and the grape composition at maturity were evaluated for several years in the period 2007–2017. An increase in temperature decreased the content of phenolic compounds, while higher water availability contributed to increase their levels in the grapes. Total anthocyanin content was mainly affected by minimum temperature before veraison while extractable anthocyanin, flavonols and total polyphenols were affected by both maximum and minimum temperature during ripening. Higher water availability decreased the concentration of anthocyanins but favoured their extractability, while flavonols were not significantly affected by water availability. Thus, phenolic ripening can be affected by changes in temperature and water distribution throughout the growing cycle, but due to the opposite sign of their effect they may be partially balanced. The projected warmer conditions can affect phenolic composition of Merlot and therefore quality of the wines made with such variety. In order to maintain grape quality, strategies to reduce heat stress should be adopted, and irrigation doses and timing should be adapted not only in the ripening period but also in the period prior to veraison.}

Other theorists defend an ‘early-onset’ account, suggesting that consciousness is likely to be in place at birth (or shortly after) and may even arise during the third trimester. Progress in this field has been difficult, not just because of the challenges associated with procuring the relevant behavioral and neural data, but also because of uncertainty about how best to study consciousness in the absence of the capacity for verbal report or intentional behavior. This review examines both the empirical and methodological progress in this field, arguing that recent research points in favor of early-onset accounts of the emergence of consciousness.}

Practical industrial process data are mostly nonlinear, dynamical, and manifested as temporal correlation, which makes it challenging for traditional monitoring methods to accurately capture the changes in internal state variables. To this end, a multi-block whitening slow feature analysis (MBW-SFA) approach is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the cross maximum information coefficient (CMIC) for nonlinear correlation analysis, blocking, as well as selective whitening transformation (SWT) for the nonlinear and strongly coupled process variables, so as to avoid the information loss caused by global whitening. The proposed MBW-SFA approach performs manifold mapping on the data with strong correlations, preserving key information while reducing dimensionality, and the selective whitening transformation is applied to prevent information loss across different variables. In addition, for scenarios involving partially known fault data, this study proposes a control limit optimization (CLO) function that balances fault identification and false alarms to calculate control limit thresholds based on slow feature monitoring statistics, achieving objective monitoring of industrial processes. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on Tennessee Eastman process, where the correlation between process variables is investigated, and the results show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in process monitoring.}

In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.}

Cataract surgeries are among the most performed surgeries worldwide. A thorough patient education is essential to inform patients about the perioperative process and postoperative target results concerning the intraocular lens and objectives for visual outcomes. However, addressing all relevant aspects and questions is time-consuming. Mobile apps can facilitate this process for both patients and physicians and thus be beneficial. However, the success of such an app depends on its user friendliness and acceptance by patients.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the user friendliness and acceptance of a cataract surgery education app on mobile devices among patients undergoing cataract surgery, the characteristics of patients who benefit the most from app use, and the influence of the app on patient satisfaction with treatment.
Methods
All patients who underwent cataract surgery at an ophthalmological practice from August 2020 to July 2021 were invited to participate in this randomized controlled trial. Out of 493 invited patients, 297 (60.2%) were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized into 3 different groups. Half of the patients were offered to participate in Group 1 with use of the “Patient Journey” app. However, if they decided not to use the app, they were included in Group 2 (app denial). The other half of the patients were included in Group 3 (control) with no use of the app and with information provided conventionally. The app provided general information on the ophthalmological center, surgeons, cataract, and treatment options. Different questionnaires were used in all 3 groups to evaluate satisfaction with the perioperative process. Group 1 evaluated the app. Demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and educational degree, were assessed.
Results
Group 1 included 77 patients (median age 69 years). Group 2 included 61 patients, and their median age was higher (median age 79 years). Group 3 included 159 patients (median age 74 years). There was no difference in satisfaction with the perioperative process and clinic between the 3 groups. Almost all app users appreciated the digital details provided for the organization and the information on the surgery. Age did not play a major role in appreciation of the app. Female patients tended to appreciate the information provided more than male patients. Patients who did not have a higher university degree experienced more benefits from the informational content of the app and were the most satisfied with the information. However, male patients and academics were in general more aware of technology and handled the app more easily.
Conclusions
The app showed high user friendliness and acceptance, and could particularly benefit specific patient groups. App users demonstrated a noninferior high satisfaction with the treatment in the ophthalmological center in comparison with patients who were informed about the surgery only conventionally.}

Therefore, our ultimate aim is to synthesize physiologically accurate EEG data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this preliminary study, we first investigate how the choice of GAN hyperparameters influences the quality of simpler EEG-like generated signals. Thereto, we first created sinusoidal samples as target datasets with single (12 Hz), double (5, 12 Hz), or triple frequencies (5, 12, 28 Hz) and added Gaussian noise. We trained 2,592 models to generate fake sinusoidal samples and examined the effects of varying the hyperparameters batch size, learning rate of generator (LrG) and discriminator (LrD), and the number of epochs for vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and WGAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). We compared the distributions of relevant target and fake signal features, such as amplitude, phase, and signal-to-noise ratio, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Our results showed that WGAN-GP models had better training stability for sinusoidal sample generation compared to WGAN, and significantly outperformed vanilla GAN. Smaller batch sizes accelerated convergence at a fixed number of epochs. Matching LrG and LrD balanced networks during training. Increasing the number of epochs (up to 100) enhanced performance. We conclude that the WGAN-GP model provides the best quality signals, when hyperparameters, particularly learning rate, are well tuned. We therefore propose that effective combinations of hyperparameters enhance training stability and performance of GANs for EEG signal generation.}

To overcome the problems of manually setting the value range of control parameters and numerical oscillation of the optimization results (i.e. low stability), a hybrid optimization approach is proposed for the improvement of hobbing performances under user evaluation using K-means clustering, multi-objective hunger games search (MOHGS) and TOPSIS. Firstly, K-means clustering is applied to obtain the cluster centers and case clusters based on the historical cutting cases. Considering the problem of control parameters to be optimized, the numerical range of control parameters is determined via the cluster centers and case clusters. Then, MOHGS is developed and applied to search the non-inferior control parameters and run for many times based on the multi-target optimization model of dry hobbing. Finally, all the non-inferior control parameters obtained are ranked by TOPSIS method based on the user evaluation of cutting performances, and the control parameter ranking first is for machining. Compared with other well-known approaches, it is proved that the proposed approach can effectively resolve the control parameter optimization problem of dry hobbing under user evaluation and has high stability.}

abstract = {Benzophenone (BP) scaffold, owing to its highly applicable photo-related properties, has been widespread among many branches of chemical research and industry. While the benzophenone molecule itself has been extensively studied towards the intrinsic mechanisms standing behind its prominent nature, yet its derivatives still tend to be under-explored in this particular regard. Coming across the disclosed imparity, throughout the present paper, a subject of rotational isomerism, anticipated to affect the BP frameworks substituted in the ortho position, is thoroughly investigated. In this respect, a bunch of ortho derivatives of BP are subjected to a systematic analysis carried out via both in silico DFT modeling and spectroscopic measurements (IR, UV–Vis). The obtained results show that the effect of rotamerism indeed applies to the studied group of compounds, as some of them reveal themselves in the form of multiple coexisting conformational isomers. What is more, as the indicated conformers are found to be characterized by substantially different emission profiles, the foregoing phenomenon is disclosed to have quite a remarkable impact onto the photoluminescence of the explored o-BP molecules.}
