abstract = {Fault diagnosis and detection (FDD) improves product quality, process safety, and profitability in modern industrial plants. Faults can propagate between different parts of plants due to connections between devices and control loops. As a result, control room operators may receive multiple alarms that distract their attention from addressing the main causes of abnormal situations. Therefore, investigating causal relationships between process variables is essential in determining the root cause of faults. This study proposes a new systematic approach for causality analysis to identify the propagation path and root cause of faults in industrial plants. The research's innovations are categorized into two main parts. Initially, the study utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify causal relationships using probabilistic concepts. Additionally, it introduces a novel architecture by merging the generative adversarial network (GAN) with the variational auto-encoder (VAE). The process variables are mapped to a latent space, where an adversarial generative network will investigate the causal relationship between variables. Finally, the Tennessee Eastman Process simulation and gas turbine industrial data are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm.}

This study aims to investigate the ability of ChatGPT to generate reliably accurate responses to patient-based queries specifically regarding oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) of the head and neck.
Study design
Retrospective review of published abstracts.
Setting
Publicly available generative artificial intelligence.
Methods
ChatGPT 3.5 (May 2024) was queried with a set of 30 questions pertaining to HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer that the average patient may ask. This set of questions was queried a total of four times preceded by a different prompt. The answer prompts for each question set were reviewed and graded on a four-part Likert scale. A Flesch-Kincaid reading level was also calculated for each prompt.
Results
For all answer prompts (n = 120), 6.6 % were graded as mostly inaccurate, 7.5 % were graded as minorly inaccurate, 41.7 % were graded as accurate, and 44.2 % were graded as accurate and helpful. The average Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level was lowest for the responses without any prompt (11.77). Understandably, the highest grade levels were found in the physician-friend prompt (12.97). Of the 30 references, 25 (83.3 %) were found to be authentic published studies. Of the 25 authentic references, the answers accurately cited information found within the original source for 14 of the references (56 %).
Conclusion
ChatGPT was able to produce relatively accurate responses to example patient questions, but there was a high rate of false references. In addition, the reading level of the answer prompts was well above the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for the average patient.}

However, few survey has discussed such a potential. To fill this gap, we have collected over 200 papers since the publication of original NeRF in 2020 and present a thorough analysis of how NeRF can be used to enhance the capabilities of autonomous robots. We especially focus on the perception, localization and navigation, and decision-making modules of autonomous robots and delve into tasks crucial for autonomous operation, including 3-dimensional reconstruction, segmentation, pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping, navigation and planning, and interaction. Our survey meticulously benchmarks existing NeRF-based methods, comparing their reported performance, and providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we target the existing challenges of applying NeRF in autonomous robots, including real-time processing, sparse input views, and explore promising avenues for future research and development in this domain. We especially discuss potential of integrating advanced deep learning techniques like 3-dimensional Gaussian splatting, large language models, and generative artificial intelligence. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to leverage NeRF to empower autonomous robots, paving the way for innovative solutions that can navigate and interact seamlessly in complex environments.}

But, for this to happen, we demonstrate the need to create valuable prompts that result in specific, helpful, and actionable HRM recommendations. Accordingly, we provide eight guidelines for creating high-quality and effective prompts and illustrate their usefulness in general across eight critical HRM domains and in more depth in the particular areas of workforce diversity and strategic HRM. We also provide recommendations and demonstrate how to implement a critical verification process to check on ChatGPT’s suggestions. We conclude with a list of “dos and don’ts” and that when used by sufficiently trained HRM professionals, it is a very useful tool because it helps complete tasks faster, hopefully reducing their job burnout and allowing them to allocate more time to strategic and long-term issues.

Besides providing this technology through an easily accessible web application, this article evaluates the technology’s performance by comparing the quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) from Generative AI models with human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions to marketing analytics exercises. The results show that automated feedback produced by Generative AI (GPT-4) provides almost unbiased evaluations while correlating highly with (r = 0.94) and deviating only 6 % from human evaluations. GPT-4 performs best among seven Generative AI models, albeit at the highest cost. Comparing the models’ performance with costs shows that GPT-4, Mistral Large, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.0 Pro dominate three other Generative AI models (Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.5 Pro). Expert assessment of the qualitative feedback (i.e., the AI’s textual response) indicates that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners. A survey of marketing analytics learners shows that they highly recommend the app and its Generative AI feedback. An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticism—it does not require any subject- or exercise-specific training.

We undertook a cross-sectional comparative study, which was analyzed using PLS-SEM and fsQCA. Where PLS-SEM provided limited inferential insights about the differences between anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic chatbots, the FsQCA analysis resulted in three configurations of attributes for non-anthropomorphic and two configurations for anthropomorphic chatbots, which lead to higher cognitive absorption.

This study investigates the potential of generative AI, specifically GPT-4, in classifying course learning outcomes according to their respective cognitive levels within the revised Bloom's taxonomy. To assess the effectiveness of GenAI, we conducted a comparative study using a dataset of 1000 annotated learning outcomes. We tested multiple prompt engineering strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, rhetorical situation, and multiple binary questions, leveraging GPT-4. Classification performance was evaluated using accuracy, Cohen's κ, and F1-score. The results indicate that the prompt incorporating rhetorical context and domain-specific knowledge achieved the highest classification performance, while the multiple binary question approach underperformed even compared to the zero-shot method. Furthermore, we compared the best-performing prompting strategy with a state-of-the-art classification model, BERT. Although the fine-tuned BERT model showed superior performance, prompt-based classification exhibited moderate to substantial agreement with expert annotations. Overall, this article demonstrates the potential of leveraging large language models to advance both theoretical understanding and practical application within the field of education and natural language processing.}

The overlapping characteristics of oral lichen planus (OLP), a chronic oral mucosal inflammatory condition, with those of other oral lesions, present diagnostic challenges. Large language models (LLMs) with integrated computer-vision capabilities and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) constitute an alternative diagnostic modality. We evaluated the ability of seven LLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, to detect OLP from intraoral images and generate differential diagnoses.
Methods
Using a dataset with 1,142 clinical photographs of histopathologically confirmed OLP, non-OLP lesions, and normal mucosa. The LLMs were tested using three experimental designs: zero-shot recognition, example-guided recognition, and differential diagnosis. Performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and discounted cumulative gain (DCG). Furthermore, the performance of LLMs was compared with three previously published CNN-based models for OLP detection on a subset of 110 photographs, which were previously used to test the CNN models.
Results
Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash demonstrated the highest accuracy (69.69%) in zero-shot recognition, whereas GPT-4o ranked first in the F1 score (76.10%). With example-guided prompts, which improved consistency and reduced refusal rates, Gemini 1.5 Flash achieved the highest accuracy (80.53%) and F1-score (84.54%); however, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved the highest DCG score of 0.63. Although the proprietary models generally excelled, the open-source Llama model demonstrated notable strengths in ranking relevant diagnoses despite moderate performance in detection tasks. All LLMs were outperformed by the CNN models.
Conclusion
The seven evaluated LLMs lack sufficient performance for clinical use. CNNs trained to detect OLP outperformed the LLMs tested in this study.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to explain the privacy paradox, wherein individuals, despite privacy concerns, are willing to share personal information while using AI chatbots. Departing from previous research that primarily viewed AI chatbots from a non-anthropomorphic approach, this paper contends that AI chatbots are taking on an emotional component for humans. This study thus explores this topic by considering both rational and non-rational perspectives, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior in digital environments.
Design/methodology/approach
Employing a questionnaire survey (N = 480), this research focuses on young users who regularly engage with AI chatbots. Drawing upon the parasocial interaction theory and privacy calculus theory, the study elucidates the mechanisms governing users’ willingness to disclose information.
Findings
Findings show that cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions all positively influence perceived benefits of using ChatGPT, which in turn enhances privacy disclosure. While cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions negatively impact perceived risks, only the emotional and behavioral dimensions significantly affect perceived risk, which in turn negatively influences privacy disclosure. Notably, the cognitive dimension’s lack of significant mediating effect suggests that users’ awareness of privacy risks does not deter disclosure. Instead, emotional factors drive privacy decisions, with users more likely to disclose personal information based on positive experiences and engagement with ChatGPT. This confirms the existence of the privacy paradox.
Research limitations/implications
This study acknowledges several limitations. While the sample was adequately stratified, the focus was primarily on young users in China. Future research should explore broader demographic groups, including elderly users, to understand how different age groups engage with AI chatbots. Additionally, although the study was conducted within the Chinese context, the findings have broader applicability, highlighting the potential for cross-cultural comparisons. Differences in user attitudes toward AI chatbots may arise due to cultural variations, with East Asian cultures typically exhibiting a more positive attitude toward social AI systems compared to Western cultures. This cultural distinction—rooted in Eastern philosophies such as animism in Shintoism and Buddhism—suggests that East Asians are more likely to anthropomorphize technology, unlike their Western counterparts (Yam et al., 2023; Folk et al., 2023).
Practical implications
The findings of this study offer valuable insights for developers, policymakers and educators navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of intelligent technologies. First, regarding technology design, the study suggests that AI chatbot developers should not focus solely on functional aspects but also consider emotional and social dimensions in user interactions. By enhancing emotional connection and ensuring transparent privacy communication, developers can significantly improve user experiences (Meng and Dai, 2021). Second, there is a pressing need for comprehensive user education programs. As users tend to prioritize perceived benefits over risks, it is essential to raise awareness about privacy risks while also emphasizing the positive outcomes of responsible information sharing. This can help foster a more informed and balanced approach to user engagement (Vimalkumar et al., 2021). Third, cultural and ethical considerations must be incorporated into AI chatbot design. In collectivist societies like China, users may prioritize emotional satisfaction and societal harmony over privacy concerns (Trepte, 2017; Johnston, 2009). Developers and policymakers should account for these cultural factors when designing AI systems. Furthermore, AI systems should communicate privacy policies clearly to users, addressing potential vulnerabilities and ensuring that users are aware of the extent to which their data may be exposed (Wu et al., 2024). Lastly, as AI chatbots become deeply integrated into daily life, there is a growing need for societal discussions on privacy norms and trust in AI systems. This research prompts a reflection on the evolving relationship between technology and personal privacy, especially in societies where trust is shaped by cultural and emotional factors. Developing frameworks to ensure responsible AI practices while fostering user trust is crucial for the long-term societal integration of AI technologies (Nah et al., 2023).
Originality/value
The study’s findings not only draw deeper theoretical insights into the role of emotions in generative artificial intelligence (gAI) chatbot engagement, enriching the emotional research orientation and framework concerning chatbots, but they also contribute to the literature on human–computer interaction and technology acceptance within the framework of the privacy calculus theory, providing practical insights for developers, policymakers and educators navigating the evolving landscape of intelligent technologies.}

abstract = {A core principle of open science is the clear, concise and accessible publication of empirical data, including “raw” observational data as well as processed results. However, in empirical software engineering there are no established standards (de jure or de facto) for representing and “opening” observations collected in test-driven software experiments — that is, experiments involving the execution of software subjects in controlled scenarios. Execution data is therefore usually represented in ad hoc ways, often making it abstruse and difficult to access without significant manual effort. In this paper we present new data structures designed to address this problem by clearly defining, correlating and representing the stimuli and responses used to execute software subjects in test-driven experiments. To demonstrate their utility, we show how they can be used to promote the repetition, replication and reproduction of experimental evaluations of AI-based code completion tools. We also show how the proposed data structures facilitate the incremental expansion of execution data sets, and thus promote their repurposing for new experiments addressing new research questions.}

However, it cannot measure out-of-plane displacements, which are movements perpendicular to the image plane. To address the limitation, this study presents a novel approach for SRW displacement monitoring by using RGB-depth (RGB-D) image. The proposed method used RGB images captured from a single camera and CNN-based depth estimation models to generate a depth map. The depth map was then used for point cloud reconstruction and displacement calculation. Additionally, a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based enhancement module was implemented to enhance low-quality images captured in low-light or overexposed environments, leading to improved monitoring. The proposed approach was validated through laboratory experiments. The depth estimation models demonstrated high performance, achieving accuracies ranging from 0.896 to 0.957. The generative AI model effectively improved the accuracy of depth map prediction in low-light conditions. The calculated 3D displacement results derived from RGB-D images, with the depth component estimated by the MobileNet depth estimation model, demonstrated the highest accuracy, with errors ranging from 0.0 to 2.6 mm. The proposed method is a reliable, adaptable, and efficient solution for monitoring structural displacement, offering significant potential for real-world applications.}

abstract = {Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) Large-language models such as ChatGPT have become increasingly popular in various fields. However, the impact of ChatGPT on dental research writing has yet to be quantified. This study aimed to assess ChatGPT's usage in dental research writing and discuss potential advantages and challenges.
Methods
Using a bibliometric design, we performed a keyword analysis of specific 'signaling words' indicative of ChatGPT use in the titles/abstracts of 299,695 dental research abstracts indexed PubMed 2018–2024. Statistical comparisons using normalized ratios per 10,000 dental publications compared changes in word frequency before and after the ChatGPT release on November 30, 2022.
Results
Before ChatGPT's release, the frequency of abstracts with signaling words was 47.1 per 10,000 papers. After the release, this increased to 224.2 per 10,000 papers, an increase of 177.2 per 10,000 papers (p = 0.014, 95 % CI 53.5–300.7). The word 'delve' showed the most significant usage increase (increased ratio=17.0).
Conclusions
This study is among the first to systematically assess the use of GenAI, specifically ChatGPT, in dental research. We found evidence of the use and growth of ChatGPT in dental research publications. This trend indicates the widespread adoption of GenAI-assisted writing in scientific communication, consistent with other scientific fields. While GenAI can potentially increase productivity and inclusivity, it raises concerns such as bias, inaccuracy, and distortion of academic incentives. Therefore, our findings support the need for clear AI guidelines and standards for academic publishing to ensure responsible use and maintain scientific integrity.}

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently unvalidated in its content. This study sought to analyze AI responses to questions and recommendations from the 2018 Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) guidelines on subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus DBS for the treatment of patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
Methods
Seven questions were generated from CNS guidelines and asked to ChatGPT 4o, Perplexity, Copilot, and Gemini. Answers were “concordant” if they highlighted all points provided by the CNS guidelines; otherwise, answers were considered “non-concordant” and sub-categorized as either “insufficient” or “overconclusive.” AI responses were evaluated for readability via the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Index, and Flesch Reading Ease tests.
Results
ChatGPT 4o showcased 42.9% concordance, with non-concordant responses classified as 14.3% insufficient and 42.8% over-conclusive. Perplexity displayed a 28.6% concordance rate, with 14.3% insufficient and 57.1% over-conclusive responses. Copilot showed 28.6% concordance, with 28.6% insufficient and 42.8% over-conclusive responses. Gemini demonstrated 28.6% concordance, with 28.6% insufficient and 42.8% over-conclusive responses. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores ranged from 14.44 (Gemini) to 18.94 (Copilot), Gunning Fog Index scores varied between 17.9 (Gemini) and 22.06 (Copilot), SMOG Index scores ranged from 16.54 (Gemini) to 19.67 (Copilot), and all Flesch Reading Ease scores were low, with Gemini showing the highest score of 30.91.
Conclusion
ChatGPT 4o displayed the most concordance, Perplexity displayed the highest over-conclusive rate, and Copilot and Gemini showcased the most insufficient answers. All responses showcased complex readability. Despite the possible benefits of future developments and innovation in AI capabilities, AI requires further improvement before independent clinical usage in DBS.}

However, recent studies indicate that LMs are particularly susceptible to malicious backdoor attacks, where attackers manipulate the models to exhibit specific behaviors when they encounter particular triggers. While existing research has focused on backdoor attacks against English LMs, Chinese LMs remain largely unexplored. Moreover, existing backdoor attacks against Chinese LMs exhibit limited stealthiness. In this paper, we investigate the high detectability of current backdoor attacks against Chinese LMs and propose a more stealthy backdoor attack method based on syntactic paraphrasing. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to construct a syntactic paraphrasing mechanism that transforms benign inputs into poisoned samples with predefined syntactic structures. Subsequently, we exploit the syntactic structures of these poisoned samples as triggers to create more stealthy and robust backdoor attacks across various attack strategies. Extensive experiments conducted on three major NLP tasks with various Chinese PLMs and LLMs demonstrate that our method can achieve comparable attack performance (almost 100% success rate). Additionally, the poisoned samples generated by our method show lower perplexity and fewer grammatical errors compared to traditional character-level backdoor attacks. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong resistance against two state-of-the-art backdoor defense mechanisms.}

Most existing emotion regulation interventions aim to provide long-term or on-site assistance to help users manage their sentiments to a desired psychological state. Recent advancements have significantly bolstered online emotion regulation interventions, such as AI-driven mindfulness apps that adapt to user feedback. Online-based emotion regulation applications are considered influential on users’ contextual and emotional decision-making processes. However, existing research offers limited observations on (i) how emotion regulation interventions affect people’s opinion changes and (ii) how generative AI could contribute to the development of automatic emotion regulation interventions. Hence, we experimented with 150 participants to close this research gap. We proposed two novel emotion regulation approaches to determine whether users’ opinions and emotional changes differ between ordinary-AI-based and generative-AI-based interventions on emotion regulation tasks. The result revealed that people’s feelings and decisions are highly correlated to their information consumption and perspectives. Furthermore, we found that intervention methods and users’ perceptions of the technology behind that intervention also played a vital role in their user experiences and decision-making processes. This research (i) shows that there exist interactions between emotions and opinion changes, (ii) opens new avenues for leveraging generative AI in emotion regulation applications, and (iii) underscores how divergent attitudes towards AI technology can lead to varied levels of success in the user experience.}

Initially, natural language processing and explainable machine learning were employed to develop a predictive model for evaluating the empathy of GPT-4’s responses. Feature sensitivity analysis identified key linguistic features that significantly influence empathy performance. These insights were then integrated with empathy component theory and helping skills theory to design prompt engineering to enhance GPT-4’s emotional support capabilities. Evaluation results show that while unprompted GPT-4 demonstrates substantial empathy in addressing help-seekers’ needs, it still lags behind human counselors. However, when guided by targeted prompts, GPT-4’s emotional support capabilities improve markedly compared to its zero-prompt version. Notably, in handling emotional issues such as anger, fear, and disgust, prompted GPT-4 performs at a level comparable to human counselors. In summary, this study provides initial evidence of GPT-4’s potential in emotional support and introduces an evaluation framework (initial-Evaluation, Enhancement, and re-Evaluation; EEE) that can be used to assess and optimize LLMs' abilities in mental health applications, offering insights into their role in supporting human mental health services.}

Large language models (LLMs) have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to process data efficiently. While LLMs have emerged as useful tools for various tasks, their potential to replace human experts in assessing building energy retrofit challenges remains unexplored. This research explores the potential of replacing human experts with LLMs by evaluating four mainstream LLM chatbots and comparing their performance against a human expert benchmark through semantic similarity and text correlation metrics. It answers the research question: can LLMs replace human experts in assessing the challenges to building energy retrofits? Prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, were employed to guide LLM responses. Results show that LLMs perform well in identifying challenges but are less reliable in ranking them. CoT prompting improves challenge ranking accuracy but does not enhance challenge identification. Incorporating domain-specific knowledge in prompts significantly enhances LLM performance, whereas prompts designed to simulate experts have notable limitations in improving LLM performance. Furthermore, there are no significant performance differences among LLMs, including their advanced versions. While LLMs can streamline the initial identification of building energy retrofit challenges, they cannot fully replace expert judgment in ranking challenges due to their lack of tacit knowledge. This research provides valuable insight into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the challenge assessment, offering practical guidance for industry practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into their building energy efficiency practices.}

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have the potential to improve mental health care for practitioners and clients. Evidence demonstrates that AI chatbots can assist with tasks such as documentation, research, counseling, and therapeutic exercises. However, research examining practitioners’ perspectives is limited.
Objective
This mixed-methods study investigates: (1) practitioners’ perspectives on different uses of generative AI chatbots; (2) their likelihood of recommending chatbots to clients; and (3) whether recommendation likelihood increases after viewing a demonstration.
Methods
Participants were 23 mental health practitioners, including 17 females and 6 males, with a mean age of 39.39 (SD 16.20) years. In 45-minute interviews, participants selected their 3 most helpful uses of chatbots from 11 options and rated their likelihood of recommending chatbots to clients on a Likert scale before and after an 11-minute chatbot demonstration.
Results
Binomial tests found that Generating case notes was selected at greater-than-chance levels ( 15/23, 65%; P=.001), while Support with session planning (P=.86) and Identifying and suggesting literature (P=.10) were not. Although 55% (12/23) were likely to recommend chatbots to clients, a binomial test found no significant difference from the 50% threshold (P=.74). A paired samples t test found that recommendation likelihood increased significantly (19/23, 83%; P=.002) from predemonstration to postdemonstration.
Conclusions
Findings suggest practitioners favor administrative uses of generative AI and are more likely to recommend chatbots to clients after exposure. This study highlights a need for practitioner education and guidelines to support safe and effective AI integration in mental health care.}

However, most existing studies estimate a singular land value over large areas, lacking the fine-grained details for urban management. This study therefore develops a RAHGV (relative-to-absolute hybrid generative valuation) framework for regional land valuation, which combines a hybrid learning strategy with deep generative modeling to produce high-resolution, spatially continuous land value distribution across extensive urban areas. In a case study of New York City (NYC), the RAHGV model outperforms typical one-step models by differentiating between local land variations and broader regional tendencies. Its bi-attention bottleneck significantly improves model performance, reducing MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 45.75% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) by 69.86% compared to conventional deep generative methods. Local physical infrastructure and mixed land-use patterns primarily influence micro-scale land values, while community amenities and economic vibrancy drive macro-scale values. The findings highlight the potential of the RAHGV framework as a powerful tool for promoting sustainable urban development by delivering high-resolution, data-driven insights that support informed decision-making in rapidly evolving urban environments.}

Intelligent monitoring of workers’ unsafe behaviors can effectively prevent the expansion of safety risks, thereby blocking the development process of risks to accidents. Electric power production processes are diverse in nature and require the frequent switching of operating scenarios. This makes it difficult to identify what is “unsafe” since worker behaviors within the given electrical context also exhibit variability and diversity. Existing methods have insufficient generalization and adaptability, which makes them inadequate for the case of electric power production. Therefore, this paper proposes Safety Generative Pre-trained Transformers (SafetyGPT), an autonomous agent of safety risk based on a multi-modal large language model, which incorporates a human–machine collaborative monitoring mode for unsafe behaviors of workers. SafetyGPT loads the electric power production video, and the backend supervisors set instructions for SafetyGPT based on task requirements. The model encodes visual and textual features into corresponding tokens, realizes multi-modal feature alignment and fusion through the cross-attention mechanism, and then generates targeted responses through the large language model. Next, the proposed method is applied to real production site data to confirm the effectiveness and superiority through comparison with other methods designed to identify unsafe behaviors. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method for the identification of unsafe behaviors in complex environments is 96.5%, and that it can generate reasonable recommended plan based on the identification results, assist backend supervisors in making decisions, and effectively improve the safety level of power production.}

The cDCGAN model is applied to a case study of a generic classroom with multiple heat and pollution sources and two distinct ventilation system configurations. It predicts pollutant dispersion at the breathing plane under simultaneous variations in ventilation rates and air supply temperatures. The model was trained and validated using high-quality computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation data. Results show that the cDCGAN can generate rapid predictions within seconds, providing reasonable accuracy in capturing the overall distribution and concentration levels of pollutants, with a mean absolute percentage error ranging from 13 % to 15 % when compared to CFD simulations. Despite some limitations in reproducing small-scale flow features, the model's ability to handle multiple system parameters and efficiently predict complex flow phenomena with limited training data highlights its value and potential. The methodology is adaptable to a range of indoor and outdoor environments and can be extended to estimate other flow variables and incorporate additional system parameters, making it a promising tool for applications requiring speed and efficiency when analyzing a large number of flow and dispersion scenarios.}

abstract = {High resolution of post-stack seismic data assists in better interpretation of subsurface structures as well as high accuracy of impedance inversion. Therefore, geophysicists consistently strive to acquire higher resolution seismic images in petroleum exploration. Although there have been successful applications of conventional signal processing and machine learning for post-stack seismic resolution enhancement, there is limited reference to the seismic applications of the recent emergence and rapid development of generative artificial intelligence. Hence, we propose to apply diffusion models, among the most popular generative models, to enhance seismic resolution. Specifically, we apply the classic diffusion model—denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), conditioned on the seismic data in low resolution, to reconstruct corresponding high-resolution images. Herein the entire scheme is referred to as SeisResoDiff. To provide a comprehensive and clear understanding of SeisResoDiff, we introduce the basic theories of diffusion models and detail the optimization objective's derivation with the aid of diagrams and algorithms. For implementation, we first propose a practical workflow to acquire abundant training data based on the generated pseudo-wells. Subsequently, we apply the trained model to both synthetic and field datasets, evaluating the results in three aspects: the appearance of seismic sections and slices in the time domain, frequency spectra, and comparisons with the synthetic data using real well-logging data at the well locations. The results demonstrate not only effective seismic resolution enhancement, but also additional denoising by the diffusion model. Experimental comparisons indicate that training the model on noisy data, which are more realistic, outperforms training on clean data. The proposed scheme demonstrates superiority over some conventional methods in high-resolution reconstruction and denoising ability, yielding more competitive results compared to our previous research.}

abstract = {A device-free localization system is a technology for tracking targets or individuals without requiring them to carry any electronic devices. The system works by monitoring and processing changes in the received signal strength to detect changes in the environment. However, due to unreliable wireless communications and radio-based tracking solutions, an efficient system concerning both wireless communication and tracking performance should be developed. This paper presents a study of the 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 device-free localization system, focusing on the effectiveness of wireless network protocols and the accuracy of localization algorithms. The novelty and contribution of our work is that we develop a modified desync protocol for network synchronization and the weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm for location tracking. The study provides both simulation and experimental evaluations, considering hardware configurations such as the CC2538 + CC2592 device. Results demonstrate that the modified desync protocol can effectively operate in real-world environments. The network’s performance is evaluated through the packet delivery ratios for different network sizes and the convergence time, which refers to the ability to restore synchronization among network nodes. In our experiment case, the packet delivery ratio and the convergence time for a twenty-node network size are 97.98 % and 6.976 s, respectively. In addition, the weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm with an additional solution provides a high estimation accuracy of 99.93 % as accessed from various fixed human locations. Results also indicate that our algorithm can track the locations of a movement person, achieving an average accuracy of 85.75 % for different movement patterns. Finally, we suggest that the effect of new generative artificial intelligence approaches in this field should be investigated.}

This study proposes a multi-perspective mapping approach that integrates Kansei engineering with deep learning. Firstly, user core imagery is collected and mined through big data. Secondly, Kernels Network (KNet) semantic segmentation model, Residual Networks (ResNet) tri-view (front/side/rear) score prediction model and fully connected network (FCN) feature fusion model are integrated to construct a multi-view feature mapping system. Finally, the optimal combination of morphological elements is explored based on the Elite Genetic Algorithm (EGA), and the scheme is validated through generative artificial intelligence (AI) workflow. The experimental results demonstrate that, employing “Cool” as a case study, the three-view scheme and the combination scheme devised by this research process exhibit substantial superiority over the majority of the samples. Under identical parameters, the scheme with decision constraints surpasses the randomly generated scheme in terms of perceptual scores and stability. The performance of the test set and the experimental results collectively substantiate the model’s validity. This workflow—covering preference extraction, morphological decomposition, AI-driven generation, and validation—provides a scalable framework for new energy vehicle exterior design. It also demonstrates novel applications of Kansei engineering in multi-view fusion and generative form design.}

Introduction
L’intelligence artificielle (IA) est notamment utilisée pour automatiser l’extraction de données, avec l’aide d’agents conversationnels tels que ChatGPT. Il reste à évaluer si ces outils peuvent extraire des données d’articles scientifiques avec une précision comparable à celle des humains dans le domaine pharmaceutique. L’objectif est d’évaluer la conformité des données extraites par ChatGPT 4.0 en comparaison avec celles extraites par des étudiants en pharmacie, dans le cadre de la mise à jour de la plateforme impactpharmacie.org.
Matériel et méthodes
Cent articles pharmaceutiques ont été analysés. ChatGPT 4.0 a été programmé par un prompt et a été interrogé par 18 questions pour chaque article afin d’en extraire les données ciblées. Elles ont ensuite été comparées à celles préalablement validées et intégrées dans la plateforme par cinq étudiants en pharmacie. La conformité a été évaluée sur 23 critères incluant la description du type d’étude, les limites, l’intervention pharmaceutique et ce selon trois niveaux : conforme, partiellement conforme et non conforme. Le nombre et la nature des hallucinations ont également été relevés.
Résultats
La conformité des données extraites par ChatGPT comparées à celles des étudiants a atteint 77±19 % en moyenne. Cependant, des hallucinations d’IA ont été relevées dans 23 des 100 articles, et 30 % des paramètres (outcomes) (n=138/449) étaient absents de l’extraction. Une analyse complémentaire a été effectuée pour six revues systématiques et cinq méta-analyses.
Discussion
ChatGPT 4.0 est un outil prometteur pour extraire des données de la littérature scientifique pharmaceutique, mais une validation humaine reste nécessaire.
Summary
Introduction
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly conversational agents like ChatGPT, can be used to automate data extraction. However, it remains to be determined if these tools can extract scientific data with accuracy comparable to humans, especially in the field of pharmacy. Objective was to assess the compliance rate of data extracted by ChatGPT 4.0 compared to Impact Pharmacie entries.
Materials and methods
This is a descriptive comparative study. A random selection of 100 articles entered on Impact Pharmacie in 2024 was identified. ChatGPT 4.0 was programmed with a prompt and queried with 18 questions per article to extract targeted data. The responses were compared to data previously entered into the Impact Pharmacie platform by pharmacy students following a standardized operating procedure. Compliance was assessed across 23 criteria (e.g., study type description, pharmaceutical intervention description, limitations) and categorized into three levels: compliant, partially compliant, and non-compliant. The number and nature of AI hallucinations were also recorded.
Results
The compliance rate of data extracted by ChatGPT compared to student-entered data averaged 77±19%. However, AI hallucinations were observed in 23 out of 100 articles, and 30% of parameters (n=138/449) were missing from the extraction.
Discussion
ChatGPT 4.0 is a promising tool to support data extraction from pharmaceutical scientific literature, but human validation remains essential to ensure the accuracy of the information.}

To evaluate the agreement and performance of four large language models (LLMs)—ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, Leny-ai, and MediSearch—in diagnosing and classifying Dry Eye Disease (DED), compared to clinician judgment and Dry Eye Workshop-II (DEWS-II) criteria.
Methods
A standardized prompt incorporating retrospective clinical and symptomatic data from patients with suspected DED referred to a dry eye clinic was developed. LLMs were evaluated for diagnosis (DED vs. no DED) and classification (aqueous-deficient, evaporative, mixed-component). Agreement was assessed using Cohen’s-kappa (Cκ) and Fleiss’-kappa (Fκ). Balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score were calculated.
Results
Among 338 patients (78.6 % female, mean age 53.2 years), clinicians diagnosed DED in 300, and DEWS-II criteria identified 234. LLMs showed high agreement with clinicians for DED diagnosis (93 %–99 %, Cκ: 0.81–0.86). Subtype agreement was lower (aqueous-deficient: 0 %–18 %, evaporative: 4 %–80 %, mixed-component: 22 %–92 %; Fκ: −0.20 to −0.10). Diagnostic balanced accuracy was 48 %–56 %, with high sensitivity (93 %–99 %) but low specificity (0 %–16 %). Subtype balanced accuracy and F1 score ranged from 33 %-81 % 0 %–71 %, respectively. Compared to DEWS-II, agreement for DED diagnosis remained high (96 %–99 %) but with weaker Cκ (0.52–0.58). Subtype agreement was again low (aqueous-deficient: 0 %–20 %, evaporative: 9 %–68 %, mixed-component: 16 %–75 %; Fκ: −0.09 to −0.02). Diagnostic balanced accuracy was 49 %–56 %, sensitivity 97 %–99 %, and specificity 5 %–16 %. Subtype balanced accuracy ranged from 43 % to 56 %, F1 score 0–68.
Conclusion
LLMs showed strong agreement and high sensitivity for DED diagnosis but limited specificity and poor subtype classification, mirroring clinical challenges and highlighting risks of overdiagnosis.}

This has increased concerns from both scholars and practitioners regarding the potential impacts of ChatGPT on students' learning. However, research on higher education students' adoption of ChatGPT is still scant. Drawing on the modified technology acceptance model (TAM) and a sample of 1389 higher education students recruited in 11 universities in Vietnam with a stratified random sampling approach, the findings of this study indicated that effort expectancy not only directly affected students' actual usage of ChatGPT, but also serially indirectly increased their actual use of ChatGPT through performance expectancy and intentions to use ChatGPT. Additionally, knowledge sharing was found to significantly increase higher education students’ transformation from having the intention to use ChatGPT to actual users of ChatGPT. The theoretical and managerial implications of this are discussed in this paper in order to gain benefits and manage the potential threats from this new technology.}

To fill this research gap, this study presents a natural experiment that examines student use or non-use of GenAI tools in engineering design tasks in an undergraduate course. In this experiment, the participants (n = 403) were provided with unconstrained access to a GPT 4.0-empowered chatbot and were allowed to use it for their design projects voluntarily. Overall, 59.80 % of the students reported substantial use of GenAI in their design projects, and 40.20 % showed limited or no use. Those adopters used GenAI to aid idea generation and brainstorming, mediate discussions with instructors/TA, overcome non-technical expertise gaps, and optimize their design solutions. Conversely, non-adopters attributed their reluctance and rejection to inherent limitations in GenAI outputs, misalignment between GenAI functionalities and project needs, a lack of adaptation and prompt skills, and unclear benefits of GenAI use for personal growth. This study challenges the popular assumption of naturally active GenAI adoption among university students. It identifies three major factors—task characteristics, decision-maker characteristics, and context characteristics—that shape students' adoption of and interaction with GenAI. The findings highlight the need of establishing a consensus across various stakeholders (i.e., students, instructors, curriculum developers, policymakers, and others), while calling for adaptation and evidence-based decision-making in integrating GenAI tools into engineering education.}

The latter have become a pervasive challenge in modern societies, with over 300,000 yearly victims in the US alone. An increasing number of those attacks is conducted via voice communication, be it through machine-generated ‘robocalls’ or human actors. The goals of ‘social engineers’ can be manifold, from outright fraud to more subtle forms of persuasion. Accordingly, social engineers adopt multi-faceted strategies for voice-based attacks, utilising a variety of ‘tricks’ to exert influence and achieve their goals. Importantly, while organisations have set in place a series of guardrails against other types of SE attacks, voice calls still remain ‘open ground’ for potential bad actors. In the present contribution, we provide an overview of the existing speech technology subfields that need to coalesce into a protective net against one of the major challenges to societies worldwide. Given the dearth of speech science and technology works targeting this issue, we have opted for a narrative review that bridges the gap between the existing psychological literature on the topic and research that has been pursued in parallel by the speech community on some of the constituent constructs. Our review reveals that very little literature exists on addressing this very important topic from a speech technology perspective, an omission further exacerbated by the lack of available data. Thus, our main goal is to highlight this gap and sketch out a roadmap to mitigate it, beginning with the psychological underpinnings of vishing, which primarily include deception and persuasion strategies, continuing with the speech-based approaches that can be used to detect those, as well as the generation and detection of AI-based vishing attempts, and close with a discussion of ethical and legal considerations.}

OpenAI's ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM), is a powerful tool across domains, designed for text and code generation, fostering collaboration, especially in public health. Investigating the role of this advanced LLM chatbot in assisting public health practitioners in shaping disease transmission models to inform infection control strategies, marks a new era in infectious disease epidemiology research. This study used a case study to illustrate how ChatGPT collaborates with a public health practitioner in co-designing a mathematical transmission model.
Methods
Using natural conversation, the practitioner initiated a dialogue involving an iterative process of code generation, refinement, and debugging with ChatGPT to develop a model to fit 10 days of prevalence data to estimate two key epidemiological parameters: i) basic reproductive number (Ro) and ii) final epidemic size. Verification and validation processes are conducted to ensure the accuracy and functionality of the final model.
Results
ChatGPT developed a validated transmission model which replicated the epidemic curve and gave estimates of Ro of 4.19 (95 % CI: 4.13- 4.26) and a final epidemic size of 98.3 % of the population within 60 days. It highlighted the advantages of using maximum likelihood estimation with Poisson distribution over least squares method.
Conclusion
Integration of LLM in medical research accelerates model development, reducing technical barriers for health practitioners, democratizing access to advanced modeling and potentially enhancing pandemic preparedness globally, particularly in resource-constrained populations.}

To address the fundamental challenges of grain shape interpolation, reconstruction, and generation, a deep learning approach is proposed. Firstly, the fast-sweeping method is introduced to rapidly realize the calculation of burning surface regression and performance curve prediction. Secondly, a deep neural field with conditional auto-decoder is constructed, which can output the phase field of the grain shape matching the target performance curve according to a latent vector and conditional vector. Thirdly, a latent denoising diffusion probability model is developed to realize grain generation in latent space. The latent vector can be generated from a Gauss noisy through a stochastic process. Moreover, the intensity of classifier-free guidance can be manipulated to adjust the diversity of the results. Finally, the grain shape interpolation, reconstruction, and generation are verified through typical cases. All the optimal and suboptimal solutions are successfully identified by our model. The reconstructed and generated dual-thrust grain achieves performance matching degrees of 0.9852 and 0.9870, respectively, which closely align with the best results reported in previous method of single-objective evolutionary neural network. Consequently, the deep neural field and generative diffusion model proposed in this study offer promising solutions to grain reverse design problems. These findings can provide a solid foundation for future investigations into complex 3D grain reverse design.}

This structured narrative review identified and evaluated studies applying AI and ML in transfusion medicine. A search of PubMed and Scopus for articles published between January 2018 and April 2025 yielded 565 publications. Studies were included if they applied AI or ML techniques, focused on transfusion management or decision support, and were evaluated using electronic health records or expert review. Four exemplar studies were selected, each representing a distinct AI paradigm: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and generative learning. These studies were critically appraised for methodological rigor, clinical relevance, and potential for implementation in practice. The reviewed studies reflected a clear shift from traditional analytic methods toward more advanced computational approaches to improve prediction accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and support clinical decision-making. Three overarching themes emerged: the need to balance model complexity with interpretability and clinical feasibility; the impact of data quality and preprocessing on model performance and fairness; and the barriers to broader applicability and cross-institutional deployment. As technological barriers continue to decline, future challenges will increasingly center on privacy regulations, infrastructure constraints, and aligning model complexity with practical utility. Thoughtful integration of these considerations through scalable, clinical-grade, and transparent solutions will be critical in realizing the full potential of AI and ML in transfusion medicine.}

However, limited information is available about how they assess and distinguish between essays produced by AI and human authors.

Findings showed that essays by a native English-speaking (NS) lecturer and ChatGPT were rated highly. Meanwhile, essays by an NS college student, non-native English-speaking (NNS) college student, and NNS lecturer scored lower, which made them distinguishable from an AI-generated text. The study also revealed that teachers could not consistently identify the AI-generated text, particularly those written by an NS professional. These findings were attributed to teachers’ past engagement with AI writing tools, familiarity with common L2 learner errors, and exposure to native and non-native English writing. From these results, implications for L2 writing instruction and future research are discussed.}

abstract = {ChatGPT is changing our working lives, conjuring visions of revolutionary shifts ahead. ChatGPT is a chatbot based on generative artificial intelligence, which can, e.g., write computer code. This article explores how it might shape the future labour market situation of software engineers. A Delphi study with 14 experts was conducted in Finland. The first round identified possible futures, and the second round assessed their probabilities. Five scenarios prevailed: the unlikely scenario that the status quo persists; the ambivalent scenario that ChatGPT can replace software engineers to a large extent; the likely scenario that computer departments in startups embrace ChatGPT; the likely scenario that ChatGPT use proliferates among software engineers to increase productivity; and the highly likely scenario that ChatGPT makes computer programming accessible to the masses. Findings contradict previous discussions that technological advancements might take over especially routine tasks. ChatGPT can also take over non-routine tasks. Moreover, findings underline that digitalisation does not only bring about a choice between upskilling and employability loss, but also a democratisation of knowledge and expertise. Software engineers and companies might use the findings as an impetus for upskilling, while universities might feel nudged to incorporate ChatGPT more strongly into their curricula.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) devices are commonly used in numerous interventional procedures across various parts of the body, necessitating multiple scans per procedure, which results in significant radiation exposure for both doctors and patients. Inspired by generative artificial intelligence techniques, this study proposes GenDSA, a large-scale pretrained multi-frame generative model-based real-time and low-dose DSA imaging system.
Methods
GenDSA was developed to generate 1-, 2-, and 3-frame sequences following each real frame. A large-scale dataset comprising ∼3 million DSA images from 27,117 patients across 10 hospitals was constructed to pretrain, fine-tune, and validate GenDSA. Two other datasets from 25 hospitals were used for evaluation. Objective evaluations included SSIM and PSNR. Five interventional radiologists independently assessed the quality of the generated frames using the Likert scale and visual Turing test. Scoring consistency among the radiologists was measured using the Kendall coefficient of concordance (W). The Fleiss’ kappa values were used for inter-rater agreement analysis for visual Turing tests.
Findings
Using only one-third of the clinical radiation dose, videos generated by GenDSA were perfectly consistent with real videos. Objective evaluations demonstrated that GenDSA’s performance (PSNR = 36.83, SSIM = 0.911, generation time = 0.07 s/frame) surpassed state-of-the-art algorithms. Subjective ratings and statistical results from five doctors indicated no significant difference between real and generated videos. Furthermore, the generated videos were comparable to real videos in overall quality (4.905 vs. 4.935) and lesion assessment (4.825 vs. 4.860).
Conclusions
With clear clinical and translational values, the developed GenDSA can significantly reduce radiation damage to both doctors and patients during DSA-guided procedures.

Generative AI offers powerful capabilities for extracting and mining data features and generating new design solutions efficiently through inference. These strengths provide critical technical support for intelligent CFRD design, facilitating the full utilization of design data, and significantly improving design efficiency and quality. However, CFRD design is a highly specialized and complex task, and conventional generative AI techniques often fail to produce professional-grade designs. In response to this challenge, this study explored generative intelligent design methods specifically for the critical task of CFRD profile design. An intelligent design method based on feature-fusion generative adversarial networks (GANs) for CFRD profile solutions is proposed. This approach enables the dense representation and augmentation of design data, GAN model training, and automated evaluation, thereby addressing the key challenge of fusing small-sample multimodal image-parameter data. The effectiveness of the intelligent design method for CFRD profiles was validated through algorithm analysis and case studies. The design efficiency was nearly 10 times higher than that of traditional engineer-driven designs, reducing the time required from 1–2 h to approximately 6 min. The proposed intelligent design approach has great potential and provides valuable insights for the further development of intelligent design of rockfill dams.}

However, existing approaches often rely on manually crafted visual description texts, which lack robustness and generalizability in real-world production settings. This limitation is evident as these methods struggle to adapt to new or evolving anomalies, where original prompts fail to generalize beyond their initial design. This paper proposes a novel method, Multi-agent Language Models with CLIP (MALM-CLIP), which integrates the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with CLIP within a multi-agent framework. In this system, specialized agents handle different subtasks such as prompt generation and model evaluation, enabling automated and context-aware multimodal information fusion. By eliminating manual prompt engineering, MALM-CLIP enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection. Experimental results on standard datasets such as MVTec and VisA demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in detecting image-level anomalies with minimal training data. This work highlights the potential of combining Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and multi-agent systems for robust few-shot industrial anomaly detection.}

Therefore, early-stage GenAI distorts the incentives of consumers and reduces their welfare.

However, current generative methods such as procedural modeling and parametric modeling exhibit two primary limitations. Firstly, they rely on drawings or images instead of more flexible and structured data inputs. Secondly, they often neglect the spatial sequence of the façade in the optimization process. This paper introduces a graph-enabled parametric modeling approach (GEPMA) for façade layout generation. The approach utilizes graphs to represent structural data inputs and incorporates spatial sequence-aware optimization for the output. The process begins by decoding a hierarchical attributed graph (HAG) to extract essential façade information and define key modeling parameters. Facades are then generated and simulated based on two predefined objectives: energy use intensity (EUI) and spatial daylight autonomy (sDA). Subsequently, the façade variants are optimized under four different spatial sequences using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). GEPMA was evaluated through a case study of a residential building in China. The optimal solutions improved sDA by an average of 7.71 % (up to 12.02 %) and reduced EUI by an average of 0.40 % (up to 0.62 %) compared to the baseline façade. This study contributes to the field of generative design by presenting a flexible and editable methodology and providing practical insights for façade design.}

abstract = {Background
Digital health interventions show promise for weight management. However, few text-based behavior change interventions have been designed to support patients receiving intragastric balloons, and none have simultaneously evaluated weight loss, psychological well-being, and behavior change despite the crucial interplay of these factors in weight management.
Objective
This study aims to assess whether a health coach–led, asynchronous, text-based digital behavior change coaching intervention (DBCCI) delivered to participants receiving an intragastric balloon and its aftercare program was feasible and acceptable to participants and supported improved outcomes, including weight loss, psychological well-being, and lifestyle behavior change conducive to weight loss maintenance.
Methods
This 12-month, single-arm prospective study enrolled adults aged 21 to 65 years with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 receiving a procedureless intragastric balloon (PIGB) at 5 bariatric clinics in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Participants received the DBCCI and the clinic-led PIGB aftercare program (remotely delivered) for 6 months after PIGB placement and then no intervention for an additional 6 months. The DBCCI was an evidence-based, personalized intervention wherein health coaches supported participants via exchanged asynchronous in-app text-based messages. Over the 12-month study, we assessed percentage of total body weight loss and psychological well-being via self-administered validated questionnaires (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life–Lite–Clinical Trials Version, Loss of Control Over Eating Scale–Brief, Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire–Short Form, and Barriers to Being Active Quiz). Participant engagement with and acceptability of the intervention were assessed via self-reported surveys.
Results
Overall, 107 participants (n=96, 89.7% female; mean baseline BMI 35.4, SD 5.4 kg/m2) were included in the analysis. Mean total body weight loss was 13.5% (SEM 2.3%) at the end of the DBCCI and 11.22% (SEM 2.3%) at the 12-month follow-up (P<.001). Improvements were observed for all psychological well-being measures throughout the 12 months except for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (improvement at month 1) and Barriers to Being Active Quiz (improvements at months 3 and 6). Surveys showed high levels of engagement with and acceptability of the DBCCI.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that the health coach–led, asynchronous, text-based DBCCI was engaging and acceptable to participants with overweight and obesity. The DBCCI, delivered alongside the PIGB and its aftercare program, supported improved weight loss outcomes and psychological well-being versus baseline and was associated with lifestyle behavior changes known to help achieve and maintain long-term weight loss and improved health outcomes. Follow-up findings suggest a potential need for longer-term, more intense coaching to focus on weight loss maintenance and support ongoing self-coaching. This could be achieved by leveraging generative artificial intelligence to provide ongoing automated behavior change coaching support to augment human-led care.

The notion of using a generative artificial intelligence (AI) engine for text composition has gained excessive popularity among students, educators and researchers, following the introduction of ChatGPT. However, this has added another dimension to the daunting task of verifying originality in academic writing. Consequently, the market for detecting artificially generated content has seen a mushroom growth of tools that claim to be more than 90% accurate in sensing artificially written content.
Design/methodology/approach
This research evaluates the capabilities of some highly mentioned AI detection tools to separate reality from their hyperbolic claims. For this purpose, eight AI engines have been tested on four different types of data, which cover the different ways of using ChatGPT. These types are Original, Paraphrased by AI, 100% AI generated and 100% AI generated with Contextual Information. The AI index recorded by these tools against the datasets was evaluated as an indicator of their performance.
Findings
The resulting figures of cumulative mean validate that these tools excel at identifying human generated content (1.71% AI content) and perform reasonably well in labelling AI generated content (76.85% AI content). However, they are perplexed by the scenarios where the content is either paraphrased by the AI (39.42% AI content) or generated by giving a precise context for the output (60.1% AI content).
Originality/value
This paper evaluates different services for the detection of AI-generated content to verify academic integrity in research work and higher education and provides new insights into their performance.}

abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence puts forward higher requirements for efficient neural network architecture design. Traditional neural architecture search (NAS) focuses on single-objective optimization, while multi-objective NAS (MONAS) needs to balance performance, parameter number, inference delay and other objectives at the same time. The existing methods based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms often deviate from the optimal search direction due to target conflict, and rely on time-consuming weight pre-training, which seriously limits the practical application efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-archive guided decomposition-based DANAS algorithm. The algorithm employs a dynamic decomposition strategy to map the multi-objective space into a set of subproblems. A convergence archive is utilized to preserve solutions approximating the Pareto front, while a diversity archive maintains the distribution characteristics of the solution set. The dual-archive mechanism effectively coordinates exploitation and exploration during the search process. On this basis, two training-free metrics are introduced, and an efficient variant without parameter training called TF-DANAS is proposed, which greatly reduces the search cost. In EvoXbench, NAS-Bench-101,and NAS-Bench-201 benchmark tests, DANAS algorithm obtains the optimal HV value on 57.6% of the test sets on EvoXbench. On NAS-Bench-101, the proposed method achieved a top average accuracy of 93.83% on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, it attained average accuracies of 94.34%, 73.42%, and 46.50% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120 respectively when evaluated on NAS-Bench-201.}

We use Molecular Dynamics (MD) to simulate uniaxial tension on architected graphene, extract the von Mises stress field in mechanical loading, and use the results to train a fine-tuned generative AI model through a Low-Rank Adaptation method. This model enables the freely designed architected graphene structures and predicts its associated stress field in uniaxial tension loading through simple descriptive language. We demonstrate that the fine-tuned model can be established with a few training images and can quantitatively predict the stress field for graphene with various defect geometries and distributions not included in the training set. We validate the accuracy of the stress field with MD simulations. Moreover, we illustrate that our generative AI model can predict the stress field from a schematic drawing of the architected graphene through image-to-image generation. These features underscore the promising future for employing advanced generative AI models in end-to-end advanced nanomaterial design and characterization, enabling the creation of functional, structural materials without using complex numerical modeling and data processing.}

However, existing digital therapy platforms fall short of providing personalization and real-time interaction, often leading to generic and ineffective responses that fail to meet individual psychological needs. These platforms rely on costly therapists or inadequately trained assistants, which limits their effectiveness. Additionally, the centralized systems used to manage therapy sessions lack adequate traceability, trust, and security, which are critical for users’ confidence in the process. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based solution integrated with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to deliver superior Metaverse-based therapy sessions that are decentralized, traceable, trustworthy, secure, and access-controlled.

A cost analysis reveals that user access control operations incur the highest gas costs, while simpler operations remain cost-efficient. Compared to existing digital mental health platforms, our system offers superior access control, automation, security, and user interaction through the integration of blockchain, NFTs, and decentralized storage.

Due to their agility and reach, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are central to this transition. However, many SMEs lack access to robust information systems (ISs) that consolidate government initiatives, industry trends, and broader water-related data, impeding sustainable adoption. This study introduces SustainWater Bot, a chatbot driven by generative artificial Intelligence (GenAI), including large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Designed to fill this information gap, SustainWater Bot addresses the shortcomings of conventional LLMs, such as information misalignment, over-complexity, and information deficiencies. RAG enables semantic consolidation of various sources, such as news, government reports, industry insights, academic research, and social media, into an integrated IS. The evaluation results showed that RAG with LLM-based methods outperformed traditional information retrieval (IR) techniques, with Llama3.2:3b achieving top scores in precision (95 %), completeness (95 %), and exact match (90 %). Traditional IR techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and best matching 25 (BM25) performed lower but offered quicker responses. SustainWater Bot supports informed decision-making through a question-answering (QA) framework that delivers relevant insights on sustainable urban water initiatives (SUWIs). It is built on open-source technologies and offers SMEs a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable solution to enhance eco-friendly water practices and operational efficiency.}

abstract = {In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has gained momentum and created extremely realistic synthetic multimedia content that can spread misinformation and mislead society. Deepfake detection is a technique consisting of frameworks, algorithms and approaches to predict manipulated contents namely, image, audio and video. To this end, we have analyzed and explored various deepfake detection frameworks by categorizing them as single-modal or multi-modal approaches. To provide better understanding and clarity, single-modal approaches are further categorized as conventional and advanced techniques. Conventional techniques extract complementary handcrafted features and classify them using machine-learning-based algorithms. On the other hand, advanced techniques adopt deep learning and hybrid algorithms to detect deepfakes. Multi-modal techniques utilize a mixture of two or more modalities for feature extraction and fuse them to obtain the final classification scores. These techniques are also categorized either as deep learning or hybrid techniques. The complementary features, multiple modalities, and deep learning models are fused adaptively using score-level or feature-level fusion. The advantages, features, practical applications, and limitations under each category are highlighted to address the challenges and determine future trends to counter deepfakes. In addition, recommendations are also elaborated to evaluate the potential of artificial intelligence in deepfake detection for providing a safer and more reliable digital world.}

abstract = {Background
A personal statement is a common requirement in medical residency and fellowship applications. Generative artificial intelligence may be used to create a personal statement for these applications.
Methods
Two personal statements were created using OpenAI’s Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and two applicant-written statements were collected. A survey was sent to obstetric anesthesia fellowship program directors in the United States to assess the perceived readability, authenticity, and originality of the four personal statements. In addition, the survey assessed perceptions of applicants who use artificial intelligence to write a personal statement, including their integrity, work ethic, reliability, intelligence, and English proficiency.
Results
Surveyed fellowship directors could not accurately discern whether statements were applicant-written or artificial intelligence-generated. The artificial intelligence-generated personal statements were rated as more readable and original than the applicant-written statements. Most program directors were moderately or extremely concerned about the applicant’s integrity, work ethic, and reliability if they suspected the applicant utilized ChatGPT.
Conclusions
Program directors could not accurately discern if the statements were written by a person or artificial intelligence and would have concerns about an applicant suspected of using artificial intelligence. Medical training programs may benefit from outlining their expectations regarding applicants’ use of artificial intelligence.}

Prior research on hospitality communication has not solved this issue, as AI-generated images are occasionally promoted as effective marketing tools across various service contexts, while other scholars caution against their use due to the significant concerns they may trigger among consumers. Following a mixed-methods approach to find boundary conditions, our research reveals that consumers prefer hospitality services advertised with real images, rather than those featuring AI-generated images. Nevertheless, this effect is moderated by two key factors. In particular, the research reveals that the negative influence of using generative AI images on intentions to use and recommend the service are strengthened for hedonic rather than utilitarian services, and for highly rather than lowly involved customers. A qualitative study further explores the reasons behind this rejection, highlighting that customers perceive companies using AI-generated images as impersonal, less professional, lacking credibility, and potentially misleading, as they impede customers’ ability to envision the actual experience. Implications for management suggest that, while generative AI holds promise for enhancing communication, companies should use AI-generated images with caution. The discussion also proposes future research directions to explore the broader implications of AI use in marketing.}

GenAI's impact on learning outcomes, pedagogy, and assessment is crucial for reforming and advancing the workforce. This qualitative study aims to investigate student perspectives on GenAI's impact on higher education. The study uses an initial conceptual framework driven by a systematic literature review to investigate the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. This framework serves as an initial data collection and analysis framework. A sample of 51 students from three research-intensive universities was selected for this study. Thematic analysis identified three themes and 10 subthemes. The findings suggest that future higher education should be transformed to train students to be future-ready for employment in a society powered by GenAI. They suggest new learning outcomes—skills in learning and teaching with GenAI, AI literacy—and emphasize the significance of interdisciplinarity and maker learning, with assessment focusing on in-class and hands-on activities. They recommend six future research directions – competence for future workforce and its self-assessment measures, AI literacy or competency measures, new literacies and their relationships, interdisciplinary teaching, Innovative pedagogies and their evaluation, new assessment and its acceptance.}

LLMs can revolutionize surgical education by providing personalized learning experiences and accelerating skill acquisition. Intelligent decision support systems powered by LLMs can assist surgeons in making complex decisions, optimizing surgical workflows, and improving patient outcomes. Moreover, LLMs can automate surgical reporting and generate personalized patient education materials, streamlining documentation and improving patient engagement. However, challenges such as data scarcity, surgical semantic capture, real-time inference, and integration with existing systems need to be addressed for successful LLM integration. The future of laparoscopic surgery lies in the seamless integration of LLMs, enabling autonomous robotic surgery, predictive surgical planning, intraoperative decision support, virtual surgical assistants, and continuous learning.

abstract = {This study investigates the data requirements of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), for reliable data augmentation in energy applications. Generative AI, though seen as a solution to data limitations, requires substantial data to learn meaningful distributions—a challenge often overlooked. This study addresses the challenge through synthetic data generation for critical heat flux (CHF) and power grid demand, focusing on renewable and nuclear energy. Two variants of GAN employed are conditional GAN (cGAN) and Wasserstein GAN (wGAN). Our findings include the strong dependency of GAN on data size, with performance declining on smaller datasets and varying performance when generalizing to unseen experiments. Mass flux and heated length significantly influence CHF predictions. wGAN is more robust to feature exclusion, making it suitable for constrained synthetic data generation. In energy demand forecasting, wGAN performed well for solar, wind, and load predictions. Longer lookback hours and larger datasets improved predictions, especially for load power. Seasonal variations posed challenges, with wGAN achieving a relatively high error of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.32 for load power prediction, compared to RMSE of 0.07 under same-season conditions. Feature exclusions impacted cGAN the most, while wGAN showed greater robustness. This study concludes that, while generative AI is effective for data augmentation, it requires substantial data and careful training to generate realistic synthetic data and generalize to new experiments in engineering applications.}

To achieve this, we propose HybridGAD, a novel hybrid model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) architectures with an attention mechanism. Our methodology involves training this hybrid model on a dataset of radiology abstracts, encompassing texts generated by AI, paraphrased by AI, and written by humans. The major findings of our analysis indicate that HybridGAD achieves a high accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art models. This high performance is attributed to the model’s ability to effectively capture the contextual nuances and structural differences between AI-generated and human-written texts. In conclusion, HybridGAD not only enhances the accuracy of text classification in the field of radiology but also paves the way for more advanced medical diagnostic processes by ensuring the authenticity of textual information. Future research will focus on integrating textual and visual data for comprehensive radiology assessments and improving model generalization with partially labeled data. This study underscores the potential of HybridGAD in transforming medical text classification and highlights its applicability in ensuring the integrity and reliability of research in healthcare and beyond.}

Some of these stages can be partially or fully automated using industrial large models (LMs), such as generative and large language models. The key to quick and cost-effective order fulfillment is the orchestration of group interactions, or a group chat, between the stakeholders and LMs in garment design. However, certain unaddressed aspects, such as knowledge retention, generalization, and complexity of group interaction, are critical to realizing group chat for garment design. This study proposes a framework called ChatFashion for group chat in garment design. Transformer, a core construct of the proposed framework, orchestrates interaction among stakeholders and industrial LMs. It undergoes an evolution with the intelligence it picks up from its interaction with diverse stakeholders and industrial LMs, allowing it to act as a one-stop solution for multidisciplinary design needs. This study contributes to theory in the following aspects. First, it proposes transformers to eliminate concerns about knowledge retention by industrial LMs. Second, while other studies focus on the benefits of industrial LMs to simplify individual stages in garment design, this study introduces the design and demonstration of a ChatFashion framework for collaborative garment designing using industrial LMs. Finally, this study advances the literature on prompt engineering of industrial LMs by utilizing collaborative learning (or models learning from each other) to capture and orchestrate the group chat among stakeholders, signifying its practicality and value for research in garment design.}

abstract = {Despite recent advances, the adoption of computer vision methods into clinical and commercial applications has been hampered by the limited availability of accurate ground truth tissue annotations required to train robust supervised models. Generating such ground truth can be accelerated by annotating tissue molecularly using immunofluorescence (IF) staining and mapping these annotations to a post-IF hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (terminal H&E) stain. Mapping the annotations between IF and terminal H&E increases both the scale and accuracy by which ground truth could be generated. However, discrepancies between terminal H&E and conventional H&E caused by IF tissue processing have limited this implementation. We sought to overcome this challenge and achieve compatibility between these parallel modalities using synthetic image generation, in which a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network was applied to transfer the appearance of conventional H&E such that it emulates terminal H&E. These synthetic emulations allowed us to train a deep learning model for the segmentation of epithelium in terminal H&E that could be validated against the IF staining of epithelial-based cytokeratins. The combination of this segmentation model with the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network stain transfer model enabled performative epithelium segmentation in conventional H&E images. The approach demonstrates that the training of accurate segmentation models for the breadth of conventional H&E data can be executed free of human expert annotations by leveraging molecular annotation strategies such as IF, so long as the tissue impacts of the molecular annotation protocol are captured by generative models that can be deployed prior to the segmentation process.}

Our approach is underpinned by cycle-consistent generative adversarial neural networks trained on the National Unified Renal Translational Research Enterprise data set—the first UK-wide Biobank for chronic kidney disease—which features diverse data from 16 nephrology centers. Our work is divided into the following 4 main components: (1) we developed a virtual staining model, which infers PAS staining from H&E; (2) 2 board-certified pathologists assessed the virtual staining by attempting to distinguish it from real examples; (3) we trained a glomerular segmentation model using 3 independent renal segmentation data sets (Kidney Precision Medicine Project, Human BioMolecular Atlas Program [Kidney], and data by Jayapandian et al); and (4) we demonstrated the utility of virtual staining by inferring PAS staining from previously unseen H&E test images and applying our PAS-specific glomerular segmentation model. Each pathologist was able to identify 52.5% and 75.8% of the virtually stained images, respectively, showing an overlap in the variability of the authentic and synthetic staining. We discussed the utility of virtual staining in digital pathology, the need for pathology-specific testing with respect to chronic damage, and minimal changes and steps for incorporating more stains.

abstract = {Purpose
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care comes with increasing concerns about the use and integrity of the information it generates. Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) 3.5, Google Gemini, and Bing Copilot are free AI chatbot platforms that may be used for answering medical questions and disseminating medical information. Given that carpal tunnel syndrome accounts for 90% of all neuropathies, it is important to understand the accuracy of the information patients may be receiving. The purpose of this study is to determine the use and accuracy of responses generated by ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Bing Copilot in answering frequently asked questions about carpal tunnel syndrome.
Methods
Two independent authors scored responses using the DISCERN tool. DISCERN consists of 15 questions assessing health information on a five-point scale, with total scores ranging from 15 to 75 points. Then, a two-factor analysis of variance was conducted, with scorer and chatbot type as the factors.
Results
One-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in DISCERN scores among the three chatbots. The chatbots each scored in the “fair” range, with means of 45 for ChatGPT, 48 for Bing Copilot, and 46 for Google Gemini. The average Journal of the American Medical Association score for ChatGPT and Google Gemini surpassed that of Bing Copilot, with averages of 2.3, 2.3, and 1.8, respectively.
Conclusions
ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Bing Copilot platforms generated relatively reliable answers for potential patient questions about carpal tunnel syndrome. However, users should continue to be aware of the shortcomings of the information provided, given the lack of citations, potential for misconstrued information, and perpetuated biases that inherently come with using such platforms. Future studies should explore the response quality for less common orthopedic pathologies and assess patient perceptions of response readability to determine the value of AI as a patient resource across the medical field.

Researchers are calling for investigations into how GAI technology can be better utilized to support learning. Addressing this gap, this study integrates advanced AI technologies (i.e. the retrieval-based model, GAI model, and retrieval-augmented generation) to develop a CA aimed at enhancing students' engagement in OCW activities. Furthermore, a quasi-experiment involving 78 undergraduate students was conducted to explore the effects of this CA on students' engagement (including behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement) and group writing performance. The results indicate that the CA did not significantly impact behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, or group writing performance. However, it was found to significantly enhance students' cognitive engagement, particularly by supporting students in sharing opinions, explaining concepts, and engaging in analysis. This research offers both theoretical and practical implications for better utilizing GAI technology to facilitate OCW activities.}

Empirical design processes are increasingly inadequate for meeting high-performance and rapid designing for flexible supports under varying conditions. This study proposes a generative structural design approach based on diffusion model to establish the relationship between structural performance and existing sketches. A dataset of flexible support structures is prepared using a maze path-planning algorithm. The method can automatically generate initial feasible design solutions rapidly. A case study involving a 400 millimeter (mm) aperture reflector shows that the designed support achieves a surface shape accuracy of approximately 15 nanometer (nm) at room temperature and under 40 nm at −20 degrees Celsius (℃).

Many previous studies have focused on the generation of math word problems, which are difficult to meet the real teaching needs due to the single task-objective orientation and small differences in generation results. By fusing external knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), large language model (LLM) can generate a variety of math problems, but the generated results still have limitations such as poor knowledge consistency, uncontrollability, and high computational cost. In this paper, we propose the task of multi-objective math problem generation (MMPG). This task introduces the triple objectives of generation including “question type, knowledge point and difficulty” in respond to teaching needs in real scene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study considering multiple objectives on the process of math problem generation. Based on this, we further design an adaptive multi-level retrieval augmentation framework (AMRAF) for LLM to generate multi-objective math problems. This plug-and-play framework can effectively improve the generation performance without parameter tuning of the target model due to the fine-grained information retrieval and fusion. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and provide a benchmark for subsequent research, we construct an MMPG dataset containing 9,000 samples. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our framework.}

abstract = {This chapter delves into the concept of empathy in the context of generative artificial intelligence (AI), examining its significance in enhancing human-AI interactions while addressing the ethical challenges that arise. Empathy, defined as the ability to understand and share the feelings of another, is crucial for creating AI systems that foster meaningful and socially intelligent interactions. By embedding empathetic responses into AI design, developers can improve user experiences and engagement, making technology more relatable and effective. The chapter discusses various strategies for incorporating empathy into AI systems, such as leveraging natural language processing, affective computing, and emotional intelligence models. Through illustrative case studies, it highlights successful applications of empathetic AI, showcasing how they enhance user satisfaction. However, designing empathetic AI is fraught with challenges, including technical limitations and the complexity of accurately understanding emotional nuances. Ethical considerations surrounding empathetic AI are a major focus. The potential for emotional manipulation poses significant risks, necessitating discussions about authenticity and transparency. The chapter explores how empathetic interactions can respect user autonomy, ensuring that AI does not undermine decision-making abilities. Through case studies, the ethical dilemmas faced by emotional AI assistants and health-related AI systems are examined, illustrating the complexities of managing empathy in practice. Developing ethical guidelines for empathetic AI is essential, and the chapter advocates for the involvement of diverse stakeholders in the design process to address ethical concerns effectively. Looking to the future, the chapter discusses innovations in empathetic AI technologies and the need to anticipate emerging ethical challenges. It concludes with recommendations for building a robust framework that supports ethical empathy in AI, aiming to create systems that are both effective and aligned with ethical principles.}

It aims to examine how these students invest in critical digital literacies (CDL) that empower them to navigate invisible power relations of AI platforms and enact agentic language learning practices. Data was collected through an adapted questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, digital artifacts (e.g., screenshots of interactions with AI), and reflective journals. Using NVivo 12, an inductive thematic analysis approach (Braun & Clarke, 2021) was adopted to code data and generate the primary themes. The analysis revealed that participants' investment in CDL manifested through multiple interconnected dimensions. These participants invested in CDL by first establishing dispositional stances and mobilizing capital to demystify the black box of AI tools and developing critical awareness about power relations embedded in AI platforms. Participants also negotiated varying levels of agency in their AI-mediated informal digital learning of English (AI-IDLE), ranging from basic content consumption to sophisticated co-creative partnerships. By shedding light on the components of CDL that AI-IDLE learners need to develop, this paper provides implications for language educators and policymakers to design pedagogies of critical AI literacies and promote equitable and agentic AI-supported language learning practices outside of the classroom.}

abstract = {Background
Older adults are at higher risk for health issues, including mental health problems. This was especially apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, where older adults were simultaneously more vulnerable to the disease and the mental health concerns created by social distancing. Subsequently, the use of digital communication technology (DCT) became a critical option for maintaining social connectedness in older adults. Prior to the pandemic, the low uptake and use of technology by older adults was an established problem, known as the digital divide. However, not much is known about how this may have changed as a result of the pandemic.
Objective
This study aims to explore how older adults maintained social connectedness through DCT during the pandemic and to understand factors influencing the use and acceptance of DCT.
Methods
A mixed methods explorative field study was set up, involving surveys and interviews of 25 community-dwelling older adults (65-88 years old) living in the United Kingdom. The surveys included the internet acceptance questionnaire (based on the Technology Acceptance Model [TAM]); COVID-19 dysfunctional anxiety was captured using the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CAS). Background information (demographics, use of technology) was gathered before conducting semistructured interviews. We hypothesized that CAS would affect constructs of TAM and that predictive constructs of TAM would have remained valid during the pandemic. We also posited that there would be unidentified themes outside TAM that impacted the acceptance and use of DCT. We used the quantitative data to guide the semistructured interviews, which were then analyzed through thematic analysis to identify additional themes.
Results
Correlational analysis showed that CAS influences all constructs of TAM. We also saw that the predictive constructs of TAM, especially the perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU), remained valid during the pandemic. Common acceptance-influencing themes were encountered in both quantitative and qualitative analyses, with 3 matching the known constructs of TAM (PU, PEU, and behavioral intention). We identified 2 additional themes affecting acceptance, namely influence of the pandemic (situational context) and privacy and security concerns. DCT use (especially email and videoconferencing use) increased during the pandemic, but the results related to social networking sites were mixed.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted technology acceptance and use by older adults, encouraging their use of certain DCT apps (email and videoconferencing apps, such as WhatsApp). These apps helped insulate them from adverse effects (social isolation and loneliness). Other social networking apps, however, exerted a negative influence, increasing anxiety and a general feeling of negativity. Future studies should maximize older adult agency related to design, privacy, security, and user requirements for development. We also recommend that when studying DCT acceptance for older adults, our additional identified themes should be considered alongside the existing TAM constructs.}

abstract = {In the field of medicine, uncertainty is inherent. Physicians are asked to make decisions on a daily basis without complete certainty, whether it is in understanding the patient’s problem, performing the physical examination, interpreting the findings of diagnostic tests, or proposing a management plan. The reasons for this uncertainty are widespread, including the lack of knowledge about the patient, individual physician limitations, and the limited predictive power of objective diagnostic tools. This uncertainty poses significant problems in providing competent patient care. Research efforts and teaching are attempts to reduce uncertainty that have now become inherent to medicine. Despite this, uncertainty is rampant. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which are being rapidly developed and integrated into practice, may change the way we navigate uncertainty. In their strongest forms, AI tools may have the ability to improve data collection on diseases, patient beliefs, values, and preferences, thereby allowing more time for physician-patient communication. By using methods not previously considered, these tools hold the potential to reduce the uncertainty in medicine, such as those arising due to the lack of clinical information and provider skill and bias. Despite this possibility, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of AI tools in medical practice. In this viewpoint article, we discuss the impact of AI on medical uncertainty and discuss practical approaches to teaching the use of AI tools in medical schools and residency training programs, including AI ethics, real-world skills, and technological aptitude.}

However, the growing popularity and influence of models such as ChatGPT have raised concerns in education regarding academic integrity, as AI-generated content challenges the authenticity of student work and complicates traditional assessment practices. Existing plagiarism detection tools, such as Turnitin and GPTZero, attempt to identify AI-generated content; however, their reliability remains limited, as most struggle to accurately differentiate between human and AI essays. To address existing tools limitations, we propose a novel detection model leveraging three large language models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2), Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). We first fine-tuned each model on two large-scale datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between human and AI-generated essays. To further enhance the performance, we applied both manual and automated hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Building on these experiments, we developed our BART-CNN model, which incorporates the best-performing BART configuration with an additional convolutional head classifier. Our BART-CNN model achieved impressive Macro F1-scores of 99.78 % and 98.10 % on the Kaggle and Hugging Face datasets, respectively, and demonstrated significant performance gains over baseline methods in cross-domain validation. Our study offers a critical advancement in AI plagiarism detection, helping to uphold academic standards and the assessment quality in an evolving AI landscape.}

In this regard, the article defines market management approach as a holistic framework for managing transformative business operations that emphasizes the integration of emerging technologies with an organization’s operational processes. In this regard, the concept of transformative business operations is introduced and defined as the transformation of organizational systems, resources, and processes using new-age technologies to improve business functions that can generate superior value offerings to all stakeholders. The proposed transformative business operations approach identifies three triggers—the tension of uncertainty, adaptive capabilities, and operational elasticity—that drive the unique and synergistic impacts of these technologies. These triggers result in transformative changes through (a) foundational shifts in organizations, (b) strategy design, execution, and optimization, (c) unified ecosystem creation, and (d) pioneering business operations solutions. The actual transformation is observed in hyper-automation, augmented decision-making, and decentralized supply chains. The article also highlights barriers to adopting these technologies - cultural and workforce adjustments, data security and privacy concerns, and interoperability issues -, which moderate their potential impact, and guide organizations navigating these challenges.

abstract = {Objective
This pilot study explored the effectiveness of a student-led faculty development series by evaluating two key outcomes: the capacity of students to deliver meaningful professional development sessions to faculty and the impact of these sessions on faculty perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (AI).
Methods
In a flipped classroom model, two pharmacy students and 12 faculty members engaged in a semester-long learning series on AI. Each week, students presented on a selected topic followed by discussions that facilitated self-directed learning, including decision-making and project management. Faculty perceptions of AI were evaluated before and after the series using an anonymous survey tool (Technology Acceptance Model Edited to Assess ChatGPT Adoption, TAME-ChatGPT). Respondents created a self-chosen code to link their responses. Additionally, students completed a questionnaire to gauge their reflective thinking after the series.
Results
Faculty participation averaged 7 members per session. Twelve faculty completed the pre-survey, while 8 faculty completed the post-survey. Among those who had used ChatGPT (n = 4 pre [33 %], n = 2 post [25 %]), scores for usefulness increased, while concerns about risks decreased. In contrast, faculty who had not used ChatGPT (n = 8 pre [67 %], n = 6 post [75 %]) reported unchanged or improved scores for ease of use and reduced anxiety. Both students responded positively to the reflective thinking questionnaire.
Conclusion
This pilot study demonstrated that a student-led faculty learning series effectively fostered mutual collaborative learning, benefiting both faculty and students. Pharmacy students, often an underutilized resource, can play a valuable role in faculty development. Colleges of pharmacy may enhance faculty engagement by integrating student-led initiatives into their programs.}

Aging signifies the close to the end of life and threatens health because it features unavoidable compression of body reserve and gradual suppression of organ function. Tremendous research has established twelve essential aging hallmarks that shed light on mitigation frameworks. Interestingly, aging harbors inherent heterogeneity and plasticity, reflecting its multifaceted nature. Additionally, age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, often undergo the exact mechanisms with more devastating damage and speed. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy aging improve life quality and delay the disease’s prevalence to later age. Clinical studies in humans have demonstrated the potential of several interventions, including lifestyle modifications, NAD+ supplementation, gut microbiota modulation, antidiabetic drugs (e.g., metformin), rapamycin, and senolytics, to mitigate the aging process and delay the onset of age-related diseases. Remarkably, clinical trials exhibit heterogeneity by showing substantial inter-individual differences in response to the interventions. It is often attributed to basal health status, tissue senescent burden, and immunity level. Continuous research would validate these correlations and solidify the personalized approaches. Lastly, generative artificial intelligence can pave a promising avenue to revolutionize anti-aging research and tailor aging management to promote healthy aging and extend health span.}

These four pillars are digitalization, structure–property analysis, miniaturization, and automation. We fill gaps in the development of NF membranes and processes by fostering the most promising contemporary technologies, e.g., the integration of process analytical technologies and the development of a parallel artificial nanofiltration permeability assay (PANPA) or large online databases. Moreover, we propose the extensive use of density functional theory-aided structure–property relationship methods to understand solute transport process at a molecular level. Realizing an inverse design would allow researchers and industrial scientists to develop custom membranes for specific applications using optimized properties.}

This manuscript aims to help intensivists prepare themselves and their intensive care units (ICUs) for AI implementation. It provides a comprehensive yet practical roadmap, detailing AI methods, applications, responsible AI principles, common roadblocks and implementation strategies. We propose a three-tiered risk-based approach to AI implementation, starting with low-risk low-complexity administrative AI, progressing to logistical AI, and finally integrating medical AI as clinical decision support systems. This ensures a gradual build-up of AI skills, technical AI readiness of the ICU, incremental value demonstration and alignment with evolving regulatory standards. For each AI project, responsible AI principles should be incorporated and adequately addressed throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from development to validation to implementation and scaling. Common roadblocks for AI implementation including technical issues (such as data quality and interoperability issues), organizational challenges (such as lack of a clear vision and strategy), and clinical concerns (such as limited AI literacy among staff), should be addressed proactively. By following this roadmap, ICUs can achieve sustainable AI integration, ultimately improving patient outcomes and clinician experience. The future of critical care lies in the responsible and strategic adoption of AI, with intensivists playing a central role in shaping its implementation.}

Assurance case patterns serve as templates derived from previous successful assurance cases, aimed at facilitating the creation of new assurance cases. Despite using these patterns to generate assurance cases, their instantiation remains a largely manual and error-prone process that heavily relies on domain expertise. Thus, exploring techniques to support their automatic instantiation becomes crucial. This study aims to investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the generation of assurance cases that comply with specific patterns. Specifically, we formalize assurance case patterns using predicate-based rules and then utilize LLMs, i.e., GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo, to automatically instantiate assurance cases from these formalized patterns. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate assurance cases that comply with the given patterns. However, this study also highlights that LLMs may struggle with understanding some nuances related to pattern-specific relationships. While LLMs exhibit potential in the automatic generation of assurance cases, their capabilities still fall short compared to human experts. Therefore, a semi-automatic approach to instantiating assurance cases may be more practical at this time.}

While existing research addresses these challenges separately, no work has tackled both language prior and compositional reasoning simultaneously. This paper presents three key contributions: the development of a dataset specifically designed to address language prior and compositional reasoning issues, the creation of a unified model capable of addressing both problems in a single inference, and the ability to generate answers beyond a predefined answer space. Our proposed model, R-VQA, demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across various VQA datasets.}

abstract = {The building sector is a significant energy consumer, making building energy optimization crucial for reducing energy demand. Automating energy optimization tasks eases the workload on engineers and hastens energy savings. More than 85% of building data is unstructured and diverse, concealing energy insights that demand laborious extraction. We propose an LLM-based multi-agent framework to explore automated tasks using these data. The framework includes three stages: building information processing, performance diagnosis, and retrofit recommendation, where LLMs injected with domain expertise act as agents for the roles of planner, researcher and advisor. We develop knowledge databases with retriever tools to inject knowledge and validate through experiments. In case studies, our framework delivered reliable results with only $5.15, effectively handling diverse inputs and tasks across cases. This demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce repetitive human labor and costs. We also discuss the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as trustworthy, generalized automated task solvers.}

These tools have the potential and capability to transform the business world in various aspects. However, serval service organisations are facing many challenges while adopting the GAI tools in their organisations. In a similar context, this study explores the adoption of GAI barriers through two studies by a mixed-method approach. The first study is based on YouTube datasets of selected videos where GAI adoption challenges, problems, and barriers were discussed. Further, these YouTube datasets were analysed through text mining and empirical modelling techniques. In the second study, an extensive literature review was done and critical barriers to GAI adoption were identified based on the extensive literature review. Further, these barriers were analysed through three theoretical lenses and a hybrid fuzzy multicriteria decision-making approach. In addition, the results from the first study were further matched and verified with our second study. This establishes the relevance of adopting a mixed-method approach. Our major findings are: (i) trust, anticipation, and surprise emerged as the strongest emotions of the viewers who posted their comments on the YouTube videos; (ii) Five major barriers are revealed through topic analysis of YouTube transcripts and these are ethical, technological, regulations & policies, cost, and human resources; (iii) Six major barriers are identified through second study are privacy & security, return on investment, running cost, misuse, over-reliance, and Lack of digital infrastructure.}

This study examines the development, implementation, and evaluation of a teamwork framework by using academic integrity standards and formative feedback to minimise the use of generative AI tools in the Business Project Management (BPM) unit and promote students' learning skills through teamwork and self/peer evaluation. This teamwork assessment was designed to transform students into independent learners by improving their cultural awareness, self-confidence, teamwork, communication, leadership, as well as personal and interpersonal skills. The study's objectives are to determine whether a teamwork framework can help to maintain academic integrity and transform BPM students into independent learners and leaders in the era of generative AI, and to determine whether lecturers' formative feedback enhances students' skills in teamwork assessment. This research comprises an empirical study of 408 local and international BPM students from different cultural backgrounds. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data and achieve a broader perspective of the research topic. BPM students reported their satisfaction with this type of assessment since it helped them acquire skills such as intercultural effectiveness and teamwork. Following the implementation of the teamwork framework, the number of instances of academic misconduct and requests for extensions have decreased dramatically, while the assessment's average marks increased by 10 %. A set of recommendations is offered that will ensure the successful implementation of the proposed framework for teamwork assessment and self/peer evaluation. This study was limited to the Business Project Management unit, but in 2024, the same study will be conducted involving other postgraduate units at Curtin University with a future rollout in other universities to compare how students perceive teamwork assessment.}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) agentic workflow have facilitated complex engineering processes, their application in BEM has not been specifically explored. This paper investigates the feasibility of automating BEM using LLM agentic workflow. We developed a generic LLM-planning-based workflow that takes a building description as input and generates an error-free EnergyPlus building energy model. Our robust workflow includes four core agents: 1) Building Description Pre-Processing, 2) IDF Object Information Extraction, 3) Single IDF Object Generator Suite, and 4) IDF Debugging Agent. These agents divide the complex tasks into manageable sub-steps, enabling LLMs to generate accurate and reliable results at each stage. The case study demonstrates the successful translation of a building description into an error-free EnergyPlus model for the iUnit modular building at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The effectiveness of our workflow surpasses: 1) naive prompt engineering, 2) other LLM-based workflows, and 3) manual modeling, in terms of accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency. The paper concludes with a discussion on the interplay between foundational models and LLM agent planning design, advocating for the use of fine-tuned, specialized models to advance this field.}

Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), holds significant promise for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR). However, standardized reporting guidance for LLM-assisted research is lacking. This article introduces the ELEVATE-GenAI framework and checklist—reporting guidelines specifically designed for HEOR studies involving LLMs.
Methods
The framework was developed through a targeted literature review of existing reporting guidelines, AI evaluation frameworks, and expert input from the ISPOR Working Group on Generative AI. It comprises 10 domains—including model characteristics, accuracy, reproducibility, and fairness and bias. The accompanying checklist translates the framework into actionable reporting items. To illustrate its use, the framework was applied to 2 published HEOR studies: one focused on a systematic literature review tasks and the other on economic modeling.
Results
The ELEVATE-GenAI framework offers a comprehensive structure for reporting LLM-assisted HEOR research, while the checklist facilitates practical implementation. Its application to the 2 case studies demonstrates its relevance and usability across different HEOR contexts.
Conclusions
Although the framework provides robust reporting guidance, further empirical testing is needed to assess its validity, completeness, usability, and generalizability across diverse HEOR use cases. The ELEVATE-GenAI framework and checklist address a critical gap by offering structured guidance for transparent, accurate, and reproducible reporting of LLM-assisted HEOR research. Future work will focus on extensive testing and validation to support broader adoption and refinement.}

abstract = {Context:
Early-stage software startups, despite their strong innovative potential, experience high failure rates due to factors such as inexperience, limited resources, and market uncertainty. Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising support opportunities; however, effective strategies for their integration into startup practices remain underexplored.
Objective:
This study investigates how prompt engineering and system instruction design can enhance the utility of LLMs in addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by early-stage software startups.
Methods:
A Design Science Research (DSR) methodology was adopted, structured into three iterative cycles. In the first cycle, use cases for LLM adoption within the startup context were identified. The second cycle experimented with various prompt patterns to optimize LLM responses for the defined use cases. The third cycle developed “StartupGPT”, an LLM-based assistant tailored for startups, exploring system instruction designs. The solution was evaluated with 25 startup practitioners through a combination of qualitative feedback and quantitative metrics.
Results:
The findings show that tailored prompt patterns and system instructions significantly enhance user perceptions of LLM support in real-world startup scenarios. StartupGPT received strong evaluation scores across key dimensions: satisfaction (93.33%), effectiveness (80%), efficiency (80%), and reliability (86.67%). Nonetheless, areas for improvement were identified, particularly in context retention, personalization of suggestions, communication tone, and sourcing external references.
Conclusion:
This study empirically validates the applicability of LLMs in early-stage software startups. It offers actionable guidelines for prompt and system instruction design and contributes both theoretical insights and a practical artifact — StartupGPT — that supports startup operations without necessitating costly LLM retraining.}

abstract = {The real-time road surface friction coefficient (RSFC) is a critical parameter for evaluating skid resistance and making safe driving decisions in driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles, especially under adverse weather conditions. RSFC estimation depends on the interaction between the road surface and tires. However, accurate estimation is challenging due to varying road environments and sensor errors that can cause significant distortions. To obtain high-accuracy RSFC, this study proposes a novel real-time RSFC detection method that integrates a diffusion model with the Transformer-in-Transformer(TNT) model to detect RSFC from vehicle video pictures. The method consists of three steps. First, we created labeled friction coefficient image datasets representing asphalt concrete surfaces under four moisture conditions. Second, we used a diffusion model to enhance the dataset, increasing sample diversity. Finally, we trained a TNT model on the extended dataset to recognize friction coefficients. The approach was tested across various datasets and compared to four state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves accuracy, achieving a 22.89% increase compared to the unenhanced dataset and a 5.59% improvement over SOTA methods. The primary contribution of this study is the integration of generative artificial intelligence and computer vision algorithms to enhance RSFC recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the recognition method meets the real-time performance requirements, processing frames in just two milliseconds. This method can be an effective tool for perceiving road surface environmental parameters and holds significant value in improving driving safety under adverse weather conditions.}

The results indicated that the chatbot intervention significantly reduced the participants' FLRA within the experimental group when comparing pre- and post-test scores. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups after the treatment, either in FLRA or FLRP. The qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews suggested that the chatbot provided technological, pedagogical, linguistic, and affective affordances to assist reading.

Nutrient composition differences across AI tools were statistically assessed using SPSS 24.0 (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Results showed significant variations between AI outputs, with energy values ranging from 1357 kcal to 2273 kcal and protein intake varying by up to 65 g across models. Notable inconsistencies were also found in micronutrients such as calcium, iron, and vitamin D. AI models often failed to meet targeted caloric levels and showed inconsistent adherence to diet-specific nutrient profiles.

Using a mixed-method design, we developed a privacy risk identification framework based on evidence from China. According to the results of qualitative interviews, the privacy risk identification framework mainly includes five risk dimensions: data risk, institutional risk, technical risk, structural risk, and behavioral risk. We identified 17 risk factors under these five dimensions. We further developed the measurement items for each risk factor and verified the indicator framework through quantitative methods. Our research provides a theoretical basis for identifying the privacy risks in OGD, supporting governments in discovering and dealing with them accordingly.

abstract = {Deep learning has demonstrated considerable success in agricultural applications. However, its conventional implementations heavily depend on large-scale labelled datasets—a requirement that is often impractical in agriculture due to data scarcity, high annotation costs, or environmental variability. While insufficient training data can significantly limit the performance of standard deep learning models, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, enabling robust model training with minimal labelled samples by utilising limited data for training instead. Despite its potential, a critical review assessing how FSL addresses expert system challenges in agriculture remains notably absent. This paper attempts to fill this void by presenting an updated comprehensive review of FSL's applications in agriculture. We categorise FSL methodologies into two primary approaches: data processing-driven and model learning-driven. Data processing–driven approaches address data scarcity by enriching representational diversity through synthetic samples generated with models such as generative adversarial networks, or by transferring knowledge from related domains to improve generalisation. In contrast, model learning–driven strategies confront the same challenge through specialised architectures and optimisation techniques that enable effective generalisation from limited samples. Within this taxonomy, data processing–driven paradigms include transfer learning and generative artificial intelligence, while model learning–driven paradigms cover metric learning methods such as Siamese or prototypical networks, together with model-based and optimisation approaches designed for efficient generalisation. Our analysis pinpoints cutting-edge technologies within each sector, shedding light on overlooked areas and opportunities where FSL can harness limited data to yield promising outcomes when used to solve problems in agriculture.}
