We reviewed emerging domains in which EHR metadata may be used to measure health care delivery, outlining a framework for evaluating measures based on desirability, feasibility, and viability. We argue that EHR use metadata may be leveraged to develop and operationalize novel measures in the domains of team structure and dynamics, workflows, and cognitive environment to provide a clearer understanding of modern health care delivery. Examples of measures feasible using metadata include quantification of teamwork and collaboration, patient continuity measures, workflow conformity measures, and attention switching. By enabling measures that can be used to inform the next generation of health care delivery, EHR metadata may be used to improve the quality of patient care and support clinician well-being. Careful attention is needed to ensure that these measures are desirable, feasible, and viable.}

MVRs are a method of data elicitation, in which participants are asked to illustrate something (either in print or digitally) as a means of visualizing a process, an idea, and/or their current knowledge state on a given topic. Participants are then typically asked to describe what their visualization represents, including all parts of their illustration. Although MVRs have been used in a handful of L2 writing studies, their full potential has yet to be realized. Thus, this paper advocates for their use in future studies. The paper opens with a review of the concept of multimodality and its place within contemporary applied linguistics scholarship. Next, discussed is the theoretical support behind leveraging MVRs. Example studies are then outlined, showcasing how MVRs have been leveraged by previous researchers when investigating different phenomena (e.g., L2 learners’ genre awareness, identities, ideologies, and issues involving language testing). The article closes with a discussion of future research directions covering how L2 writing scholars might adopt MVRs in future studies.}

abstract = {Dependency-driven relation extraction (DDRE) intends to improve the classification performance by exploring the syntax information contained in dependency tree. Although recent works have made impressive advances, they usually suffer severe challenges of losing sequential semantics information due to the pruning strategy. In addition, task-irrelevant information in representations such as noise or entity appositive information might be dominant in the procedure of representation learning, which interferes with the final performance of relation classification. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-view syntax-semantics information bottleneck (MS2IB) model, which aims at exploring supplementary information from a newly incorporated view and captures minimum sufficient information for the DDRE task. Specifically, MS2IB treats the DDRE task as a multi-view information learning procedure, where the sequential semantics information is supplemented under the guidance of representation learning with multiple views. Meanwhile, the minimum sufficient task-relevant information is extracted from the aspect of information compression and information preservation simultaneously. Finally, we formulate the objective of MS2IB as an information loss function based on the measurement of mutual information, where a new variational approach is presented to ensure its local optimum. Experiments on benchmark datasets and self-constructed dataset are conducted to show the superiority of MS2IB over the state-of-the-art models. For example, the proposed MS2IB achieves 91.42 % Precision, 89.21 % Recall and 90.28 % F1-score on the SemEval-2010 dataset. The MS2IB model further demonstrates strong generalization on domain datasets and robust performance on large-scale and noisy dataset. With the promising performance on both universal and domain datasets, the proposed model can be applied into various practical applications, such as information extraction and inference of transportation incidents/accidents.}

As a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, radiology reports are immediately released to patients. We determine if readers of radiology reports, via electronic health records (EHRs), and radiology report complexity have changed post the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act.
Methods
A retrospective observational study was used to analyze 10,000 radiology reports (equal split of CT, mammogram, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound modalities) per year between 2013 and 2023. Readability was calculated through reading grade level indices.
Results
Patient viewership of their radiology reports via EHRs increased from 3.3 % (95 % CI: 3.0 %–3.7 %) in 2013 to 58.2 % (95 % CI: 57.3 %–59.2 %) in 2023. Once the 21st Century Cures Act's Information Blocking Provision went into effect, there was a significant increase in viewing probability with patients having 1.71 times higher odds of viewing their reports (OR = 1.71, 95 % CI: 1.27–2.32, p < 0.001). This increase in patient viewership held for all modalities tested except CT (P < 0.01). Despite increased viewership, the reading grade level of radiologist dictated radiology reports was greater than the recommended level for health information across all years and modalities tested.
Conclusions and relevance
Patients are increasingly engaging with their radiology reports, but reports may be too complex for the typical patient. Solutions will be required to improve patient experience with their radiology reports.}

Gastrostomy tube hypertrophic granulation tissue development, prolapse, and leakage are common problems that are often treated with tube re-siting. Wedge gastrostomy tube site resection is a revision technique used to enable continued use of the original tube site while removing affected tissue. The aim of this study was to describe this technique and outcomes in a series of patients requiring this intervention. The wedge gastrostomy tube site resection involves wedge excision of hypergranulation tissue or prolapsed gastric tissue and primary closure of the remaining defect. We reviewed outcomes for two children who underwent wedge gastrostomy tube site resection for medically refractory hypergranulation tissue.
Case presentation
Two patients presented with hypertrophic granulation tissue at their gastrostomy tube sites. In Case 1, the patient underwent two revisions spaced two years apart and has been symptom-free for 9 months. In Case 2, the patient required a single revision and has been symptom-free for 13 months. Neither patient had complications related to their gastrostomy tube site revision in the immediate postoperative period.
Conclusion
Wedge gastrostomy tube site resection is a useful strategy to remove reactive tissue that contributes to leakage around a gastrostomy tube and avoids the morbidities of tube re-siting.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment. Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.
Objective
This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.
Methods
We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.
Results
Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.
Conclusions
Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.}

We are currently developing a cell classification system intended for routine histopathology. During observation, cells of interest are added to a deep learning (DL) network, which after training classifies the remaining cells of interest with high and immediately validatable accuracy. In this study, we identify the optimal histological microsection thickness for this process and describe in high detail the morphological differences introduced by variation in microsection thickness.
Method
From HE-stained digitized sections of liver cut manually at 5 thicknesses and on an automated microtome (DS), hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were manually annotated and loaded into a DL convolutional neural network (ResNet). The network was trained at different settings to identify the thickness with optimal relation between number of training cells and validation accuracy. To shed interpretable light on the impact of thickness, exhaustive morphological details of the annotated cells were quantified and the differences between hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were analyzed with random forest.
Results
Classifying hepatocytes from DS sections clearly resulted in highest validation accuracy with least number of cells and for the remaining thicknesses a trend towards thin sections being more efficient was observed. Random forest analysis generally identified variations in nuclear granularity as the most important features in distinguishing cells. In DS and the thinner tissue sections, nuclear granularity features were more distinguished.
Conclusion
Microsections cut with DS in particular and thin sections in general are better suited for the intended cell classification system.}

Consumer search behavior is a key topic in marketing, economics, and psychology. Across fields, distinct research traditions have emerged, each with its own foundational assumptions and data requirements. Some of these differences stem from conflicting assumptions (e.g., search is Bayesian optimal vs heuristic) while others arise from contextual factors (e.g., search in a visual space vs search in memory). This article proposes an agenda for comparing and extending models of consumer search to support practitioners and researchers in selecting, applying, and refining these models. Ultimately, this may contribute to a more integrated understanding of consumer search. We review five prominent theoretical models, each with distinct terminologies. For each model, we review its background, aims, core assumptions, and provide illustrative examples. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we initiate a synthesis aimed at resolving terminological differences and propose an agenda for model comparison, extension, and integration; and (2) we identify opportunities for future research to advance a more comprehensive understanding of consumer search and choice.}

This study assessed the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) colonization in rectal swabs from haematological patients with malignancies undergoing routine surveillance and explored the relationship between MDR-GNB colonization and subsequent development of bloodstream infections (BSIs).
Methods
Between January 2020 and September 2022, all patients admitted to our haematology ward underwent weekly MDR-GNB colonization screening via rectal swabs. A retrospective analysis was performed. MDR-GNB were defined per 2022 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases criteria: (a) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCephRE), (b) carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), (c) Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR), and (d) carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
Results
Among 3024 rectal swabs from 699 patients, 503 of 3024 (16.6%) tested positive for MDR-GNB in 192 of 699 patients (27.5%). The most prevalent organisms were Escherichia coli (248/503; 49.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae complex (125/503; 24.9%), and P. aeruginosa (36/503; 7.2%). A total of 59 of 503 (11.7%) colonizations of CRE were identified. Overall, 27 of 192 (14.1%) patients were colonized at admission, primarily by 3GCephRE (27/29; 93.1%). Colonization with CRE and DTR P. aeruginosa was more frequently documented after several days of hospitalization. BSI occurred in 74 of 192 (38.5%) colonized and 61 of 507 (12.0%) non-colonized patients. MDR-GNB caused 57 of 166 BSIs episodes, 50 of 57 (87.7%) of which were in colonized patients. The unadjusted concordance rate between rectal swab isolates and blood cultures was observed in 43 of 90 BSIs (47.8%) occurring in colonized patients, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 36.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.9% for DTR P. aeruginosa; a PPV of 25.0% and an NPV of 99.9% for CRE; and a PPV of 14.6% and an NPV of 99.0% for 3GCephRE.
Discussion
Routine weekly surveillance for MDR-GNB in haematological patients enables early identification of colonization, often preceding MDR-GNB BSIs. Further studies using adjusted analyses are needed to establish its independent predictive value.}

The dot blot test evaluated against serological gold-standard enzyme-linked immunotransfer blot (EITB) assay, demonstrated preliminary laboratory sensitivity (89 %, 95 % CI: 68.6–97.1) and specificity (100 %, 95 % CI: 97.6 - 100), highlighting its potential as a reliable alternative diagnostic method. Cost-effectiveness and minimal laboratory requirements make it particularly suited for field use in resource-limited settings.}

During periods of apparent stability, proactive efforts to advance infodemiology are essential for enhancing preparedness and improving public health outcomes. This requires a thorough examination of the foundations of this evolving discipline, particularly in understanding how to accurately identify an infodemic at the appropriate time and scale, and how to distinguish it from other processes of viral information spread, both within and outside the realm of public health. In this paper, we integrate expertise from data science and public health to examine the key differences between information production during an infodemic and viral information spread. We explore both clear and subtle distinctions, including context and contingency (ie, the association of an infodemic and viral information spread with a health crisis); information dynamics in terms of volume, spread, and predictability; the role of misinformation and information voids; societal impact; and mitigation strategies. By analyzing these differences, we highlight challenges and open questions. These include whether an infodemic is solely associated with pandemics or whether it could arise from other health emergencies; if infodemics are limited to health-related issues or if they could emerge from crises initially unrelated to health (like climate events); and whether infodemics are exclusively global phenomena or if they can occur on national or local scales. Finally, we propose directions for future quantitative research to help the scientific community more robustly differentiate between these phenomena and develop tailored management strategies.}

abstract = {Purpose
Successful total knee arthroplasty (TKA) relies on proper ligament balancing with a focus on medial stability. Intra-operative evaluation of the medial flexion gap must account for the relative femur–tibia positioning after implant placement. This study investigated whether intra-operative fine-tuning of the medial gap, enabled by a simple, reproducible spacer block for precise flexion gap measurement, could achieve consistent medial gap matching in both extension and flexion.
Methods
Forty-seven patients (9 men, 38 women) with knee osteoarthritis underwent JOURNEY II bicruciate stabilized TKA. A spacer block simulating post-cam engagement was designed to accurately assess the medial flexion gap. Intra-operative fine-tuning of the medial flexion gap was performed using spacer blocks and a stepless femoral cutting guide. Gaps were measured during the component trial using a tension device and at 1 year post-operatively via stress radiographs.
Results
Initially, 29% of knees exhibited a flexion–extension gap difference ≥2 ​mm after posterior cruciate ligament resection and tibial osteotomy. Spacer block fine-tuning reduced this to 8% and this improvement persisted at 1 year. At 4 years follow-up, Knee Society Scores were favorable, with significant gains in extension and flexion angles.
Conclusion
The developed spacer block technique, which replicates the post-cam engaging position, provided consistent and accurate flexion gap measurements and reduced flexion–extension discrepancies. This approach enhanced knee stability and patient outcome post-TKA.}

Case report
This case illustrates an adolescent male with a history of Chiari 1 malformation who presented to EMS with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). An unusual rhythm response was experienced during electrical cardioversion, where this intervention resulted in an immediate doubling of his heart rate.

abstract = {Background
Chronic meningococcal disease is a rare and under-recognized manifestation of Neisseria meningitidis infection. Unlike acute meningococcal infections, its presentation is insidious, leading to diagnostic delays. We conducted a systematic review to better characterize its clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological profile.
Methods
A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024608035). We searched Excerpta Medica, National Library of Medicine, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and bibliographies for cases reported since 1960 using the terms “chronic meningococcemia” or “chronic meningococcal disease.” Eligible cases involved previously apparently healthy individuals with N. meningitidis isolated from a normally sterile site. Two reviewers independently extracted data on demographics, clinical features, diagnostics, microbiology, treatment, and outcomes.
Results
A total of 126 cases from 97 reports were included. Most patients (median age: 21 years) presented with recurrent fever (98 %), non-blanching skin lesions (95 %), and musculoskeletal symptoms (90 %) over a period of ≥ 10 days. In over two-thirds of cases, symptoms followed a relapsing-remitting pattern, with alternating episodes of fever, rash, and joint involvement. Diagnosis was delayed longer in adults than in children (P < 0.0001). Blood cultures were positive in 77 % of cases; molecular testing and skin biopsy improved diagnostic yield. N. meningitidis serogroup B (58 %) and C (31 %) were most common. Meningeal signs were largely absent (94 %). Antimicrobial therapy led to complete recovery without sequelae in all patients. Testing for inherited susceptibility was conducted in 52 cases and revealed abnormalities - primarily complement deficiencies - in 13 (23 %) of them.
Conclusions
Chronic meningococcal disease should be considered in individuals with relapsing fever, vasculitic skin lesions, and joint involvement, especially when cultures are negative or symptoms mimic viral or autoimmune conditions. Early use of molecular diagnostics and awareness of characteristic patterns may improve recognition. The term "relapsing-remitting meningococcal disease" may better reflect its clinical nature.}

abstract = {Objective
Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is advisable to promote better prognosis. The Mini-TEA scale was conceived as a sensitive screening for ASD among children. The authors aimed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the scale in a wider population.
Method
279 children from 2.5 to 12 yo were recruited, most of them under evaluation for possible ASD in the APAE of Passo Fundo/RS, as well as children with other diagnoses and normal children. Their parents/relatives answered the 48 binary questions (yes/no) of the Mini-TEA scale, divided into 15 items, which resulted in a score from 0 to 15. After that, the children were evaluated regarding the diagnostic criteria of ASD by experienced raters (gold standard) who had previously submitted to a concordance test and remained unaware of the children’s scores. Sensitivity and specificity Figs. were obtained. Factor analysis and Item Response Theory approaches were used for validity evidence.
Results
115 children were diagnosed with ASD. Scores ≥9 had 98.3 % of sensitivity and 62.2 % of specificity for the diagnosis. Two cases with the typical presentation of Asperger’s syndrome scored lower than 9. The mean time for screening was about 8.5 min. The validation model presented excellent coefficients of factorability. The analysis showed that the total variance of the scores of the scale through the 15 items was explained only by the set of ASD symptoms (unidimensionality).
Conclusion
The Mini-TEA scale is a very sensitive tool to screen for ASD and has high internal consistency for assessing typical autistic symptoms.}

The risk of drug interactions in patients with HTN is aggravated when prescribing treatments for additional acute pathologies. This can favor adverse reactions to medications or make it difficult to control blood pressure during their stay in the emergency room.
Objective
Identify and classify, using CDSS, the IFFs between the antihypertensive treatment regimen and the drugs prescribed in the emergency department.
Material and methods
Fifty-three patients with systemic arterial hypertension were treated in the emergency department. Clinical decision support systems are used to identify and classify potential FFs.
Results
IFFs were found in 96.2% of hypertensive patients in the emergency department. Those with the highest frequency were of moderate risk. The most frequent mechanism was pharmacodynamic, mainly synergistic by ad-dition.
Conclusions
The correlation index between the number of drugs prescribed in the emer-gency room and the presence of IFF shows the need to carry out a scrutiny of the joint pharmaco-logical behavior used in hypertensive patients who attend emergency medical care to rationalize the use of medications reducing the probability of presenting IFF.
Résumé
Le risque d’interactions médicamenteuses chez les patients hypertendus est aggravé lors de la prescription de traitements pour des pathologies aiguës supplémentaires. Cela peut favoriser les réactions indésirables aux médicaments ou rendre difficile le contrôle de la pression artérielle pendant leur séjour au service des urgences.
Objectif
Identifier et classifier, à l’aide du système d’aide à la décision clinique (CDSS), les IFF entre le schéma de traitement antihypertenseur et les médicaments prescrits au service des urgences.
Matériels et méthodes
Cinquante-trois patients souffrant d’hypertension artérielle systémique ont été traités au service des urgences. Les systèmes d’aide à la décision clinique sont utilisés pour identifier et classifier les IFF potentiels.
Résultats
Des IFF ont été trouvées chez 96,2 % des patients hypertendus au service des urgences. Ceux de fréquence la plus élevée étaient de risque modéré. Le mécanisme le plus fréquent était pharmacodynamique, principalement synergique par addition.
Conclusion
L’indice de corrélation entre le nombre de médicaments prescrits au service des urgences et la présence d’IFF montre la nécessité d’effectuer un examen du comportement pharmacologique conjoint utilisé chez les patients hypertendus qui se présentent aux soins médicaux d’urgence pour rationaliser l’utilisation des médicaments et réduire la probabilité de présenter des IFF.}

This has created the need for transformative change in the agricultural sector, with soil health playing a key role in this transition. Soil health is essential for agricultural productivity, economic viability, and ecosystem resilience, while also advancing sustainability and inclusivity. Achieving these outcomes depends on effective soil management, but slow growth in fertilizer use and limited understanding of its efficiency by farmers pose significant challenges. The Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit (Nairobi, May 2024) underscored the urgency of these challenges, endorsing the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan. This commentary outlines key considerations for successful implementation of the plan, highlighting enabling conditions and strategic approaches: (1) trusted multi-sectoral partnerships fostering collaboration among farmers, governments, private companies, non-governmental organisations, and donors, (2) demand-driven research and development with strong focus on measurable development outcomes, (3) targeted investments and finance effectively expanding the role of the private sector, (4) effective policy mandates relying on comprehensive policy mixes, and (5) inclusive capacity-building using gender-transformative approaches. These strategic contributions are essential to achieving sustainable, equitable agricultural transformation in Africa. The transformation will demand innovation, long-term commitment, and coordinated action across sectors to ensure impact beyond the timeframe of the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan.}

The incidence of early-stage diagnoses is increasing, largely driven by the implementation of low dose computed tomography screening programs. Surgery has long been considered the standard of care for these tumours, offering excellent oncologic outcomes and allowing essential pathological staging. However, surgery may be indicated or poorly tolerated in certain populations, particularly elderly or medically inoperable patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy has emerged as a non-invasive alternative with high local control rates and reduced early morbidity. This raises a critical question: should all patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer be managed surgically, or is there a role for treatment individualization? Current evidence highlights the need of balancing curative intent with treatment-related risks. Several clinical trials are currently evaluating stereotactic body radiotherapy in operable patients, aiming to identify subsets that may derive benefit from a non-surgical approach. This review advocates for a personalized, patient-centred treatment strategy, integrating tumour characteristics, operability, comorbidities, and patient preference.
Résumé
Le cancer bronchique non à petites cellules de stade T1N0 représente environ 20 % des cancers du poumon et correspond à des tumeurs de taille inférieure ou égale à 3cm sans atteinte ganglionnaire ni métastase à distance. La fréquence des diagnostics à un stade précoce est en augmentation grâce à la généralisation du dépistage par scanographie thoracique. Traditionnellement, la chirurgie constitue le traitement de référence, offrant des taux de guérison élevés ainsi qu’un accès indispensable au bilan histopathologique complet. Toutefois, elle n’est pas toujours indiquée, notamment chez les patients âgés ou fragiles. La radiothérapie en conditions stéréotaxiques s’est imposée comme une alternative, avec des taux de contrôle local élevés et une morbidité aiguë moindre. Cette évolution soulève une question essentielle : tous les patients doivent-ils être opérés, ou un traitement personnalisé est-il envisageable ? Les données actuelles soulignent la nécessité de concilier l’intention curative avec le risque de morbidité. Plusieurs essais cliniques explorent actuellement l’utilisation de la radiothérapie en conditions stéréotaxiques chez des patients opérables, dans le but d’identifier des sous-groupes susceptibles d’en tirer bénéfice.

abstract = {Objective
Acquired anterior glottic webs are the result of trauma, iatrogenic, radiation, or inflammation to the anterior commissure, resulting in narrowing of the airway and elevated pitch. They are very challenging to treat, and contemporary management strategies typically involve repeat procedures under general anesthesia with high rates of web recurrence. We aim to describe a novel treatment for anterior glottic webs with potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser treatment that are performed in-office under topical anesthesia.
Methods
This is a retrospective chart review of six patients with an anterior glottic web who were managed in an office setting with KTP laser between the years 2019 and 2023. Demographic data, patient reported outcome measures, and treatment details were collected. Preprocedure and postprocedure video laryngoscopy was collected, and representative images were evaluated by blinded laryngologists. The reviewer, blinded to treatment status, was asked to measure the length of the vocal fold from vocal process to current anterior commissure and in addition, measure vocal process to expected ideal anterior commissure. The percentage change in length of the anterior glottic web is then calculated and reported.
Results
Six patients were included in the study, all tolerated the procedure well, and no adverse events. Patient follow up was on average 7 months (5 weeks to 3.1 years), with three of six patients having approximately 3 years follow up. All patients had a reduction in the length of the anterior glottic web, with an average pretreatment web length 40.4%, falling to 15.4% postKTP; t(6) = 3.43, 95%CI [6.29-43.71], P < 0.05. There were no significant change in VHI-10 scores post treatment t(3) = 1.73, 95% CI [−2.93−9.93].
Conclusions
KTP is a novel in-office treatment that offers promising and potentially durable results in the management of anterior glottic web.

abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (IVR) has been successfully applied in various areas of psychology and learning. IVR has also been adapted for empathy training, but previous studies failed to consider various empathy types. We aimed to provide learners with personalized recommendations of empathy training content for different empathy types. Consequently, we presented Robot’s Dream, an IVR game suite providing personalized content based on the learner’s empathy type. We then conducted a mixed-method evaluation with 35 fifth and sixth-grade students who played Robot’s Dream and answered a post-test questionnaire on usability, user experience, and impact. The user study results demonstrated adequate usability and user experience with emotional engagement of the participants. However, the participants gave mixed reactions to realism and discomfort with the IVR hardware. The results also showed high perceived potential for empathy training and raising awareness of empathy. By retrospectively analyzing the development process and the user study results, we presented learned lessons and identified aspects in Robot’s Dream for future improvement. The presented development account of Robot’s Dream and the user study results can be helpful for educators, researchers, and developers interested in personalizing empathy training and other psychological training with IVR games.}

abstract = {Introduction and importance
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an extremely rare sarcoma mainly reported in the lung. The adrenal gland, however, is an extremely rare site of occurrence. Herein, we report a case of a large adrenal mass with no contributory imaging features presenting a challenging pathological diagnosis.
Case presentation
A healthy 32-year-old male patient, with no personal nor family history, presented with loss of body weight and condition developing for two months. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities with a soft and depressible abdomen and absence of palpable lump. Circulating Chromogranin A and catecholamine metabolites were within normal range. The preoperative imaging features were noncontributory. The pathological examination on biopsy specimen concluded to a spindle cell proliferation set in a chronically inflamed background suggesting the diagnosis of IMT. The patient, subsequently, underwent radical nephrectomy unveiling a 25 cm adrenal mass. Pathological findings on resection specimen confirmed the diagnosis of IMT of the left adrenal gland.
Clinical discussion
Due to their rarity in the adrenal gland and their noncontributory radiological features, IMTs are typically not considered as a potential diagnosis in this location. As a result, this condition is often underdiagnosed. In this setting, suspicion for IMT should be raised when spindle cell histology is observed.
Conclusion
It is fundamental for practicians to keep this entity in mind as the treatment consists of complete tumor extirpation. The latter being the only guarantee of recurrence free follow up.}

Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming musculoskeletal research, offering new approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and patient management in osteoarthritis (OA). However, implementation and ethical challenges persist. This manuscript summarizes insights from the OARSI 2025 Pre-Congress Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in Osteoarthritis Research, highlighting opportunities and challenges in applying AI across biomechanics, imaging, and clinical research domains.
Design
The workshop, organized by the OARSI Early Career Investigator Committee and co-chaired by Drs. Matthew Harkey and Brooke Patterson, convened experts to discuss the use of AI in real-world biomechanics data collection, radiomics for imaging-based biomarkers, and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and research applications. Emphasis was placed on the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical oversight.
Results
In biomechanics, AI-driven markerless motion capture and wearable sensors enable scalable, ecologically valid data collection, though issues such as class imbalance, data privacy, and model interpretability remain. In imaging, radiomics and deep learning models show promise for early OA detection and progression prediction but face challenges in domain adaptation and external validation. In clinical research, LLMs can streamline documentation and thematic analysis but must address concerns around bias, data security, and transparency. Across domains, transparency, reproducibility, and ethical use of AI were emphasized as critical for maintaining scientific rigor.
Conclusions
Cross-disciplinary collaboration and AI literacy are essential to responsibly advance AI integration in OA research. The workshop’s collective insights call for ethical, patient-centered approaches that leverage AI’s strengths while preserving research integrity and trust.}

abstract = {With the rise of ChatGPT, the anthropomorphic dialogue form of chatbots is sought after and relied on by a large number of users. Compared with traditional social real objects, chatbots are more controllable in social relationships. At the same time, compared with traditional real social objects, chatbots may show better emotional identification with objects. The structural equation modeling is a path analysis method based on the factor analysis and linear regression, which can be used to analyze the path relationship between intricate variables. Based on the structural equation modeling, this paper analyzes the potential pathways for artificial intelligence chatbots to induce the user's emotional dependence. The results show that the “sense of identification” and “sense of control” will cause people to have emotional dependence on the artificial intelligence chatbots, with p < 0.05. However, the psychological distance plays a regulating role in the identification-emotional dependence and the sense of control-emotional dependence, respectively. The research results in this paper show that there is a certain theoretical basis for the chatting intelligent robots to transform from a tool role to a social and emotional role.}

abstract = {Mural sketches reveal both the content and structure of the murals and are crucial for the preservation of murals. However, existing methods lack robustness, making it difficult to suppress noise while preserving sketches on damaged murals and fully capturing details on clear murals. To address this, we propose a Data Uncertainty-Driven Robust Network (DURN) for mural sketch detection. DURN uses uncertainty to quantify noise in the murals, converting prediction into a learnable normal distribution, where the mean represents the sketch and the variance denotes the uncertainty. This enables the model to learn both the sketch and the noise simultaneously, achieving noise suppression while preserving the sketches. To enhance sketches, we design an Adaptive Fusion Feature Enhancement Module (AFFE) to dynamically adjust the fusion strategy according to the contribution of features at different scales and reduce the information loss caused by feature dimensionality reduction to maximize the utility of each feature. We develop a novel Deep-Shallow Supervision (DSS) module to mitigate background noise using deep semantic information to guide shallow features without adding parameters. Additionally, we achieve model lightweighting through pruning techniques, ensuring competitive performance while reducing the number of parameters to only 4.5 % of the original. The experimental results show an improvement of 10. 4 % AP over existing methods, demonstrating the robustness of DURN for complex and damaged murals.

To assess the prevalence and associated risk factors of mange mites in small ruminants within the Sodo Zuria and Humbo districts of the Wolaita zone, a cross-sectional study employing systematic random sampling was conducted between October 2024 and March 2025. Out of 246 animals examined, 10.16 % (25/246) were found to be infected with mange mites, with goats showing a prevalence of 14.40 % (18 out of 125) and sheep at 5.79 % (7 out of 121). The results indicated a higher infection rate among adult animals (12.16 %) compared to younger ones (7.14 %), and those from lowland areas (16 %) faced a greater prevalence than animals from highland regions (4.13 %). Significant statistical relationships (p < 0.05) were identified between the occurrence of mange mites and various factors, including environmental conditions, age, body site, and management practices. Among the different species of mites identified, Sarcoptes was the most common, accounting for 6.91 % of cases. This research highlights an escalating health threat posed by mites to small ruminants in the area, underscoring the urgent need for intervention strategies. It also stresses the importance of targeted acaricide applications and enhanced management practices in high-risk lowland agro-ecological zones.}

To evaluate student experiences with the Independent Authentic Clinical Reasoning Task (I-ACRT), an assessment designed to elicit unaided clinical judgment in nursing students by restricting generative AI use.
Background
AI tools are rapidly transforming nursing education. While they enhance access and efficiency, overreliance can impair independent reasoning. The I-ACRT was developed to preserve foundational clinical judgment by replicating authentic practice conditions while removing AI and peer input.
Methods
Student reflections were drawn from open-ended responses on end-of-course evaluations in a junior-level BSN course. Evaluations were anonymous and collected through a third-party platform. Comments explicitly referencing I-ACRTs were coded and analyzed thematically using NVivo. A total of 11 student responses met inclusion criteria. This study was an exploratory program evaluation using qulitative descriptive methodology and inductive content analysis.
Results
Four major themes emerged: (1) Cognitive adjustment, including initial frustration and increased fluency across attempts; (2) Desire for coaching, especially in preparation and feedback; (3) Desire for greater clarity in task expectations; and (4) Perceived benefit, with students noting gains in conceptual understanding and preparedness for clinical reasoning. Students described the I-ACRT as cognitively demanding but ultimately valuable when paired with structured support.
Conclusions
The I-ACRT is a feasible and effective model for assessing foundational clinical reasoning in an AI-restricted environment. While initial cognitive load was high, students improved over time and valued the realism and independence the task required. Findings support further refinement of the I-ACRT model as a tool for preparing students to critically engage with AI in clinical practice.}

abstract = {We provide new experimental results on studies of the effect of applied stress on Reflection coefficient (S22 parameter) of Co-rich glass-coated ferromagnetic microwire measured using free space microwave spectroscopy. Studied Co-rich microwire with vanishing magnetostriction coefficient presents high Giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect associated with excellent soft magnetic properties. Tensile stress was applied through the mechanical load, attached to the single Co-rich microwire sample inside the anechoic chamber and the S22 parameter was measured at 2.45 GHz using broadband horn antennas and a vector network analyzer. Upon tensile stress (up to 225 MPa), we observed a substantial change in the S22 parameter. The change in the S22 parameter correlates with the stress dependence of hysteresis loops. The experimentally discovered stress dependence of the reflection coefficient allows for contactless stresses and damage monitoring of composites with microwire inclusions.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a revolutionary force in the constantly evolving technology landscape, transforming many industries, including libraries. Libraries have been focusing on experimenting with emerging AI technologies to innovate their services, especially for supporting entrepreneurs. Generative AI, for instance, ChatGPT, holds immense potential for libraries by enabling them to provide advanced support to entrepreneurs, for instance, meeting the business needs of the entrepreneurs, or strengthening entrepreneurial education programs. By concentrating on the adoption of generative AI, librarians will be encouraged to experiment and use their expertise in current generative AI technologies to test out future ones and adopt the more useful ones.
Method and analysis
The objective of the research is to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of ChatGPT technology by librarians in their provision of support for entrepreneurs. The research aims to provide insights that can help formulate the strategies for the successful adoption of ChatGPT technology in library settings to enhance their support for entrepreneurs. To achieve the research objective, the research study adopts a correlational research design that will empirically test the hypothesis- the relationship between latent variables affecting the three stages of technology adoption. Surveys will be administered to librarians actively engaged in assisting entrepreneurs, aiming to capture data on various factors influencing their adoption decisions, and hence aiding in empirical validation of the formulated hypothesis. Before commencing data collection, participants will be provided with a detailed informed consent sheet outlining the research's purpose, procedures involved, the voluntary nature of the participation, and potential risks involved. Only after participants have explicitly provided their consent are they granted access to the survey questionnaire. This ensures transparency and ethical compliance throughout the research process. To safeguard participant confidentiality and maintain data integrity, all research data will be securely stored in password-protected cloud storage platforms, such as University OneDrive. Strict data handling protocols will be followed, with access limited to authorized research team members. Moreover, participants' personal information will not be collected, ensuring anonymity and privacy. Stringent quality assurance measures will be implemented to ensure the reliability and validity of the research findings. Before survey administration, a pilot test will be conducted to refine the survey instrument and identify any ambiguities. The pilot testing will adhere to ethical guidelines and principles, including the mandatory nature of informed consent, as well as protocols for data storage, handling procedures, and safety considerations outlined for the main research study. Continuous monitoring and peer review processes will be employed to mitigate individual biases and errors, thereby enhancing the overall robustness of the research outcomes. Data cleaning procedures, including outlier detection and imputation techniques, will further reinforce the integrity and completeness of the dataset. Additionally, member checking with participants will ensure the accuracy and alignment of research interpretations with participants' perspectives, bolstering the credibility of the study findings. Through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the collected data will undergo rigorous analysis using the SmartPLS 4 software version, validating the complex relationships between different constructs of the theoretical model.
Discussion
The research will have both theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, it seeks to identify factors influencing ChatGPT adoption among librarians supporting entrepreneurs, enriching our understanding of technology adoption dynamics in library services. Practically, the findings offer actionable insights for librarians, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders supporting innovation. By uncovering adoption drivers and barriers, librarians can develop dynamic capabilities to experiment with emerging AI technologies, foster co-creation with patrons, and thereby strengthen entrepreneur support services. The results will also have greater implications for the countries where libraries are yet to be positioned as innovation actor supporting entrepreneurship.}

This lopsided dispensation has persisted as an enigma to be solved. Thus, a hypothesis is raised here that the Black Death, a plague pandemic caused by Yersinia pestis, which ravaged Europe in the fourteenth century and brought on a severe human extermination constituted the pathogenic selective pressure for factor V Leiden of which the procoagulative, anti-fibrinlolysis function, and the resultant resistance potential to Yersinia pestis infection have been demonstrated in a series of animal experiments and clinical observation. The same explanation is also proposed for a similar unbalanced distribution of prothrombin G20210A mutation, another thrombophilia genetic variant, between Caucasians and Asians despite awaiting more solid evidence in the near future. On the other hand, the fact that deficiency of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin had not risen during the plague disaster is theoretically attributed to more severe and fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with the dysfunction of them. The whole assumption implies an underlying evolutionary advantage of factor V Leiden and a mysterious relationship between genetic traits and diseases. It is hoped that future investigations dedicating to analysis of ancient DNA from human remains in the medieval cemeteries before, during, and after the plague will finally let the speculation come true.}

To assess the clinical reasoning capabilities of two large language models, ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0, compared to those of neonatal nurses during neonatal care scenarios.
Design
A cross-sectional study with a comparative evaluation using a survey instrument that included six neonatal intensive care unit clinical scenarios.
Participants
32 neonatal intensive care nurses with 5–10 years of experience working in the neonatal intensive care units of three medical centers.
Methods
Participants responded to 6 written clinical scenarios. Simultaneously, we asked ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 to provide initial assessments and treatment recommendations for the same scenarios. The responses from ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 were then scored by certified neonatal nurse practitioners for accuracy, completeness, and response time.
Results
Both models demonstrated capabilities in clinical reasoning for neonatal care, with Claude-2.0 significantly outperforming ChatGPT-4 in clinical accuracy and speed. However, limitations were identified across the cases in diagnostic precision, treatment specificity, and response lag.
Conclusions
While showing promise, current limitations reinforce the need for deep refinement before ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 can be considered for integration into clinical practice. Additional validation of these tools is important to safely leverage this Artificial Intelligence technology for enhancing clinical decision-making.
Impact
The study provides an understanding of the reasoning accuracy of new Artificial Intelligence models in neonatal clinical care. The current accuracy gaps of ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 need to be addressed prior to clinical usage.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have dominated public interest due to their apparent capability to accurately replicate learned knowledge in narrative text. However, there is a lack of clarity about the accuracy and capability standards of LLMs in health care examinations.
Objective
We conducted a systematic review of LLM accuracy, as tested under health care examination conditions, as compared to known human performance standards.
Methods
We quantified the accuracy of LLMs in responding to health care examination questions and evaluated the consistency and quality of study reporting. The search included all papers up until September 10, 2023, with all LLMs published in English journals that report clear LLM accuracy standards. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the assessment was not a health care exam, there was no LLM, there was no evaluation of comparable success accuracy, and the literature was not original research.The literature search included the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used in all possible combinations: “artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” “GPT,” “LLM,” “large language model,” “machine learning,” “neural network,” “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” “Generative Transformer,” “Generative Language Model,” “Generative Model,” “medical exam,” “healthcare exam,” and “clinical exam.” Sensitivity, accuracy, and precision data were extracted, including relevant CIs.
Results
The search identified 1673 relevant citations. After removing duplicate results, 1268 (75.8%) papers were screened for titles and abstracts, and 32 (2.5%) studies were included for full-text review. Our meta-analysis suggested that LLMs are able to perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.61 (CI 0.58-0.64) and a United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) accuracy of 0.51 (CI 0.46-0.56), while Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) can perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.64 (CI 0.6-0.67).
Conclusions
LLMs offer promise to remediate health care demand and staffing challenges by providing accurate and efficient context-specific information to critical decision makers. For policy and deployment decisions about LLMs to advance health care, we proposed a new framework called RUBRICC (Regulatory, Usability, Bias, Reliability [Evidence and Safety], Interoperability, Cost, and Codesign–Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement [PPIE]). This presents a valuable opportunity to direct the clinical commissioning of new LLM capabilities into health services, while respecting patient safety considerations.

keywords = {Urate, Reference values, Cardiometabolic syndrome, Urato, Valores de referencia, Síndrome cardiometabólico},
abstract = {Background
Urate is the final product of purine catabolism, and its levels have been linked to various cardiometabolic disorders. In Mexico, most epidemiological data on urate levels derive from populations with existing comorbidities, limiting the establishment of normative reference values.
Objective
To characterize the distribution of serum urate concentrations in a healthy adult population residing in Mexico City.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 3099 healthy adults (64.6% women) enrolled in the Tlalpan 2020 cohort. Participants with chronic diseases, abnormal blood pressure or glucose levels, or exposure to urate-altering medications were excluded. Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were recorded, and serum urate concentrations were analyzed overall and stratified by sex.
Results
The median serum urate level in the overall cohort was 5.16mg/dL (interquartile range, 4.32–6.15), with a central 95% reference interval ranging from 3.05 to 7.98mg/dL. Median urate levels differed significantly by sex: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) in women and 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) in men. The prevalence of hyperuricemia in the total cohort was 16.5%, notably higher in men (28.4%) compared to women (10.0%).
Conclusion
This study establishes sex-specific reference values for serum urate in a healthy Mexican adult population. The findings may inform clinical decision-making and future research on urate-related risk stratification.
Resumen
Antecedentes
El urato es el producto final del catabolismo de las purinas y su concentración se ha asociado con diversos trastornos cardiometabólicos. En México, la mayoría de los datos epidemiológicos sobre los niveles de urato provienen de poblaciones con comorbilidades existentes, lo que limita el establecimiento de valores de referencia normativos.
Objetivo
Caracterizar la distribución de las concentraciones séricas de urato en una población adulta sana residente en la Ciudad de México.
Métodos
Se realizó un análisis transversal utilizando datos de 3,099 adultos sanos (64.6% mujeres) incluidos en la cohorte Tlalpan 2020. Se excluyeron participantes con enfermedades crónicas, cifras anormales de presión arterial o glucosa, o exposición a medicamentos que alteran el urato. Se registraron parámetros clínicos, antropométricos y bioquímicos, y las concentraciones de urato se analizaron de forma global y estratificadas por sexo.
Resultados
La mediana de urato sérico en la cohorte fue de 5.16mg/dL (rango intercuartílico: 4.32–6.15), con un intervalo de referencia (95%) que oscila entre 3.05 y 7.98mg/dL. Las concentraciones de urato difirieron significativamente por sexo: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) en mujeres y 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) en hombres. La prevalencia de hiperuricemia en la cohorte total fue de 16.5%, siendo mayor en hombres (28.4%) que en mujeres (10.0%).
Conclusión
Este estudio establece valores de referencia de urato específicos por sexo en una población mexicana adulta sana. Los hallazgos pueden ser útiles para la toma de decisiones y para futuras investigaciones sobre la estratificación del riesgo relacionado con el urato.}

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, is transforming healthcare by offering novel ways to synthesize and communicate medical knowledge. This development is especially relevant in cardiology, as patient education, clinical decision-making, and administrative workflows play pivotal roles in this area. ChatGPT, originally built on GPT-3 and refined into GPT-4, can simplify complex cardiology literature, translate technical explanations into plain language, and address questions across different linguistic backgrounds. Studies show that although ChatGPT demonstrates considerable promise in performing text-based tasks—ranging from passing portions of the European Exam in Core Cardiology to creating patient-friendly educational materials—its inability to interpret images remains a major limitation. Meanwhile, concerns around false information, data bias, and ethical issues highlight the need for careful oversight. Future directions include integrating LLMs with computer-vision modules for image-based diagnostics and combining unstructured patient data to improve risk prediction and phenotyping. Social-media research suggests that chatbots sometimes provide more-empathetic responses than do physicians, underscoring both their potential advantages and complexities. LLM-based tools can also generate letters for insurance prior authorizations or appeals, helping reduce administrative burden. New multimodal approaches, such as ChatGPT Vision, have the potential to enable direct image processing, although clinical validation of this function is yet to be established. The judicious integration of ChatGPT and other LLMs into cardiology requires ongoing validation, robust regulatory frameworks, and strong ethical guidelines to ensure patient privacy, avoid misinformation, and promote equitable healthcare delivery. This review aims to provide a primer on LLMs for cardiovascular professionals, summarizing key applications, current limitations, and prospects in this rapidly evolving field of digital health.
Résumé
L'intelligence artificielle (IA) générative, en particulier les grands modèles de langage (LLM) tels que ChatGPT, transforme les soins de santé en offrant de nouveaux moyens de synthétiser et de communiquer les connaissances médicales. Ceci est particulièrement pertinent en cardiologie, où l'éducation des patients, la prise de décision clinique et les flux de travail administratifs jouent un rôle central. ChatGPT, basé à l'origine sur GPT-3 et affiné dans GPT-4, peut simplifier la littérature complexe en cardiologie, traduire des explications techniques en langage clair et répondre à des questions provenant de différents contextes linguistiques. Les études montrent que si ChatGPT démontre un potentiel très prometteur pour les tâches basées sur le texte - qui vont de la réussite de certaines parties de l'examen européen de cardiologie de base à la création de matériel éducatif accessible aux patients - son incapacité à interpréter les images reste une limitation majeure. Par ailleurs, les inquiétudes concernant les renseignements faux, les biais de données et les questions éthiques soulignent la nécessité d'une supervision attentive. Les orientations futures comprennent l'intégration des LLM avec des modules de vision par ordinateur pour les diagnostics basés sur l'image et la combinaison de données non structurées sur les patients pour améliorer la prédiction des risques et le phénotypage. Les recherches sur les médias sociaux suggèrent que les agents conversationnels peuvent parfois fournir des réponses plus empathiques que les médecins, révélant des opportunités et les complications inhérentes. Pour les tâches administratives, les outils basés sur les LLM peuvent générer des lettres pour les demandes d'autorisation préalable ou des appels, contribuant ainsi à réduire la charge administrative. De nouvelles approches multimodales, telles que « ChatGPT Vision », pourraient à l'avenir permettre un traitement direct des images, bien que la validation clinique reste à établir. En fin de compte, l'intégration judicieuse de ChatGPT et d'autres LLM en cardiologie nécessitera une validation continue, des cadres réglementaires solides et des lignes directrices éthiques strictes pour garantir la confidentialité des patients, éviter la désinformation et promouvoir une prestation de soins de santé équitable. Cette étude a pour but de fournir aux professionnels de la santé cardiovasculaire une introduction aux LLM, en résumant les applications clés, les limites actuelles et les perspectives dans ce domaine de la santé numérique qui évolue rapidement.}

The National Library of Medicine’s Integrated Academic/Advanced Information Management Systems (IAIMS) initiative played a central role in the evolution of health informatics over the project’s lifetime (1983–2009) and continues to do so.
Aim
Our objective is to demonstrate how IAIMS and two key IAIMS concepts, integration and outreach, have functioned at very different times during this evolutionary process.
Approach
Using a framework drawn from Lorenzi and Stead’s 2021 history of IAIMS, we examine the role of integration and outreach in work at the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) in the early 1980s and at the University of Texas Arlington (UTA) in 2020.
Results
Guided by these concepts, UMB implemented a campus-wide information utility, while UTA established a center to accelerate research and innovation.
Conclusions
Outreach and integration have been formative in the evolution of health informatics and will continue to hold their power.}

Yet, contrary to traditional iris recognition applied to living individuals, post-mortem biometrics presents forensic experts and scientists with challenges that have previously been unknown and require novel approaches and development of new skills. This paper summarizes the current state of the art of research in this area, both with respect to studies exploring the feasibility of iris recognition in a forensic setting, as well as the challenges still pervasive in the scientific community and potential ways to overcome them. We argue that post-mortem iris biometrics can serve both as a way for improving iris recognition, as well as provide forensic examiners tools for extending knowledge and skills in their respective field.}

abstract = {Summary
Introduction
Simulated paediatric surgical training is inherently advantageous and flourishing. Moreover, several working conditions resulted in reduced training hours, index and subspecialty cases encountered, and the COVID-19 pandemic affected elective surgery backlogs, hence training opportunities. Hypospadias repair is technically-demanding and requires a spectrum of dissective and reconstructive skills. We therefore aimed to test a 3D-printed silicon model for hypospadias repair, in the context of hands-on surgical training.
Material and methods
Twenty-Seven trainees, under the supervision of 15 instructors, completed the activity. They were given a seminar to show the relevant anatomy, and 8 key steps of the exercise: (1)-degloving; (2)-urethral plate marking; (3)-incision; (4)-tubularisation; (5)-glansplasty/glanuloplasty; (6)-dartos layer preparation; (7)-preputioplasty and (8)-skin closure. Each trainee completed a structured feedback assessment. An on-site trainer supervised and evaluated each exercise. Trainees and trainers rated the model through the above steps from unsatisfactory-(1/5) to excellent-(5/5), presented herein via cross-sectional analysis.
Results
Eleven-(40.7 %) trainees were in years:1–3 of specialist training, 10-(37 %) were in years:4–6, and 6-(22.2 %) were beyond year-6. Two-(7.4 %) trainees had nil-hypospadias experience, 16-(59.2 %) previously assisted in procedures or performed steps, 5-(18.5 %) performed whole procedures supervised and 4-(14.8 %) independently. Twenty-(74 %) trainees and 15-(100 %) instructors judged the model to resemble the anomaly. Seventeen-(63 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated the material needle-penetrability ≥3/5, compared to human tissue. Sixteen-(59 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated the material suture holding ≥3/5. Eleven-(73.3 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated sutures’ evenness and edge coaptability ≥3/5.
Discussion
Hypospadias is an index operation, which requires precision skills. Simulated training in Paediatric Surgery and Urology is gaining importance. 3D-printed models are gaining a key role in simulated training. The study presents a novel 3D-printed high-fidelity silicon-based hypospadias model designed for hands-on training. A structured pathway to divide a standard hypospadias repair into key steps is displayed to ensure skill acquisition and stabilisation.
Conclusion
This 3D-printed silicon-based hypospadias model is proven useful for hands-on training. The fidelity can still improve, especially regarding suture holding of the material.

Implemented in a postgraduate Business Economics course at a business school in Singapore, the intervention embedded ChatGPT across four Executive MBA cohorts (n = 87) using scenario-based prompting, Socratic inquiry, and transcript-annotated reflection. Comparative analysis with four demographically matched traditional cohorts (n = 93) revealed that GenAI-supported instruction significantly improved assignment performance. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression confirmed that AI integration was a robust and statistically significant predictor of higher scores, even after controlling for demographic and professional background variables. Simultaneous quantile regression further showed that lower-performing students experienced the greatest gains, highlighting the intervention's equalizing potential. Beyond these quantitative results, students demonstrated more structured economic reasoning and deeper conceptual application. By emphasizing faculty agency, ethical AI use, and inquiry-based design, this model offers a scalable and replicable approach for integrating GenAI in executive education.}
