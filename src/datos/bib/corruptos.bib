    abstract = "It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2025, held July 21-23, 2025 in Palermo, Italy.L@S investigates large-scale, technology-mediated learning environments that typically have many active learners and few experts on hand to guide their progress or respond to individual needs. The conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. Over the years, the conference has evolved and is now one of the most relevant venues for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed by technology.The aim of L@S is to address real-world educational challenges and simultaneously contribute to a fundamental understanding of human learning. Together, our goal is to investigate how data and technology can be leveraged to create more responsible and effective learning experiences for all learners across the globe. The theme of L@S 2025 is Learning Synergies @ Scale. As technology continues to reshape education, at the L@S 2025 conference we explore how generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its new possibilities can be leveraged to better support learning across the lifespan. L@S 2025 explores the impact of AI on learning with an emphasis on scalability and the broader impact of technological advances in learning environments. As a community we address the challenges of applying scalable, technology-driven solutions in both structured institutional environments and dynamic, self-directed learning communities, especially those that provide actionable insights for equitable and effective adaptive learning experiences. Creating synergies between research and practice, and contributing to breaking down barriers between the two, we present research co-informed by practice at scale.",

Throughout three decades, AVI has gained and holds a prestigious position among International HCI conferences, boasting a dedicated nucleus of returning participants, but also providing a venue for young researchers to show their achievements and establish contacts with senior community members.AVI 2024 presents a broad and sound scientific program covering traditional AVI topics on information and data visualization, interaction with multimodal user interfaces, augmented and virtual reality, while also addressing emerging topics including the application of generative artificial intelligence in HCI design and evaluation.The program features the presentation of 21 long research papers and 28 short papers selected through a rigorous double-blind reviewing process and organized into sessions on 13 main topics. Furthermore, it includes the presentation of 48 poster papers, 9 demo papers, and 11 doctoral consortium papers, selected through a single-blind reviewing process. Finally, the rich and vibrant program includes 3 keynote talks, 3 tutorials, and 10 workshops addressing some of the most exciting issues in HCI.Submissions to AVI 2024 came from 34 different countries distributed in descending order in Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and Africa.",
